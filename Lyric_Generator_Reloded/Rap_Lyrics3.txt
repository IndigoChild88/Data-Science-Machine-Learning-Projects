[Intro]

(Woman speaking in Spanish)
Tu eres una persona que tiene muchos suenos
Y mucho de Los suenos se complen
Y se manifestan en tu vida si tu cres
En Esos suenos


[Verse 1]
I see good things coming ahead
Learn to let go that's what the medium said
I asked for more but she told me don't get greedy instead
See the secret is to fall down and get up again
I Had a dream of finding gold
Somewhere across the globe
So I set sail but I would never sell my soul
Gypsy doll told me faith is all You need to go
And the journey there will teach you
Anything you need know
Met a humble King who told me
Pack light and travel far
And when you get lost that's when you find who you are
If you give into your fears you can't talk to your heart
And when you're lost just remember
You're a Light in the dark
Keep your eyes to the stars
And just follow the Omems
Doesn't matter how to get there
If you know where you going
There's signs all around keep your eyes wide open
Everybody won't make it, only  some get chosen
This is something that you gotta do for yourself
And when you want it bad enough
The universe will help
Told  momma good bye
Cause I'm out to find gold
But little did I know that I was searching  for myself
Met  theives on the way that tried to steal my joy
They spoke words against my dream
But I killed that noise
I helped a snake on the road that tried to kill that boy
Appreciate what's real you can't fill that void
Gotta give love to get it
Love life to live it
There's too many people busy building up their own prison
The King told me
Mac tube , which means it was written
Remember  there's a reason for the vision you were given
Everything's connected
You're a part of everything
Everyone you meet
Is either hell or heaven sent
Angels singing melodic
My dad was an alcoholic
And I pop champagne and can't help but think about
My mother was an angel
But I wasn't a saint
My mama never had much but she never complained
Some times My demons spoke louder than my angels
Which got me into trouble but I learned from my mistakes
You either find your gold or leave it out there buried
I hope Find yourself before your times up hurry
You can make it anywhere as long as you don't worry
I pray you never lose faith
Good Luck on your journey

(Beat changes)

It's all part of it
Part of everything

[Verse 2]
Riding with a man named Faysal Alfassi
My dad with work with his family in Saudi
Summer 09 I moved out to Pine Tree
And he exposed my to a new life on South Beach
Bentley, Ferrari, McClaren, he had all 3
Looking for the next young spitter that's when they called me
That's when my whole vision changed
Spent that whole summer poppin champagne
Back when Jeezy the recession stayed on repeat
17 in the club like these hoes see me
Before I was ever old enough to see a rated R movie I was pissing champagne like Dom Pee Gee
Got some gas money we was headed south
Straight to south beach mama asking bout my whereabouts
Under age Ace of Spades I had a fair amount
But the music was all I really cared about
Young n*gga couldn't wait to spit
Trying to drop a hit waiting on it only made me sick
I took the off trail route and in the midst of it all
You'll never make it with the ones you thought you'd make it with
Shout out to Fay
Fay taught me faith
Popping Champagne and prayed 5 times a day
Sometimes this life just works out in its way
But it's Royal for life wear that crown to the  grave



(WULF)
(Bridge)
I hope every road that you travel got the smoothest gravel
And I hope when you cross the sea wind takes your sail
I hope the skeleton in your trunk don't get you rattled
But if you turn around to me I won't be here

(chorus)
Don't lose site you know where you're going
Don't let them get to you
You'll get through, yeah
And this won't last it's all part of the journey babe
Don't let it worry to you
That's not you, ohh
You know where your going
You know how to get there
Don't let it worry you
Don't let it worry you, Yeah
You know where your going
You know how to get there
Dont let it worry you
Don't let it worry you, yeah yeah

But Good luck on your Journey
You deserve Good Luck
Good Luck on Journey
You deserve Good Luck
Good Luck on your journey
You deserve Good Luck
Good Luck on your Journey
You deserve Good Luck[Verse 1: BZZY]

Behind the scenes nigga, I'm a new breed of rapper, two mixtapes in two months. Who the fuck toppin' that man? Mississippi, well connected to the A nigga, holla at me

[Verse 1:]
I hit the scene and tote a whole fuckin' stripper pole
I'm on the corner sellin' (?) like a mini mall
Tell these niggas either get rich or die tryin'
The CD's sound like shit, so we ain't buyin'
Told these niggas better get they fuckin' stacks up
(?) canary yellow on the fuckin' Lac truck
Go to Georgia and get love in the A
They know the Killer K, I make it here today
I been real, been down, since I left the womb
Got it for the low so they don't fuck with you
White T, Air 1's on my fuckin' feet
Athlete of the year, trap star of the week
Where the Hemi at? I ran a lot of streets
I'm like a butcher nigga, I serve a lot of beef
I got swagger like Jimmy and that's real
DJ Folk and BK, hey that's (?)

[Hook: x2]
I went from no name nigga to the next thing blowing up
K-R-I-T I'm the best thing going
When it comes to the streets
Watch me get 100,000 off some motherfuckin' beats

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I told them niggas better see me on top
The industry is fucked man, they need me on top
I'm from that Magnolia state, I bring it back
First album I drop, seeing platinum plaques
I'm official nigga, certified, the price is right
The K next to blow bitch, that's the facts of life
If your family matter, watch what you say to Folk
I make a ho sit down like (?)
I seen boys stand up and get knocked down
I seen OG's run from that choppa sound
Do your own thing K, that's what D said
(?) a bakery nigga, so I'mma make bread
I got that fresh shit boy, hey I bet they love it
The haters gonna hate, but I bet they dug it
I'm like a secret that these niggas lock up in they closet
But in reality they know the K the fuckin' hottest

[Hook: x2][Chorus]
Like it was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Big money, subwoofer, Randy Savage
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
MC 24 crawling through the traffic
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Rolling clean, hella screen, digi-dashed it
It was 1986, coldest year ever
Mama coulda cut me out the womb but she knew better

[Verse 1]
Digi my dash, this for the playas
That got them some golds and copped them some gators
Fresh than a motherfucker I knew what it took
The thing that I'm giving you couldn't get out a book
Now don't be tricking no hoes, don't be lending your ride
And if you fuck, wear a rubber 'cause they burning inside
If it don't pay whatcha asking then you wasting your time
If you can't get you no old school don't go fucking with mine

[Chorus]
Like it was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Big money, subwoofer, Randy Savage
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
MC 24 crawling through the traffic
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Rolling clean, hella screen, digi-dashed it
It was 1986, coldest year ever
Mama coulda cut me out the womb but she knew better

[Verse 2]
Watching for jackers, scoping for law
They go to hating when I'm bassing cause I swang and I crawl
Scraping the wall, rubbing the curb
A chef with the whipping, my trunk shaken and stirred
I got a fetish for Chevys, an itch for the doller
On the hunt for a freak, down to fuck if she swallow
I be popping my collar till I'm dead in a tomb
Hell, I been popping my collar since I fell out the womb

[Chorus]
Like it was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Big money, subwoofer, Randy Savage
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
MC 24 crawling through the traffic
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Rolling clean, hella screen, digi-dashed it
It was 1986, coldest year ever
Mama coulda cut me out the womb but she knew better

[Bridge]
It feels good to have it
Knowing that I did what I could
It feels good to have it
I put the leather on top of the wood
It feels good to have it
I rode chrome all around my streets
It feels good to have it
To see it, to need it, to grab it
Feels good to have it

[Chorus]
Like it was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Big money, subwoofer, Randy Savage (think it over)
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
MC 24 crawling through the traffic (think it over)
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Rolling clean, hella screen, digi-dashed it (think it over)
It was 1986, coldest year ever
Mama coulda cut me out the womb but she knew better[Intro: Lloyd]
Aw yeah
Drop it for a nigga
That ass up

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
She say I only love the way she drop it, well maybe so
She say I'll probably leave if she don't pop it, we'll never know
Cause she get down on us, scrub the ground on it, with no shame
Give her time on it, roll around on it, do her thang
I ain't, the type to trick but she go hard for the cause
Type to bust it open wide and have me close down the mall
We ain't, gotta take it slow, she's-a hit the door
Let it show, for the give and go, get it on the flo'
Woo, ayy, shake it like you never ever got to shake it
If pussy popping was a college, she done graduated
She need a bow for that ass just to celebrate it
A lot of clapping and a standing ovation when she

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I be in the streets with my woes
And I be on the creep all the time with these hoes
Can't help that I'm a freak and it shows
See I be eating pussy, kissing titties, sucking toes
Million dollar nigga since a youngin
And if the police coming then I'm runnin'
And if I go to jail then my baby post the bail
Nigga, nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothing
She got some ugly ass ways
Aw, but she sure look fine
She know how to blow my mind
When she drop that ass for me like it's 1999

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
You know I love you shorty, or maybe I'm just kidding
But the way you pop that, pop that pussy, shit I'm all up in it, tightly fitted
Bounce that ass up, got to climb up the pole
If she ever hit the stage, I'ma be at her show
Cause she my favorite life, favorite type
That bust it open, bust it baby, but she lady like
Ooh, I'm talking head wraps and sundresses, heels for her flexing
Ain't no time she won't lend me that box, it need stretching
On the late night
She got the kind of glove to catch me if the play's right
That fly you out, you and that ass have a safe flight
And I'ma be there when she lands
Cause she never stood a chance in that bow-legged stance
Told her back that ass up

[Hook: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

[Chorus]
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I wasn't perfect at all, but you picked up for my calls
You textin', you ask if I eat right
All alone without me you don't sleep right
Tossin' and turnin', your incense is burnin'
A lot of learnin' about each other now
We were best friends before we was lovers
So how could we bring each other down
I gotta be out, you need to breathe now, 'cause
We ain't on the same page, no
Ain't slept together in days, and
The hugs and the kisses turn to waves
The love that we had turn to pain
And you still hold it down 'cause you feel it
100 forever like really though, really

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

[Chorus]
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

[Verse 2]
A whole lotta understanding for sure
My time ain't demanding no more
You tryna figure out the best play
To be there for me in the best way
I'm tryna save you from the heartache
I just wanna smile like we used to
And maybe we can come back in the future
And find what we lost in the move and I mean that
Truly, I know what can happen when
You break the heart of a woman
The moment you capture it
And everything used to be passionate
Now it all feels like a accident
All of the years of imagining
All of the happenings
Maybe we rushing
But I knew I could trust you to keep it 100, 100

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

[Chorus]
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

[Outro]
That day
And I almost just lost a good thing (That day)
And I almost just lost a good thing (That day)
And I almost just lost a good thing (That day)
Turn the lights on[Intro:]
Right now we'd like to bring on a young make who believes in doing things his own way. Based on the way he (?) all the folks who've seen him work, his way has gotta be pretty hip. So lets make some noise

[Hook:]
In 2000 and beyond

[Verse 1:]
Tricks and hoes, bitches and stripper poles
Shake it for dollar signs, let me see from behind
The ghetto's a fairytale, pimps and Jazzabells
Dealers with chrome rims with products for you to sell
Chemistry in the kitchen, alleys with rubber in it
Tires go round and round, windows heavy tinted
Kush is scented inside, pull me over
Now they talkin bout a K9 (Code 6), black man face down
Charge it to game, bums warm their weary souls over open flames
Junkie can't find God watch him find his vein
Preacher walk by like he ain't seen a thang
Pass the collection plate
Niggas thought shit was gonna change on election day
Healthcare H1N1 nasal spray
Got me scared to hit the block
Wear my flag as a mask, tote a Glock, in 2000 and beyond

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Poor folk scrape dollars and spend the last of their income tax
On impalas with the S-S, church gives awards to the best dress
Pastor drive a Bentley, got me thinkin, I was the less blessed
Cause I let a middle man, he was cappin' with em askin'
I dont understand, how you fit that many rings on a helping hand
Tired of deception, but I pay his kid's tuition cause I'm tryna get to heaven
Ain't it crazy, scared to have a baby
How can I protect it from the same streets that made me?
Concrete gladiator blood shed overflowin
In real life some places Russell Crowe will never go
Pimp tight flossin, look at what it cost me
Peace of mind no sleep late night tossin and turnin
Waitin' on the end, pray to God forgive me for my sins, in 2000 and beyond

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
As a child I was cold with a chip on my shoulder
Grandma told me be careful cause ther're sharks in the water
They will kill you, let the good lord steer you
Don't worry bout the government
Cause baby they dont feel you
Martin Luther King had dream, we was right there
I wonder what he saw when up and had nightmares
Quite scared, all the work he had done
Couldn't stop what we've become, in 2000 and beyond

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
(Ain't nothin' I say gon' get me outta this. But things were gettin' bad for me and I had to do what I had to do to survive)[Hook:]
I'm going two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Everybody sees me
Everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Everybody sees me
Everybody sees me

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Rollin in this caddy ho looking like yo daddy ho
Say you from the wood but I know you from the valley though
Always got yo hand out man you know these cali hoes
My life is a video but you ain’t got no cameo
Call me the banana boat let me see your cantaloupe
Don't invite your homegirls them hoes look like antelopes
She want me to ram her though, right on the pia-a-no
I was like a-ah no, Fuck am I D'angelo?
Yes I a-a-am a pro, and I seen your bitch before
And she told me this before, Yes I a-am a ho
And I want to leave you but you just won't let me g-go
She want me to change her life, I got her a change of clothes
Million dollars ain't a lot, niggas just be aiming low
We eating good
Smokin great
Working hard
Gamin' hoes
Skypin' hoes
Chattin' hoes
Textin' hoes
Aiming hoes
Feeling's unexplainable, You know I hit things to go

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T]
I'm talkin Slow downed, Screwed up, in a old school with a low tint
Bad broad, love to fuck, with her head down and her ass bent
No money spent, cruise the scene, put on game to pursue a dream
Don’t be fraternizing with these lame niggas, You need a king well I'm Akeem
Earth stood still when I dropped my top and I step my foot out the door
See the wonderful smell, and compliments on a pimp
And you wonder just how she chose
See I wasn't just riding high I was sittin' sky high I don't walk on feet, I soar
Y'all speedin' to fast with ya foot on the gas and 2 miles per hour on these hoes
Go 2 miles per hour and I roll, in an old school drop top
And keep the bass on bump jabbawockee in the trunk, my shit done pop locked
And I ain't trippin' on yours shawty don't get no burn if the broad ain't top notch
I'm above the rim with my chrome spinnin', yo clique just boxed out, I'm goin

[Hook:][Intro]
So it don't really matter how much money I do gain over life
It just if I owe my homies and my partners back in the day
I gotta give back man, believe that though
Yeah, believe that there

[Hook]
I bought a bag of hot fries, hotdog and a drink
I put the rest off in the tank
I owe you 30 dollars
I had to pay you that
What kind of friend would I be?
If I ain't pay you back
I bought a 40 and a magazine
Of all the cars,hoes, clothes
That i never seen
I owe you 30 dollars
I had to pay you that
What kind of friend would I be?
If I ain't pay you back

[Verse 1]
Multi sweats with the multi tee
Before I had the multi clothes you could multi me
Multi million dolllar dreams rolled in dirt
Colt 45 still reserved, irk and jerk
Cop a fifth for the 599
Little caesers hot and ready
That's gon' hold us down
I had a scheme to get rich
And Imma show you how
I can't pay no bills
I know shit is real
But thank you for the couch
And that chick that came through
I thought I loved her
I'm glad you saw my checks
And shot a young player rubbers
Winter time cold bought a young player covers
Eviction notice on the door
I'm sorry for  the trouble
I ain't have no job
But the beats was a thing to our soul
And that bass filled the space
When the heater was broke
And all those hamburger helper meals
That sat on the stove
Almost made a nigga sick cause the mixture was old
Its funny how that funny style shit never changes
Humbling, niggas ain't come up how we came up
So now the steak medium plus
Medium well, way too tough
Worst cut, it ain't medium much
Plate 4 hundred degrees, hot boy to the touch
Sweet potato casserole, nigga, fuck with the crust
Imma shoot the shot if need be, I live for the clutch
Stopped sipping drank, it had us on lean like a crutch
Nowadays it's a stand up game
No sitting room in my vault, I got stand up change
Wine tasting and a billion talk
And stocks in the villa route
The only time I tell a chick to taste it and spit it out
Long way from the boxes of wine
Roasting Louis 13 under candle for shine
Copping shit they'll never stock
Shoes they'll never drop
My music got way too much bounce
It'll never flop
They some lames in a bubble
They'll never pop
Puppets on a string
Shuck and jive call them fraggle rocks
But we cut from a different cloth
Safari, my nigga that's a different cost
See the smoke, garlic, aeoli, that's a different sauce
Invisible set with the grill, that's a different floss
Making toast for the blessings, I'm a different boss
Losing friends over bread, that's a different loss
So just in case I never told you before
Let me pay back what I owe
So just in case I never told you before
Let me pay back what I owe

[Verse 1:]
I ain't never been the type to be a lame, a hater
My flow is like precious wine, I get greater, later
And only time will tell if I will prevail over the fiction
Now the (?) came out, everybody wants his digits
Call him up the streets about this (?) is he versatile? Does he have a banjo as his picture?
We can make a million and I promise that we'll bomb that
But first give up your 99 percent and sign this contract
For nothin', a little bit of fame and some hoes
And I'll retire age of 40 platinum with no (?)
I'd rather not, I hit the block and smoke a lot out the trunk
My pockets big and fat in due time just like the Trumps
Fiend after fiend would get addicted to this (?)
A&Rs got their first hit now they get back
Get stacks, that's what a wise man told me
I took that to the heart and fed it times three

[Hook:] x4
I can be your guide or your coach
Deep down in the bottom of that 3rd Coast

[Verse 2:]
Wake up, wash my face, get clean, and check my phone
Pull out the freshest T I got and throw my Forces on
(?) crease, fitted cap, sittin' low
My mind frame is country, so country is all I know
Reach my grandma in my morning, she swear I don't get rest
She won't let me leave the house until I eat me up some breakfast
Wants me to cut my chin hair and fix my pants
I tell her just who I am and eventually she'll understand
Grab the door knob, with the (?) on my own
While some return home, but mostly remain gone
In that street war, where surviving is so irrelevant
The only representation I got is them dead presidents
I'm on guard, more than ever I pray to God
I worked so hard to get my equal rights, I paid my tithes
My music bumpin', years ago I was onto something
But what do I do my nigga? Truly I'm only country
But that was then, this is now, and was forever
Is my own go in stride to find me something better
Then what lies beneath me, increasing my interviews
While labels calculate my net-worth and revenue
I speak for the hood, ghetto thinking, and ghetto livin'
I embody the ghetto people and ghetto children
I am that, you that man, your coach
Your guide down deep in the Earth to third coast

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Buy these motherfucking stocks
Buy these motherfucking stocks[Hook:]
Hoes drop tops like I drop tops
4eva and a day shawdy pimpin' don't stop
Niggas road kill like I roll wheels
Breaking hoes down like pines and drug deals
Once a bitch ho she get down on the floor
And once she get down she get down like a pro
Man Hol' up, Ho' up, tow up, we gone show out
Show up, slow up, don't roll, bitch what you know bout

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Krizzle on the gas, smash my digital dab lab
150 like mad megs, I pull up and act bad
On chicken that cluck, cluck
Hop in but don't touch the
Buttons if you fuckin'
You so welcome in my cutlass
On the seat like get it right, get it in
Goin' hard on boulevard with candy car my freaks a ten
Even when the bill closed, back door, sneak 'em in
Then bust it wide open and they know we'll never meet again
Thats just how it is when everywhere the broads on ya
I pull up on the curb, as long as hoods got corners
Ain't searchin' for no stragglers, I accompany the loners
Here pimpin' served cold, but you can still smell the aroma
I take 'em to a
Higher plane givin' game to the lames for fee
Paid to told to get throwed because this ain't for free
I am what they not, what they claim to be

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Swinging down on 'em in somethin' they never seen
In the old school back to the future feelin' supreme
Super clean super hard ho, I got it on lock now
Propellers lookin' stellar I might just chop the block down
Why stop now? D-ah up in box hot
How I do it when I does some shit we don't talk 'bout
Its all in the game, your man just a lame
I'm just tryin' to put some pressure on your 5-4 frame
Ain't a damn thang changed but the way I get the cheese
Got 'em waitin' on they knees when I touch-down overseas
Hell yea I got the keys, but I ain't talkin' bout no bricks
I'm talkin' upscale bed & breakfast hippin', hittin' lits
Don't nobody talk shit, the way I talk shit
When I step in, they strip, they know its big son bitch
You can't deny it when I'm shinin', tell them all sales are final
Think yo' girl won't bring me mines, then yo' ass in denial

[Hook:][Chorus]
They said it couldn't be forever, wouldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over what would I say?
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, watch what I say
4eva n a day

[Verse 1]
My momma say "What's up Big, how ya feel?"
I dedicate this to them haters that's in my grill
Them doubters and them non-believers that said I wouldn't
And them A&Rs when I spit them bars that said I couldn't
And them bourgie broads that wasn't fucking when I was broke
Now they squeeze by to the V-I so I can jump down they throat
I put it on the line and do what I love and above all have hope
That it was meant for me and it was meant to be then it'll pay off like it's s'posed

[Chorus]
They said it couldn't be forever, wouldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over what would I say?
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, watch what I say
4eva n a day

[Verse 2]
They tryna say that I switched up, but most of them niggas done bitched up
If you ain't 'bout your own people, what you gon' raise your fists for?
Old school with them kickers, like karate feet, my money stretch like Pilates be
If you never been to the top it's something that you gotta see
Somewhere that you gotta be, I never dealt with the lames
Knock on wood but I'm hella good in this candy paint
No time to waste, keep my pace, forever still
Worry about you and how you live, I did it big, I hurt they feelings

[Chorus]
They said it couldn't be forever, wouldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over what would I say?
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, watch what I say
4eva n a day

[Verse 3]
I dedicate this third verse to all the candy coaters and the slab riders
Record breakers that did mad favors when they knew no one ever heard about us
And them playa pimps, Chevy donks that crank the thump 'til the trunk beat
Cross love from a bad broad that jump in cause she fuck with me
In the hood selling CDs cause they showed love at the Mom & Pops
'Til I sold em all even when my buzz was small and still chose to cop
Fact remains that I’m still the same and I’ll never change or settle
Cause I ain't tripping on mainstream cause love from the underground, that's forever
Now, that's forever

[Chorus]
They said it couldn't be forever, wouldn't be forever
The grain ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the leather
Your grind ain't enough, you gotta mix it with the hate
When it's all over what would I say?
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day
4eva n a day, watch what I say
4eva n a day[Hook:]
I did it for the ones that never had
The players that never will
Ride old schools ingrained in
Wheels of Steel
I know about the slums and hard times
Boats and sewers lines
Cops that kick doors in
Black eye shines
This more than rhymes
I do it for the ones

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I ain't the one for politicin'
Just liquor bottle sippin'
One the corners with my partners talkin' life after death
And the meaning of empty boxes that sit on my shelf
Too real to beg for meals, too proud to ask for help
I know we pray, we sell weed, married for life
To this game we in my friend passed the rice
Lets get it, more than we got it
Fillin' my pockets
With petty dreams, of being king of parking lot and
My homie lobby until they shot him
Polo down blood spotted, so why bother
Being fresh, when you ain't fly enough for death
I don't do this for my health
But for those that ain't here

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Bobby Creekwater]
I do it for those with less fortune
They ain't got a lot but yet they still bless they portion
My mic got distortion but I talk this shit regardless
Thankful for my oddness in the neighborhood that birthed me
But then I talk that shit that make the government research me
Yea, I do my best, Pimp is gone, Bun here, after death I do the rest
How do me, and hopefully, they may say easy to do you
Know you feel like its in vain sometimes, nigga, we do too
We boohoo
Then we laugh, then we get up off our ass
Quietly acquire fortune so we yellin' free at last
We are so much more than any condo we ever closed
Can we keep if we get it, shit we never know

This for the three, this for the house
This for the crib, this for the South

[Verse 1]
I swang and I swerve
Nigga like, "Who need a curve?"
Old school sittin' on high
Nigga like, "Who need some herb?"
Watch for the birds, watch for them laws
Nigga they dirty as dirt
Trying to rough a nigga up, cuff a nigga up
Bust a nigga up, claim he got the work
Just because we flying flossed out
Never been a worker, always bossed out
When you come from the mud, you get it out the mud
Now look at what the mud cost now
Creepin' on A street, Cali Park
Knockin' these doors down after dark
Searching for a cornbread, collard green
Eating thorough bread, thick from the start
Got it from my mama mama, but tote the tool for the drama
But go to college for a education
They ain't fucking with you with no commas
Goin' places in the south, buy land, own a house
Redline representer, Juneteenth turn ya' out

[Chorus]
This for the three, this for the house
This for the crib, this for the South
This for the porch, this for the Sip'
This for them summers, this for the country
This for the coast, this for them buses
This for them players doing the most
This for the three, this for the house
This for the crib, this for the South
This for the porch, this for the Sip'
This for them summers, this for the country
This for the coast, this for them buses
This for them players doing the most

[Verse 2]
What you knew 'bout that grill that chill
That top and bottom, that's invisible set
Even granny had gold for real
Even granny had gold around her neck
Gotta let your light shine
Soon as they start hating at the right time
I went from 300 coming out hard, now I'm worldwide
Ask that, I was king way before rap
Came out the womb like fuck all the rules
If there was a bar then pass that straight where the cash at
Country boy tippy-toeing  (Uh)
25 on the dresser (Yes sir)
Did for the time, I freeze
Now batter that rustle, killing the pressure
Barely no effort, feel like a wrestler
Put on for the Sip', watch me out-rep ya
Moon-walkin', two-steppin', laid back no stretcher
Going places in the South, buy land on the house
Redline representer, queen city turn ya' out

[Chorus]
This for the three, this for the highs
This for the crib, this for the South
This for the porch, this for the Sip'

Time to rest yo eyes now I guess
You been runnin' all day
You've been due for some rest
Just ain't no need to strain in yo brain any longer
It's cool to dream those dreams that made you strong
Kept you fresh and on your toes
Forever EQing the highs and lows
Of today[Hook:]
If I got it, it’s swangin’

Ducked in my ‘Lac, 5th wheel in the back

And a flight attendant off in the back
Get a room at the hotel and it’s got be that 1-12
Hit the strip in the A-T-L about 1:12 and met 112
A bad bitch that know me, fetish just to blow me
Talk fast about the cash but suck me off so slowly
(?) my homies, hit the club and I buy the bar like Slim Thug (?)
Down here be (?)
No loss because I’m undefeated, never been beat by an underachiever
One reason my beats be beatin’, that program they call the reason
For the low any time or season, for any producer that wanna be me
On the 30 if you don’t believe me, you get it cuh, so come and see me
Live in more, I teach that ass, that (?) I teach that class
The one time chance you’ll never have, say you wanna do it big? You better pass

What a difference a day makes
What about all the effort that a day takes?
The winding road of uncertainty
That undying feeling of urgency
Did I do all that I could do to ensure my success?
Did I really give my all, and am I really at my best
...today?[Pre-hook]
Now usually I talk about that Cadillac on vogues

There he go again talking 'bout that candy paint
Slabbin' out, working wheel in the daytime
Don't settle for the trap, hi-hats and the clap
Bih', what you know about that bassline
Big booming, slip the lever
Haters grip for the backseat of the car like a fallen star
All these screens of light, I can charge at night
Ladies drink for free when they' at the bar
Pull up, barely stood up
High fiving every old school player tippin' in the lot
With a couple pretty things on they' shoulders
Then they told her "Krizzle gotta give 'em what you got"
So I kill 'em with the low
Joe Lewis knocking down doors
Grippin that wheel
They like "What happened to the lac?"
I told 'em 'bout this muscle

Glass house, I put the ass out
When I roll supreme, I call it creepin' clean
I hit the gas on the low when I'm on the scene
Ya I be waking up them neighbors with the 15's when I vroom
Candy paint on the fleet
6 deep with the slab, ballin' in these street
Pull up on the curb - what the fuck, what you heard?
I swang and I swerve, I'm swangin' for keeps

But first we head to the spot so we can get totally drilled out

Now what you think that I came here for?
To buy (?) for my Adidas? No!

Drinking that lady pipe, don't say that you don't like this

Adidas 1's in da club
(Okay, okay thug what, what)

[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Adidas 1's in da club

Who woulda thought I'd have to pop a trunk

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Air Force 1's on my feet
I ride a Chevy (?) the freaks
Yo I can't stop stop cause my clique still with me
Life is twirl my rims is still spinning
Increase my goal and pop my collar
Bad bitches talking in the club with they Prada
Open my trunk with a lame if I gotta
Show em how quickly a comedy turn to drama
Blaze dead bull for saying shit outta line
Something like (?) a lame get outta time

Don't [?] I used to buy them shells when I (?)
I bust, boy you talkin' shit then don't play around us
My niggas'll split your wig
Uh, uh, ya dig?
My crew like what it do
Air 1's on my toes in the club when I roll through

[Hook: Big Kriz Kaliko]

[Verse 2: Big Kriz Kaliko]
Now bigger straps than forces are shell-toed Adidas
Can tell who it is by the way we rob people
We headed to the club to see what we can snuff out
But first we head to the spot so we can get totally drilled out
There's no doubt that the boys from down south
Take a look at the kids they taking what I dream about, sex
Now what you think that I came here for?
To buy (?) for my Adidas? No!

In the (?) of the room on the flow, in them nice kicks
Drinking that lady pipe, don't say that you don't like this

Adidas 1's in the club
Adidas 1's, who woulda thought
Who-who, woulda thought I'd have to pop a trunk

[Hook: Big Kriz Kaliko]Chorus (Raj Chrome)
All of my Life
Roll another backwoods lemme get this off of my chest
All of my life
Runnin' through my old hood, even when I'm down I feel blessed
All of my life
King without a crown but I'm gunning everybody else down
All of my life
Look up to the sky
Got the power in my eyes
And I'm shinin' all of my life[Intro]
An A&R once told me
“You can determine the worth of a song within 15 seconds of it playing”
With complete and utter lack of the fact
That it takes takes all 3 minutes and 40 seconds of a song
To comprehend what I’m saying
It ain't a single if it don’t fly
It ain't a hit if it don’t ride
Now he couldn’t tell me the components of a smash
But the ringtones were their all-time high
And a rappers only as big as his chain, the flashier the better

[Hook]
They say "money make the world go round"
You never lost til you lose your crown
And they don’t love you till you’re under ground
Or when you’re maxing out your bank account
Yeah, you do it all just to live the life
Even if it means you don’t live it right
And even if it means you don’t survive the night
But if even if you do you won’t survive the hype
Of an American rapstar

[Verse 1 - Big K.R.I.T]
Push it to the limit (Why?)
Just to get up high with a wood grain kitted?
Ride around town like I never lived in it
Gun in my dash, pray I never kill with it
I’m that real with it
Got my eyes on the prize
Bills still due, motherfuck 9-5
Searching for a freak that wanna fuck once or twice
Wanna buy a bottle but I ain't paid my tithes
This ain't no lie, I got a vision and a masterplan
To hit the block and blow up like a Taliban
I make it where the plane never have to land
I make it where them lames never stand a chance
Shit, you’ll never know, only time’ll tell
You either starve or you find the scale
You either buying or you tryna' sell
You either fall or you grind the rails

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big K.R.I.T]
So watch me get it how I live
Waiting on my moment, screaming fuck how they feel
Dodging jail cells and them pigs down to kill
They shot Oscar Grant swear it gave a nigga chills
Lets keep it real, if you ain't looking keep your eyes closed
Will I pay what I owe? Only God knows
I ain't for sure, give me strength just to change what I can’t
And understand the difference between a nigga and the King that I am
Gotta keep ya finger on the trigger
Pac died, Biggie died, they ain't found a killer
Momma say she worried ’cause I rap about the Government
And how the Church caked other people out there struggling (its real though)
I just call it how it is, folk
I’m breathing for a reason, what you here for?
They got it where the villains who we cheer for
Cause they murdered all the heroes

[Hook][Intro]
Now won't you chucka chucka chucka chucka chucka? (X4)

[Verse 1]
I know you hear this train coming rumbling down the track
Don’t miss out on this pimpin shawty, it ain't coming back
I'm steamrolling no controllin', while I whippin'
Smoke stacking, seal cracking while I'm switching
Gears. It makes it hard to hear with 15s in the caboose
I'm more southern than Norfolk bitch that's why they love what I do
Caution, danger, when I'm on my shit there ain’t no slowing down
Picking up the loners that's horny whenever I am in town
Them yellowbellies, them, them, them coco browns
They love to give me that, that chu chu chu chu sound
I toot my horn to all them haters bumpin, bumpin

[Pre-hook]
Cause I know they hear this train coming
Yeah, bitch I know you hear this train coming, aha

[Hook]
You know you want to ride on my locomotive
And I bleed the brakes off the train till you can't control it
Now won't you chucka chucka chucka chucka chew it? (X4)

[Verse 2]
I know you hear this train coming you best grab your bags
Don’t worry about your partners and them just bring your ass
Now let me break it down (down) before we go
Don’t hold back what the good lord gave you, let it show
Now all aboard for all of those that claim they down to get it
I advise you to exit right now if you ain't down with it
Really, I am just trying to free your mind from this prison
I show you how to get out if you just listen
You’ll never want to leave ya if you just visit
This ain’t no more cars coming calling the time is ticking
Your homegirl just aight, I'm kind of picky
But you a booming business, I hope she got a ticket

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let me see your ticket
Where you tryna go down? Hmmm I dont think this gon' get you there. Yeah I can take you though. If you really wana go there
You gotta be just my type, shawty... Because[Hook:]
I think angels get high
Cause I can't describe all these clouds in the sky
I think God must have cried
Cause I can't describe all this rain in my life
I think angels get high

[Verse 1:]
When the sun goes down, heroes don't come outside
I seen too many villains provide
How can I choose a side to be on?
Tell a junkie be gone
Cause I don't push what he on or she on
Like before
Sometimes it's hard to pay the debt that you owe
Too much of something good will have you strung on the floor
Thunderstorms forever form outside my home
I swear these angels taking bong hits
I wonder if that flood that came through just because that left us on the curb was one of God's tears
To wash away the pain that we had
The house wasn't much, the neighborhood was bad
The basement won't save us but the prayers get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Standing on the roof while helicopters swoop by
I think they don't see us
Not even FEMA could redeem the very faith we all lost
That made us once believers
Natural disasters bring us closer
My partner never prayed until he thought the world was over
2012, December 1st, he called me in a panic
He heard a storm was coming and it might destroy the planet, dammit
I called him back tomorrow because the boat I been paddling can't deal with so much sorrow
Borrowed time wasted
I probably shoulda played it safe instead of storm chasing
But the prayers will get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

[Hook:][Verse: Big KRIT]
Cold sweats cover my forehead
Another dream of angels wings and horsemen, damn
I guess it was the liquor and the weed
That made me toss and turn in my sleep
Eyes wide open, shakin' off the omen
Of the things to come, no escapin' what approachin'
The calm before the storm, soft feet and itchy palms
Things we do for green make you wish you wasn't born
Time never waits for no man
Even a slow hand can catch his predecessor
Don't pick it, let it fester
The anger makes me better
Down to do whatever when it's needed
My heart (?) away, most days I leave it
I'm eager to hit a lick, make it flip, make some some chips, call a play
Phone God, times is hard, tell 'em that I'm on my way
Prayin' for forgiveness for my sins
While some sell their soul for a Benz
It ends now, what makes me better than the rest
I guess it's cause I say so, like need I say more?
Why stop when they can't keep up?
The thrills and the kill it ain't shit to beat ya
Fuck you and your feature
The R&B singers on the choruses is why your song was a hit
Whack ass rappers suck a dick and die slow
I'm the only King Remembered In Time that you know
They never thought I'd grow up to be a beast on beats
Fix my plate, let's feast on MC's
From corners of the streets to clean (?) overseas
No book could speak to me like C.R.E.A.M. and Melodies
Whippin' up beats, but rappin's my specialty
I mastered both and ruled the game effectively
Pioneer
It was written that my time is near
No need to wait because he is I, and I am here
Krizzle

[Outro:] x5
The Angels callin'[Intro]
I want you all to go to your windows
Go to your windows and yell out
Scream with all the life that you can muster up inside your bruised, assaulted and battered bodies:
"I am sick and tired of being a nigga!"

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

[Verse 1]
Waitin' with my hands out
Broke in the hood, they give a damn 'bout
Braggin' to my homies 'bout the hoes I fucked
Drinkin' bottles after bottle, plus I smoke too much
I never had a job that would pay me well
I took what I could cause they gave me hell
Spend what I stole on some clothes and kicks
My ex-girl say I won't amount to shit
But she suck and fuck when my car roll up
Tried to fuck her sister but she talk too much
Her mama shake her head whenever I come 'round
Whatever high I had when I saw her might come down
I barely go to church but I say I will
I bow my head right before I eat my meal
The world's fucked up and they claimin' I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

[Verse 2]
Waitin' on a play to come through
Chillin' with my homeboys plottin' on you
Watchin' movies how to come up quick
Recruiting young niggas I can come up with
Barely read books, but they down to shoot
Live life breaking rules, they got something to prove
Parents ain't around they got nothing to lose
Wave the tool on a fool for some brand new shoes
Little child runnin' wild in the streets
Wanna be a G so he look up to me
Try to hit the block and make a name
Claim he caught a body now he got it and he feeling all the same
Till the family of the victim come knocking
Bailing through the corners of the ghetto till they shot him
Youth still dyin' and they claimin' I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

[Verse 3]
Always trying to sell you something
Don't really know shit, but trying to tell you something
Tap dance if you want him to
Coulda' fed the hungry but he bought them jewels
Won't ever look back cause he gotta keep movin'
Even if he leave his own people Bamboozled
Takin' credit like he did it by himself
Too much pride to realize that he really had help
Only judge a man by his wealth
He ain't me so he can't feel how I felt
He saw me walkin' and he ain't look back - too scared
We make eye contact:
So he can say he didn't see me when he drove by
And I could say he didn't see me and it's alright
He just want the fame from the game, it's a shame
I bet he think I'm just another nigga

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga[Intro]
See, I was made in my father's image and they belittle my deeds
Their lust for convictions pledge allegiance to the almighty power and greed
See seeds born, withered parents, still children, adolescent in their ways
Some preachers false prophets educated pigeon droppers using our sins to get paid
Slaves; give them freedom but give them dope
Take away their leader, 'cause that give them hope
Sell them dreams of changing things like they were never kings and queens before
As small as a giant

[Hook]
As small as a giant, I'm still ridin'
Hand on my sword good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done until my eyes closed
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant

[Verse 1]
The beginning was kinda dark, not too soft fairly hard
Drenched with love from my mother, connected to her struggle
Till she cut me loose, now what shall I do?
It was oh-so-easy, look at how they treat me
Ever since she pushed me through
Now put me back in and stop these contractions
Water breaking, aw damn I know it's bout to happen
Failed to fix, no picket fence, a dream deferred
Beer and liquor chillin' with my niggas swishas and herb
Eviction notices, hopelessness thrown on my shoulders
God won't give you more than you can handle
Carry these boulders, give it all I got until I get older
Couple medals on my sleeves cause life made me a soldier
Reminisce on how it was way back when
But some things were better off way back then
As small as a giant, a promise so divided
Probably ain't surprised in so long
Since we sung such over Lord's camp fires
Cosby's was cool but television is a lie
Some reason I relate to survivor
Fresh Prince but no Uncle Phil
The Carltons that I knew never stayed where we lived
Couldn't play with those kids
When they were reading books
We were playing cops and crooks
When they was writing essays, I was writing hooks
Mama I'll be that nigga on TV
'Cause people like Bow Wow and Soulja Boy make it look easy
No Pun intended, hoping they get offended
I'm throwing up if these niggas spittin'
Didn't write it but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant but my bloodline is of kings
Knight in shinning armor for this rap shit, I slash quick
Far as a man spit leaving gashes on these industry bastards
They can't see what is real, don't know how I feel
They weren't raised where I live
In Mississippi

[Hook]
As small as a giant, I'm still ridin'
Hand on my sword good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done until my eyes closed
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant

[Verse 2]
Rise and shine, no time for sleep, thinking bout eating
Leaving this place long gone
I get no service on this earth I need to phone home
Did too much dirt to talk to God, nowadays I get the dial tone
Try again tomorrow, my heart filled with sorrow
My family broke too so why bother try trying to borrow
No car, no house, drug dealing
Feeling like it might be my only option to get millions
What else could I do? Put yourself in my shoes
If you had no whip you'd take some shortcuts too
Their ain't no time to be wasted, the world is going under
Nowadays can't tell fall from spring and winter from summer
I wonder if this was meant to be
Maybe all the bullshit was meant for me, takes a lot of energy
Break these chains and erase these thangs
Society put up on our brain
How could I explain it, we ain't free yet
Obama cool but he ain't sending me no free checks
They killing all my niggas Lord forbid I'll be next
No now, got too many sorrows to say and
Kisses to give, they don't feel how I feel
They weren't raised where I live
In Mississippi

[Hook]
As small as a giant, I'm still ridin'
Hand on my sword good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done until my eyes closed
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant[Intro]
Yeah, just pass the aux cord man
Yeah, just pass the aux cord
Heh, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm just tryna play that fly shit, Sly Family Stone ride shit
Even if you don't smoke, get high shit
Laid back like this that, this that, this that vibe
Finally got off work like this that, this that ride
To vacation, across 110th Street was blazing
For the motherless children that related to Mahalia
I know, you tired of that you can't feel it in your heart
Let the music be your secret lover like Atlantic Starr
New Birth, Wildflower was that jamming shit by far
And Eddie Kendricks' voice will have you singing in your car
I know, I know, I know Marvin played at your home
But that's the reason why your parents had to get it on
That's the reason why you're probably here anyway
Don't fret, you can play that bullshit any day
But, I'm just saying it's a whole catalog
Of analog, the warmer sounds you've ever saw
Pass the aux cord

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Instant Vintage, might as well, that Raphael Saadiq, yeah
Voodoo moved your soul, Cruisin' was made for L-U-V-ing
Badu food for thought, eat out her Appletree and
Jill Scott forever golden, R.I.P. B.B. King
Prince and MJ that we played, barbecue to death
Summer shine, summertime, Will Smith and Jazzy Jeff
Willie Hutch scored the mack while Foxy Brown was slept
Billy Paul, Me and Ms. Jones, I always knew she crept
Barry White, Love Unlimited for the Soul Brothers
Ohio players and heat wave for the Cole Brothers
Funkadelic, Minnie Riper through the speakers
Bill Withers, Johnnie Taylor, cheaper just to keep her
David Ruffin and The Temptations
Christmas time, Silent Night, Gladys Midnight Train kept the Pips waitin'
I'm saying, we can go and chill on that other shit
And join the Parliament, mothership
With this aux chord

[Outro: Nikki Greer]
Music on another level
Let this eargasm take you to Heaven
And get you high
Waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
You're waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
Keep waking me up[Intro: DJ Dibia$e]
The kings is back, mayne
We back for SXSW 2015
We took 2014 off but we back, mayne
B4SXSW...

[Verse: Big KRIT (voice screwed)]
Still waiting on my just due
Candy paint, got it oak blue
On the outside looking inside...
At these non-believers hollering, "fuck you!"
Cause they ain't playa, barely paid
Working 9-5 just to scrape some change
While I was flexin' chrome, with a yellow bone
With a fat ass, [?] face
Slid in the pussy like a cross fader
And jigged in it like all day
No love lost, my team floss
We gon' break 'em off, 'til we all paid
And that's word to Steve-O, [?]
Big Sant and Smoke DZA
Multi til' the sun die
Fuck if you don really fuck with it
That fake love don't mean shit
Talking about we been partners
Matter of fact you ain't got to spin my records
I sell out shows and make [?]
And it make sense, fuck what you heard
[?]
I kill songs 'til the beats gone
And hold a memorial service like right after
Another chapter, another topic
Your personality is so out of pocket
My bank account like, "I'm too full."
Your bank account like, "You need to stop it."
It's just a hobby, you ain't getting bread
Just a dream if there's no cream
You wake up starving
I wake up calling
For a bitch to feed me like Akeem
Watching Pain in Full on 5 screens
Franchise with like 5 rings
Dope enough to kill 5 fiends
And you done played along for 5 teens
And that’s on the real
Show my grill
Pop my trunk and one finger whip
Bangin' Screw like, "What it do?"
A Mississippi Pimp with some Texas shiiit!
Believe that there
Make it where a bad bitch need that there
Fuck the world and bust a nut in her
And tell that bitch she can see that there
On the front of Forbes, gonna' G' that there
And that broke shit I had to leave that there
Hit the lot with my old school
But that funk, I need that there
That's no lie, I got to feed the fam'
I do it for the south
You do it for the gram
We ain't the same so I understand
If you fall off
And are never seen again
And that's tough luck but thats how it be
My trunk banging at ‘em with Sicily
I swear if aliens came down with fleets
It’s cause my subwoofer phoned E.T
The boy sounding like a space modulator
Innovator so they had to see
I'm knocking pictures off the wall at the white house
My neon shining with the lights out
We got to fuck, get my dick sucked
Tell her suck slow and don’t bite down
Too exclusive, too vicious
I bought a three story like this ain't expensive
[?] doing hella shows
I couldn’t hit the gym, I was on the road
Didn’t lift weights
Eatin' made steak
But impressive bands kept my pockets swoll'
Tell her bust it open like the optimo
Watching out for these jealous snakes
Cause niggas slither
When you’re clocking figures
[?]
Like a two year old
When I’m throwing cake
Grab a hand full
And mush it in your face, bitch
I'm still clocking figures
Working wheels like 9 to 5
Chopping these blades everyday...

[Outro: DJ Dibia$e]
Hey we got the soundcheck for you right here...
Before SXSW 2015
The mixtape
DJ Dibia$e, the million dollar DJ
I’m back, mayne
You know I been wrecking SXSW for like 5-6 years now
You know what I mean?
I took last year off
But real niggas had to come back
We had show up and show out[Hook]
Yeah shawty I know I made some mistakes
To get ya back I do whatever it takes
Yeah shawty I know I made some mistakes
To get ya back I do whatever it takes
Don't do it, don't give a nigga up like that
Don't do it, don't give a nigga up like that
I was gon' get right back
I was gon' get right back

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong I hurt your heart and I apologize
Wish I was [?] cuz I can see with no other guy
I wouldn't have left them other hoes alone if I didn't care
Last night I came home and you wan't there
I blame myself for all the tears that you cry shawty
I did this music cuz I knew that you would ride shawty
We talked all about the tour dates and pre-shows
You said you wouldn't be concerned with all them groupie hoes
But then you start trippin' fighting with me actin' funny paranoid thinkin that you seen me with another woman
I though you didn't trust me so I made a grave mistake
I met up with a shawty that I knew around the way
But now it's too late, yeah and the damage done
The weight [?] do you wrong is on my shoulders and it weighs a ton
But I can't take it back but what we had I can't lose it
I'm crying out just like this track baby don't do it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I tried my best did my best wasn't good enough
3 years shawty why the hell you givin' up
You're mamma told me that you cry 'bout it every night
Friends remind me when they see me that I wasn't right
You never miss something good till it's gone
Without you in my life girl this house ain't a home
This music ain't in me and the money ain't worth it
When it was me and you we were oh so perfect
Ay this is real, this is now, this is how i'm feeling
No worries, just chilling thats how we be living
But now the shits twisted
And yee ain't gettin' back
I threw away what we had but I can get it back
And all you need is time
And imma be around
I'm only human and I'm sorry that I let you down
But I can't take it back, but what we had I can't lose it
I'm crying out just like this track baby don't do it

[Hook][Hook]
I can't believe I took it this far, this time
I told myself, I should be smart and not blind
Bang, bang, bang, down we went today
Lord, I think there's something wrong
Bang, bang, bang, another bullet went astray
Another soul dead and gone

[Verse 1]
I heard a gun the other day
It spoke to me and told me power
Was the only thing that we could lose
So don't be afraid to let it shower
On them, if they ever run up at my door
It came with a red dot, for sure shot, and a silencer on the low
I had to stop and pause and think about it
While it gave me its resume
Told me no better way to protect myself
In this world we live in
Cause they killing up women and children
Ain't nothing like having one on hand
Cause if you draw down first you'll be the man
Then you'll pop your trunk and demand
That respect, if they neglect, in the club
When they touched my queen they didn't know what we had was love
And it'll never be the same cause you'll throw it in my face just because
So I'll pop my trunk once again
For her heart I'll defend
And I'll let it rain on them, The Banana clip theory

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I heard he just killed a man, I think he was a father, I know he was a brother
Because his sis said that, they gon' retaliate tomorrow
The doors still revolvin; gun shop
You looking for the kinda clip that don't stop
Cause you heard the jack boys coming for the very spot
That you opened up on they block
They wore red but you bang blue, they drove by but they ain't shoot
Till you was outside with the whole fam, havin' brews, talkin shit, eatin' barbeque
Duck and dodge, but it ain't safe, you hit the corner but they gave chase
And double back cause you got away
But your little cousin got hit
Sleepin in his baby crib
No CPR cause it's too late
So you cry, but you bounce back
Your reply is to get the gat
It's an eye for an eye till it's jet black
The only way you'll survive in your mind is to stay strapped
So you act out
They'll call you soft if you back out
So you roll your window down and you black out
They next day they'll be back 'round
The Banana Clip Theory

[Hook][Hook]
All I need is God, couple mil' and a porterhouse
All these niggas' paper soldiers cardboard, cut 'em out
I remember when I ain't had shit
Mama said don't touch nothing, now I'm on some grab shit
Murder everything on some stab shit
Bystanders, getting head and power up
Motherfucking highlander
Been a while, since I let these niggas ramble
All I hear is Mt. Olympus banging out the band door

[Verse]
You ain't said shit 'til you said it to me
You payin' for the pussy shawty said it was free
Now I ain't got time for the fake ones
All I talk about cake motherfucker go and bake one
We was on some shit back in nine-nine
You was suckin' on ya' mama's titties hollering bout the toy mine
Bottom line, I was on the grind all around town
Country bumpkin southern motherfucker in surround sound, Yes!
I flexed and I paid dues
Kicked a couple doors that they said I couldn't break through
I remember starving on the real, nigga
Now I got steak on the grill, nigga
Saute shrimp, lemon peel let it chill, nigga
Nah, you can't eat cause it's keep what you kill, nigga
Rolling down the strip like I never made it
Peepin' all the broke motherfuckers keep me motivated
Pop that ass for a player, don't be scared of the dick
Find a drink and some gators for a pimp
I ain't playin' with these hoes
Bad bitches super fly, super (?) with these hoes like a pimp[Hook:]
I just wanna see, I just wanna see, I just wanna see
The best side of me, the best side of me, the best side of me
It's just so easy to be, I'm just so easy to be
A motherfucking P-I-M-P
I know it's hard on you shawdy, hey, I know it's hard on you shawdy

[Verse 1:]
Hey, I met ya on a bright summer day and it was cool
I thought you was fly and you thought I was rude
And you had you a dude, but he wasn't around
You liked a nigga's swag so you wrote your number down
We jumped our friendship off right
On the phone all day and all night
You told me you was feeling me, digging me
Seeing a connection with our signs and our energy
Askin' if I ever hurt a girl and if I would
I told you I never, ever cheat if I could
I could tell you was down, not the type just to cut
Yea, your boyfriend cheated cause you wouldn't give it up
Now I know you was testing me, seeing if I'm playin'
When you ask me 'bout marriage, I know just what you're sayin'
I'm cool with the choices and decisions that you make
I feel ya, so shawdy, hell yea I can wait
But baby girl

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Now I ain't really trippin' when you going through my clothes, and you seeing all these numbers in my phone
And you ain't go to trippin' when I left the after party and I told you that I wasn't comin' home
Hey, now I don't go to trippin' when you talkin' to your girls, have them follow me around like a witness
Now she blowin' up my phone, she ain't never kept a nigga, puttin' her 2 cent all in our business
But I can see your concern cause I ain't actin' like I used to
I don't wanna talk cause I knowin' I confuse you
Love you baby girl but I don't think that I can budge
Ya ask me if I like it every time you see a tux
Your momma think I'm nice but your daddy hate my guts
I only care for you, so I don't really give a fuck
Some days I can stay, some days I can leave
I think you a blessin' from God
But baby girl

[Hook:][Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got big bank flexing on a mothafucka
Ain't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine
Ain't no love for a hater try'na block me, tryna play me
Mothafuckas never stop my, stop shine
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I was one deep, creepin'
Caddy on high, my paint never dry
Forgiato, the women, and tires squeaking
Where niggas will never get by
Flipping the script on the hoes
Shine up the grill in these glows
Paper dip but never show
'Til the fucking lot was super throwed
Players out'chea on game
Pimpin' so cold on the hoes on the two below
That we can put out the flame
Of the blue hand of the roof of the coupe
All I got is bands man, who got the change?
Who got the number to the nearest burger diner?
The club can chirp 'fore the clip hit the pole
And do a split, cause we bought wings
We ain't talking about flights
Talking lemon pepper vodka with the ice
Spent more on Js than the steak and the shrimp
Than mo' gon' make in they in life
Ain't tripped up, never hiccup from the drank
Pick up where I left off on the dank
Flexed out, never stressed out over chains
Stretched out, get pressed out on the grain
Woof! You hear that there
I make it where these mothafuckas feel that there
When the rims too big and the road ain't shit
It make it hard to steer that there
But it's big bank, big bank, big bank, big bank, one time
I wake up, cake up, cake up, then press, rewind

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got big bank flexing on a mothafucka
Ain't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine
Ain't no love for a hater try'na block me, tryna play me
Mothafuckas never stop my, stop shine
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Big bank, currency, and revenue
Getting to it, all a nigga ever do
And all I care about is how to get it, no doubt
Big numbers in front of my decimal, check it
Make sure it's multiplying
Is all I'm ever I worried about
And slow money beat no money
What the fuck you in a hurry 'bout?
Nigga, I'm saying, mm
Stay getting to it that broke shit ain't in my plan, yeah
Sleep when I'm dead, I'ma grind every day that I can
Got seven kids, and I gotta make sure
All of 'em them fed, by any means
Can't be no excuses, my children can't eat no excuses
My daughter can't sleep in excuses
My son he see me with no paper like keep your excuses
If you ain't producing, you're useless
That's why I'm out here getting to it
Fresh out the booth, I go straight to the stage
Then I go straight to get paid
Hunnid' I earned, fifty I saved
My bitch don't be cleaning up, I need a maid
She don't be cooking so I need a chef
Ain't giving me nothin', I get it myself
I'm doing my thing and I did it to death
Stacking them chips, getting that dough
Millions, need me a couple hundo
Big mansion with a double front do'
Pretty young thang in a new condo
Pray to God I could stay rich and stay humble

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got big bank flexing on a mothafucka
Ain't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine
Ain't no love for a hater try'na block me, tryna play me
Mothafuckas never stop my, stop shine
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Earthlings and aliens, gather around, come close
While I tell you the story of fine ass Denise
And the 4 15s in a Caprice
Hitting hard like a disrespectful step-daddy
The thunder god coming up the block
Going subbing is a way of life
Hugged up with yo' baby mama or your wife
Ride on, sub on[Hook:]
(It's a Big Boi thang)
Super fresh get paid for my rhymes
I only say what's on my mind
(It's a Big Boi thang)
Turning heads hoes choosin' in the instant pimp game
So persistent we grind
(It's a Big Boi thang)
Shawty please I'm a (?) what you expect
From the (?) to the rocks on my neck
(It's a Big Boi thang)
Jump out the coupe equipped with the angel wings on
Run like Bibby from the Kings
(It's a Big Boi thang)

[Verse 1:]
Takin' shots like they never woulda thought I'd make it
I hit the block (?) the bumper and I crack the pavement
(?) hard as I fire up like Donald Trump
Fuck a gorilla, I got a whole zoo in my trunk
Got my lady right beside me, call her Nina Ross
Keep her alibi in case she break a nigga off
Cruise the city limits (?) coupe (?) makin' heads turn
Then hit the mall just in time to catch a yellow bird
Tossin' lames, I got (?) cause I got block to smash
Keep my hands free at all times cause I got hoes to grab
Don't get it twisted, money never changed KRIT
I still press a lame shit quick like the local cleaners
And bust a Pacer nigga head like Ben Wallace
Hey this that blueprint shawty, ya'll just (?)
I stick to the playa shit cause that's what gets me paid
So fuck what these niggas say

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Young Krizzle from the bottom of the map
I got the streets on lock and some G's on (?)
Some hoes don't track since the dough won't trap
(?) grills on 'Lacs what you know 'bout that
Get a deal and a mil then I cop that coupe
Spray the outsides silver get the inside's blue
Them hoes gone do when I get them shoes
I'm a God in my flow you can call me Zeus
Don't get offended by my image cause I'm gettin' women
Somethin' like a soccer ball how a nigga kick it pimpin'
VH1 flow shit's so driven
Can't take my shine, ain't shit here given
Violate me and you seein' some things
Pop trunk on a hater if you need some things
Cause niggas talk a lot and never really be about it
All I gotta do is point ya out, nigga see about it

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Top down hittin' sixty in the inner city
We're switchin' lanes, grippin' grain, they ain't fuckin' with me
Hoes choosin', boppers boppin'
Money comin' in, choppers choppin'
I got that normal white T fitted cap on
Airforces on my feet talkin' 'bout the strap-ons
Real niggas know they ain't gotta front
Plus these hoes know I'm paid so I ain't even gotta stunt
And when I crawl out the haters like aww nah
Mad cause I'm sittin' sideways like Paul Wall
I'm from the backwoods and they gone love me
These haters treat me like Chevies cause they wanna dub me
I'm so gutter nigga, respect my mind frame
I run this mixtape shit, respect my grind man
I'm shuttin' cities down, I'm tearin' clubs up
Hey I'm the hottest thing out, you can ask Buck

[Hook:][Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Krizzle he a new breed
Life is like a movie
All the new comers like who he? who me?
Just a nigga straight up out the gutta
With the skill that make a new yorker wanna be southern
Streets lights tell the stories of the real niggas
Pardon me if half of the time I never feel niggas
Like honestly how the fuck you get a deal nigga?
I guess once I get on I'm gonna have to kill niggas
Lord I was trying not to push it to the ledge
The grind ain't sturdy and we hanging on the edge
Mississippi got next
You heard what I said?
And I'll still out rap some of the best when I'm dead
Check my cred killer is a vet
I'm talking about bars I ain't talking about pets
When I get green like gumby I stretch
A pair of J's out the case
I'm that fresh, yes
Give me any beat
And I'll kill it like it's living
I only do me it's fuck how they feeling
That green that I'm toting got me higher than the ceiling
The whip color sunny d nigga I'm orange peeling
Street life chilling niggas can't touch me
Car without an engine, bitch you can't budge me
Heard the lames hate me and they baby mommas love me
If they didn't handcuff em at my show
They'd probably fuck me
I'm a little crazy
I'm a little off though
Put you on display in the day like a car show
Toss you in the trunk
And drive away with the cargo
All I see is snow bunnies
Call me Donnie Darko
Grill look mean on the whip
It's a gargoyle
This the shit niggas in the hood
Sell hard for
A fine crib and a lambo marcielago
A1 credit and the next top model
But you know niggas
Think they guns can stop 4 niggas
Claim they hard as hell
But really ho niggas
Slow niggas never get paid
Gold diggers get played
And lame niggas never get laid
Unless they throwing fetti
At a chick they call me daddy
She bring me all the money
Because she know that make me happy
Go out and break her back
Just to keep a nigga flashing
And see me on top
She thought it was a classic
I'm a nervous wreck
On the mic
I keep spazzing
Married to my money
And she having contractions
Gave birth to money
With no lamaze classes
My toddler dig the new line
Of rubberband fashion[Intro:]
I like this beat
I mean it's just a loop and all
But, fuck it I'mma spit anyway
Buck, I'm just gonna spazz on these niggas real quick

Now still I'd rap some of the best when I'm dead
Check my cred, killer is a fact

When I get green like Gumby, I stretch
A pair of J's out the case, yea I'm that fresh
Yes, give me any beat and I kill it like it's livin'
I only do me, cause fuck how they feelin'
That green that I'm tottin' got me higher than the ceilin'
The whip color Sunny-D nigga, I'm orange peelin'
Streetlight chillin', niggas can't touch me

Chill[Intro]
I'll paint all the world for you baby
I'll paint all the world for you
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I'll paint all the world for you baby
(I'll paint all the world for you)

[Chorus]
Yeah
I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

[Verse 1]
I call your phone
You don't pick up, you text me
Too late to come back you say my art ain't even half the way it used to look
The colors that I chose to compose my last masterpiece wasn't worth the cover of a book
I listen as you rant on 'bout Rembrandts and Van Goghs
That, I used to show you was so pure at heart
Now all the pictures that I draw lately perfect my need to be basic and all the shading tears your world apart
Pollock I promise you say it's scribble and scratch
I know you don't mean it cause on your wall's where it sat
It's not my best I agree but I did what I could
With these sticks and these stones to get us out of the woods
I find my rhythm and and my stroke then you fall in love with my art like you did before
On that note I let go and tend to my canvas to paint a mural of us
I hope that you understand the bigger picture

[Chorus]
Yeah
I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

[Verse 2]
Back to my roots
Channel my youth
You love the color of yellow but I'm working with blue
Like what's the use of doing art if I ain't breaking the rules
My graffiti wasn't Banksy but you thought it was cool
It used to be fun to watch me do what it do
But when the paint started drying I stopped running to you
I started walking away cause I could paint any day
One line from being complete
I'm sorry I made you wait to get a crown and some space
I thought you'd be a great painter
Cause you could see the good in me in all the angles
A radiant child we could've had
And those clowns in your past you paint, just make you laugh
All because, that self portrait that I put on display should've been of us
I left you out and I was wrong
I promise I'll start over if you come back home

[Chorus]
Yeah
I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

[Bridge]
I'll paint the sky blue
I'll paint the grass green
I'll paint the roses red
And everything in between
I'll paint the sky blue
I'll paint the grass green
I'll paint the roses red
And everything in between

[Chorus]
Yeah
I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture[Hook:]

Yeah, my creator gave me the gift to create
In this mind of mine apply to our escape
In an atmosphere that wouldn't hold our weight
If I leave from here, I'll call when I'm safe
Knocking on the door, hoping someone answers
Yeah, I call that faith
This mouth of mine has turned down water for wine
I still recall that taste of bittersweet
Like when I realize you'll never be as perfect as the one that invented me
And a world full of temptations can make you feel so incomplete
Grew up to better than me, go farther than I can go
See farther than I can see
When my days draw to a close, breathe longer than I can breathe
And I'm fine with that
In the event I decide to move forward what you've done
They can rewind it back
And I'm a proud parent now as I was a proud parent then
I saw you grow up to become the kind of king that I knew you'd always been
Indeed, there's a finish line for me, but for you, there's no end
So, perhaps all that work that has been done was a win
And although my intentions were for good, it still brung us to a sin
But I'll pay for your mistakes as long as this world continues to spin
As this vessel of mine breaks down, I know you have never been
I'm sure as Multi is your home, hard times will come again
I set aside a book of rhymes that'll pave the way for now and then
I know forever is a mighty long time—so where should we begin?

[Verse 2]
—On the Southside 'cause I'm a country bumpkin, bumpin' out the system, fuck if they don't listen
We done came a long way from niggas throwing CDs out the window like I made a frisbee
Better than veteran rapper's favorite rappers
Conscious or trappers and I'm Mississippi
Dirty Southern mothafucka kicking
Like a red bucket with white top chitlins
Shittin' on niggas, my rhyme flow
Hands-'hind-back, eyes blind fold
Mind, body, and soul connected to the Most High
Even when times got low
Uhh, look how they hate me, but copy me
Possibly I was the one with components and properties
To be the greatest of all time, but you won geography lottery
So I keep kicking, flipping tables, chosen and favored
Fuck being major when giant is greater
Fortune and fame but you fuck for the label
Truth is what made me
Settle down, settle down, I was angry but I'm better now
Niggas talking raising bars, mine amongst the stars
Give it time to level out
If you worried about the flow, I'll make a beat
Write you a hook that you repeat
Even go as far to drop a mixtape that you re-do
Never credit me, separately sold
Slick as the Giuseppe on slippery floors
Mop by the buckets that I used to hold
While dreaming of plaques and selling out shows
Multi-alumni forever the fours[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
Mommas been cryin' and they gon' keep cryin'
Black folk been dyin' and they gon' keep dyin'
Police been firin' and they gon' keep firin'
The government been lyin' and they gon' keep lyin'
Propaganda news channels, that shit is all for show
Camera phone videos is like all we know
Diluting what an eye witness might really say
Because the whole world saw a murder yesterday
Now your account ain't what it used to be
According to them your eyes can't adjust to the violence you ain't used to see
Police brutality is all in your mind
And the tactics that they use only look worse in rewind
And people die everyday, you should get used to it
Hands behind yo' back, face down, and still say you shootin'
Can't breathe
Knee where your neck be like why you movin'?
Kids in your car, headed home like what you doin'?
Like why you chillin'? Fuck yo' feelin's
Why you smilin' when I'm so serious?
I hate patrolling your space, like why you livin'?
Stop asking questions, why you filmin'?
You look suspicious, I think you dealin'
Step out the car, fit the description
Someone I fear, I need to kill it
Blood on the curb, I need it spillin’
'Nother civilian, 'nother not guilty
'Nother T-shirt, 'nother rap lyric
'Nother life gone, I can't forgive it[Intro: Big KRIT]
Yeah
Yeah
Young Krizzle
Third coast
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I woke up like "fuck these niggas man I gotta get mine"
You a hater by all means, there go a line
Ain't no need for new friends or these bickering hoes
'Cus wasn't none of y'all around when I was over the stove
You thinkin' bout dope, I'm thinking too cold
Fingertip froze, I been through the most
Look how it shows, look at these shows
I got to the highs for seeing the lows
You sayin' I changed but really it's growth
Fuck what you know if you ain't a game changer
Ol' commentatin' ass niggas all talk but ain't playin' never
Balled out the bleachers, you get shook if you reachin'
Bought a crib and whip off a beat and a feature
When you finally get this money you see just how they treat ya
When you get it out the mud you come up with some leeches
Never mind that, soon as I left Def Jam I got my shine back
I know they were lookin' at Sha like "why you sign that?"
All the while I was killin' like "go out rhyme that"
They claim they gave me a chance but I can't find that
Fuck it, lesson learned I earned the knowledge
The game's an open road and I needed the mileage
I'm fit for this here ain't no need for a stylist
I know that I'm better but really you bias
'cus you from the same city
As your favorite rapper favorite rapper, I can dig it
And you ain't tryin' to go to Meridian, Mississippi
And kick it, it's cool I spit that country shit worldwide
Let my accent be the reason for the wetness 'tween your girl's thighs
Foreign cars, Forgiato tires, top circumcised
Funny how niggas counted me out but I still multiplied
My worth, maximized that purse
Goyard or Hermes, whichever she want first
The only way I fall off, if there's no gravity on Earth
And even then I'm still amongst the stars
Better that than a game that trades genius for sub-par
Lifestyle for bars, if you didn't have that vouch would you have made it this far?
Imagine my shock when niggas come at my spot
That control shit was cool, but nigga look what I got
Mt. Olympus overlooked, barely spinning, game is rigged
It ain't no winnin' without no budget or no label, shout out to Sway
'Cus at least he'll bring up the fact that I still paved the way
When a lot of them wish radio was "fuck I had something to say"
Not popular though, not popular music
I pray and give thanks, they don't like how I'm moving
But every time I drop a tape they like "peep what he doing"
Then we package it all like I'm the first one to do it
Damn shame, damn shame, damn shame
Hol' up, yeah
Hol' up, hol' up
So imagine what could happen if I up and left
That's a lot of champagne bottles to leave up on the shelf
That's a lot of music droppin', shit that you ain't felt
Or playin' a championship game without a fucking ref
That ain't official, oh your album flopped? Well here's a tissue
There ain't enough streams that I could wish you to get that budget back
Oh, 'cus once you in the red you can't fade to black
'Cus you ain't Jay and ain't no blueprint to pay it back
I know your struggle and you can times that ten nigga because I'm southern
Oh you tired of being rich? I'm sorry for your troubles
But I ain't gon' tell these crate diggin' niggas there's no gold in the rubble
But there's a price to pay for being humble
Shaking hands with niggas that ain't yo friends
A lot of chameleons in disguise do whatever just to blend
It's amazing what a loser will go and do just to win
And all the tattoos can't hide the scales on they skin
I seen it, a game where people promise but don't mean it
And the dumbest motherfucker will make the world think they genius
Selling niggas water claiming it's the blood of Jesus
Although I was too young I probably was safer as a fetus
That's the will of my moms and pops
Instead she pushed me out like "son, go and earn your spot"
Although there's plenty of nooses upon the treetops
I hope you find the strength and will to slip the knots, hol' up
I beat the block in that old school like I never drove through
I heard these niggas falling off, that shit old news
Back to my southern shit, I candy paint the slab
Got some player got some game, you need? you can have
Got the state on my grind, supernova the shine
Flip the screen out, lean out the window, recline
Show the grill, that's metaphor for fuck how they feel
The hate could never stop the champagne icin' on chill
If the champagne should spill on the candy
It symbolize the days I went being broke to door slammin'
I got mine now, made the beats and wrote all of the lines down
My sound is mine and mine alone, how could I leave it behind now?
Hol' up, ay
Hol' up shawty

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Uh
Hop out the bed and I want me a chip
My flow a chopper, a beam and a clip
Stuffed in the trunk of a car with some thump
Why you jump out the window when there go a cliff?
I'm the ghost of the crack that was stuffed in the hubbas
Born to be king, you was meant for a rubber
I doubled a double cup I'm seeing double
And hut then nigga get the fuck out my huddle
Break, I seen it I seen it I see it clear
Being humble ain't shit when you being feared
I'm an old soul we ain't even peers
Niggas talking tough like I ain't even here
But that's how it go when you do the most
This ain't bout clubs or sellin' dope
I'm talking bout murderin' niggas on wax
And bringing 'em back like I seen a ghost
Fo' do', old dough, here I go Mystikal with the paint
Been bout it, been bout it, 9-5 minded we'll hop out the tank
Count it up, count it up, throw it in the safe I'm livin' in a bank
I come from the country, I know how to work the land
And come back with a mink
Frostbit cold wrist, this ain't nothin' new this some old shit
Barely used to wear it rather buy a mansion
Tossed it to my brother, you can hold this
Dry cleaner my demeanor when it come to benjis, can you fold this?
In the yo whippin' hella dope, that must be where the stove is
Krizzle
Third coast motherfucker
What's happenin'Hey what the business is man? It's your boy Young Krizzle, 3rd coast representer, Mississippi native, 300 block red line, Multi 'til I die, get KOA shawdyHey if you can't tell by now, my nigga, I ain't new to this mixtape game, I ain't new to this industry, I've been in the newpow man, (?) been in the Ozone, been in the Vibe, 51 best Myspace rappers, (?) shades on and all, represent for Mississippi, they know what it is, infamous, See Me on Top III shawdy! Multi till I die[Hook:]
Niggas gettin' in my way, don't wanna see me get paid
Blood money, same place that nigga talk be the same place that nigga lay
Blood money, keep the heater close to me, it gets cold off in these streets
Blood money, can't starve watching niggas eat, I'm takin' food out the belly of the beast

[Verse:]
I reign supreme, give me the cream or I'm shootin'
Pistol whip the driver in the head just for movin'
I got the scoop
From this ho that I knew
She talked about the lick
As she sucked on my dick
I called up my big bro, couldn't do it solo
Late night mission, so I popped a couple (?)
Ski mask and black glove, I hit 'em with the fire
If niggas actin' tough then we takin' niggas lives
The play was in motion, I grabbed the nigga ear (?)
The stupid nigga (?), the chrome millimeter
Extra clips in case a nigga in the bushes
Tear through him like tissue, I leave his chest mushy
The hit was spectacular, miraculous
Scored some keys, now I'm feelin' fabulous
100 thou in the duffle
I'm leavin' niggas muffled
No witnesses for the shit we did
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
Got a house being built, so I stack them bricks
I'm livin' large, Lambos in garage
Credit is A1, no more knives and guns
Shit was gravy, I got a little lazy
Niggas start talkin' in that hood, bitch page me
Raided a spot with AKs and Glocks
They got her and her boyfriend tied up at the docks
She ain't know who to call so she call my phone
Now they ask you who done it? So you call my phone
Hang up, grab the banger, threw Biggie in the changer
I'm seein' cars pull up, so I know I'm sensing danger
Get on the phone, call my big bro up
Yo, we got beef over cheese and it ain't cold cut
He (?) no surprise, wipe the cold from your eyes
Either rally the troops or your little brother dies
Blood money!

[Hook:][Hook:]
Now usually I don't boast or brag, but today different
I will go with a bad bitch and I inhale some pimpin'
Come inhale some with me lady, tingle your nose
Exhale once you're feel it way down deep in your soul

[Verse 1:]
Be advised since I've been ridin' (?), now I'm back in the mix
Kickin' pimpin', the 3rd coast business they be loving my shit (?)
Niggas hatin', all of the while I was hittin' it big
Something wicked, that's what I'm spittin', so they come and they cheer
Hold up, I've never been the type to be playin' fishes up in the sea (?)
(?) chick still in the coupe while tryin' to lay some egg for me
Never that, bust on stomachs, backs, and all places
(?) and sometimes on broads faces
I never act, just for laughs let some broad taste it
Ironically it be they boyfriends who call hatin'
So while they kissy, kissy, I ball deeper with this paper
Truly married to my money because our love ain't over (?)

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I was told as a youngin' don't let 'em take you for granted
And everything for the break independent on how you handle it
Most broads like packages shipped, they come in damaged
And most niggas sign as soon as they get hold of panties
But I send it back if it ain't good, that's how I'm rollin'
As a kid I never had toys that came already broken
Inhale some of this pimpin', I heard it's good for token
I speak it well, but sometimes I prefer the smokin'
It's like a friend till the end then I hold it closest
If it was wine I would get a glass and propose a toast
For all the women that be feelin' the kid
Then I tell them to close their eyes and take it deeper within

[Hook:][Chorus]
Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing for free so get yo' ass up
My partner scared if we don’t speed then they might pass us
So we hit 85, tryna keep this dream alive
All I see is green, I think these screens is fucking with my sight
Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushin'
Bop a darling in my bucket 'til their heads catch concussions
But please don’t push my buttons, I don’t know you like that
Can't do no favors for these haters, I don’t owe you like that
Well, I guess it’s the allure like when you need to score
One second on the clock and the shot's all yours
Hit or miss, we take the risk
Cause anything is better than Viennas and warm grits
Trading bust-it-babies for fly divas that buck
Her only concern is if my car match her clutch
Yeah, she's a gold digger but that pussy good
So what the fuck, don’t be late for this player's ball
Hurry up and...

[Chorus]
Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

[Verse 2]
They told me life is what you make it
So what you been creating on your free time?
I’ll lend you bars if you need rhyme or reason
Some people change, it’s a part of life like seasons
Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend
They’ll be gone with the wind once your jump shot don’t go in
Or your ACL torn and you're a couple yards short
From a Super Bowl Championship and it was down four
Gotta play the field, be willing to ride, willing to dive
For what you desire, call your pop fly, but never collide
With other players that play the game
Don’t be eager to run with crowds, stay in your lane
Pass this knowledge on to your team, but carry the flame
Cause it's yours and yours alone to brighten your way
Put God first and free your soul
Cause even Olympic runners sometimes lose their gold
So...

[Chorus]
Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins[Verse 1: Ben Beamon]
Me, Big and Pac in a black 'lac
Pac got his scar tat, I got my hat back
Big riding shotgun with a Coogi on, looking for CD to roll a doobie on
Blunt hittin' hard, Jack Dempsey
Smoke up in the car, listening to Pimp C
After that, we hit the booth, the killer bee, the track was some J Dilla Heat
The hook went:

[Hook]
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my music is alive, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my booth is in the sky, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
In the abyss I resiz-ide, in the skizz-eye
I throw my Polo embroidered angel wings on and flizz-eye
And hit the nearest block party, to jam out with MJ, Pac and Bob Marley
Freestyle with Biggie and Pun, Big Year actin' a fool
Aaliyah ad-libbing to Screw on the 1s and 2s
And I mean everything was chill:
Willie was talking fly, and Marvin Gaye was on the grill
Pimp C sat me down and told me, "Young'n, keep it trill."
"It don't matter what they want, just always do what you feel,"
"If you've gotta press something, be the diamond on the wheel,"
"cause being scared to swang down just ain't no way to live
"cause even old schools show they grills"
Then he said, "Hold up!"
Grabbed some wine, hollered out, "UGK for life!" raised his glass and told me, "po' up"
My granddaddy tapped me on the shoulders
Then my grandma told me they was so proud I showed up with a booth in the sky

[Hook]
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my music is alive, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my booth is in the sky, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga[Hook:] x2
See, I was born on the block
And I was raised on the block
And they wonder why I talk this way
They wonder why I talk this way

[Verse 1: Big Sid]
I was born on the block, raised on the block
Never slang (?) but I knew some things on the block
My people under streetlights trying to provide
For they fam, so they scram from the laws to survive
Up and on it all night, same story different day
Kids need food and clothes so we going all the way
Momma got cancer and they only giving her till May
Collections team callin', cause the hospital pay is late
Baby momma trippin', she tired of the strugglin'
He feel the same way, cause he tired of the hustlin'
World is too cold, so we screamin' fuck the government!
President and all, Democrats and Republicans
Sick of the smugglin', takin' daily chances
Prayin' with his fam to turn this section to a mansion
Playin' with the flames, don't get burned, so he dances
Hopin' to make it out, takin' penitentiary chances

[Hook:] x2

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Raised on that Martin Luther King
A nigga had a dream and a scheme
Servicing (?) fiends
If you ain't never seen the site of a young teen
Sprinting toward the car like a track team in spring
You wouldn't understand how the product is in his hand
Wrapped in cerane, tucked by the garbage can
Can potentially grow this boy into a man
You see him and disregard him, another dope man
Got a woman that he love, he don't wanna see her dance
Had a baby by the girl, he call her Ms. Little Man
His momma been on welfare all of his life
Took her out the projects her house and picket fence white
The same animal that chop rock, bust choppers
Sent two sisters to school to become doctors
Feds finally came and gave the young brother life
He said, my family made it out, fuck the law, I'm tight

[Hook:] x2

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Okay, I get it how I live, no silver spoons or handouts
Crack viles covered the park-ground that we ran 'round
Chunk his ass for change, no regrets, pride or shame
Refrain from giving eye because we strugglin' all the same
One bill away from being in the same position
Standin' on the corner with these stones I whipped up in my kitchen
Watchin' for them undercover laws and those niggas paid to tell
My partner going through it, prayin' this dope will sell
Taking chances just to make it out the hood
Get jammed and do time, but did just what he could
Got kids that need food, so I'm taking up the slack
His girl ain't shit, and theres no tellin' when he's comin' back
And they wonderin' why we fight for every yard, never heal from these scars
Never give so we take, any day we can starve
And I ain't sayin' that it's right
But it's life, we're tired of the dark, failed for searchin' for the light
Earnin' stripes

[Hook:] x4

[Outro:]
They wanna be down with the last King, Two![Hook x2]

When it's all said and done they gonna see me on top
With a deal and meal twenty fours on the drop
Street boys I'm a get it I'm the K-R-I-T
And the bottom of the game ain't the place for a G

[Verse 1]
Aye I'm back ho stay on my grind
Tight as my buzz and then pass out
Crooks and jackers coming to snatch you through you backdoor
If you want kings then it's that 'Krizzle that you ask for
No one attended none of your parties or your last show
Niggas this slick I keep that biscuit in my dash vault
Money's a river and can't no man up in my care flow
Keep my business composed and talk for a little though
Tell all them fams they having running with the task force
CD don't sell but it shelves if you don't grind
Haters so tarnished by all their snitching that they don't shine
Practice my pimping so when I'm pimping man it's going down
Either in mine or in your city or your nearest town
Shaking the block so much that these motherfuckers hear me now
Hear me from underneath so that mean that I'm still underground
Really don't bother me because they're still gonna represent a G
If I don't blow today I'll just get mine in the south scene

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]

Aye I'm back ho stay on my rhymes
Tight as my buzz and then I get stacked
Quicker than niggas with smart mouths get their domes cracked
Keeping my folk that's from Mississippi like I'm supposed to
If I don't share with you niggas that's means I don't know you
Tricked out colliders shit really phases me never ever nigga
Plenty of niggas rapping but clearly I am better nigga
Boy in the hood I 'puts' it down for the whole block
Niggas in tracks and then that makes them want to close the shop
Hate to the bearer of bad news but you ain't me
Spit out them rhymes and on top of that I make beats
Nigga the wrists I'll be the next artist to sign a deal
Put me some twenty fours on that lick it and cop a billion green
Showing my ass because when I smash niggas better gone
Why would I need a man the street's got my back 'cuh'
I got potential to have the mix tape of the century
If I don't blow today I just get mine on the south scene

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]

Aye this ain't a game, motherfucker like you thought it was
Niggas don't compare to the K, they don't ball enough
Because all the animosity they pile it all
The game's like some pussy, nigga y'all getting swallowed up
Because they know I'll have your back all night hard
And It's gonna cost shit, your rap it's not bars
You couldn't blow if you had Hov on track, T.I., Nas, Young Jeezy
And the Holy Ghost on track, and if they did the hook, and Pharrell aced a beat
Every boss gangster crip'll pumped up a grave street
Y'all niggas must be tripping he going farther than these groups
Y'all niggas entertain but I really make music
I really can't do this I'm respected for mine
They don't care how much it cost they just want me to sign
If I let a rap city take their votes in the streets
I'm the figure on my time, and you sound like (some) mayor links

[Hook x2][Intro:]
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring a stack, bring a stack
That's right

[Hook:]
For the streets, bring it back
For the hood, bring it back
For the beat, bring a stack
For the track, bring a stack

[Verse 1:]
Hey, they ain't know I even rap like this
They ain't know that I can snap like this
Adidas 1's in the club got 'em thinking now
Get the fuck up out my way when I'm swanging out
I own the lane, nigga, and you ain't holdin' shit
I give you sidelines and that's all you get
You don't play no position in this rap game
You just gettin' towels, where's my water man
I rep the 'sip a lot and that dirty (?)
I got that focused flow, call it Tai-Chi
Or that hot shit, it's the same thang
The track's a telephone, I'mma let it rang
All the fuckboys, that used to doubt the K
Doubt the way I rhyme, doubt the beats I made
But I'm the one boy, I got that killa flow
And then they know, (worth a mil on the low)

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Hey, these niggas sleepin' on the flow but I woke up
The industry was unfaithful, so it broke up
So I've been texting niggas for every track that come from me
Say you want a beat? Shit dawg, it ain't for free
Let's talk prices nigga, this ain't Wal-Mart
Let's status quo (?) lets see pie charts
We talkin' 1 stack, that's as low as I can go
You ask me what I think, (worth a mil on the low)
Yea, I came from the gutter, they say the K's a crisis
They ain't talkin' behavior when they say that he's the nicest
On the West he fire, up North he spit
He the truth in the A, in the 'sippi - the shit
Ask 'em 'bout me, they know the K is gonna blow
And it's the same thing, everywhere you go
I'm another breed of rapper with that killer flow
These niggas know, (worth a mil on the low)

[Hook:][Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was a gold chain with that gold ring
Twinkle twinkle 'cause they gold, man
Candy paint with the gold flakes
"Stay gold," said Granny as she smiled with her gold teeth
I got a goal to be golden like King Tut
Often those pictures of that gold, they would flicker
Make it hard to call me nigga
'Cause the chains ain't the chains they chained us up with
This rope ain't the rope they hanged us up with
24K gold face with the rollie
Invisible set with the grill, that's how gold taste
Jordan 7s, golden moment with the gold lace
Gold time, gold mines with the gold gates
If I die, bury mine in a gold case
Slow down, never mind it's a gold chase
Goin' for the gusto in a gold place
May God forgive my sins for a gold space
Krizzle

[Hook]
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the boat man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

[Verse 2]
I had a partna that went gold on the track and field
But the gold never shined in our atmosphere
Gold bottles, I ain't talking about the champagne
Malt liquor, sippin' gold helped us maintain
Hood niggas watching Goldie like that's us
Baggin' up the gold dust with the laws rushed
Snitchin' on them golden boys with the gold trust
Represented by the lawyers with gold cuffs
They order sweet potato with the gold crust
At the same restaurant with the gold judge
That hate the confidence and shine that the gold gives
So we take away your freedom and your golden years
The only time you see your mother's golden tears
Like, what good is gold if you never here?
What good is gold that you never wear?
I hope it pays your way on a golden pier

[Hook]
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the boat man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
And he claims that I owe, Lord, Lord, bury me in
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

[Outro]
And this song isn't meant to be a glorification of gold
But the understandin' that even if I could take all of this with me
That I’d give it away to get to heaven
I’d give it away to see my grandmother again
I’d give it away to be at paradise and be at peace with myself
Big houses, nice cars, all that stuff cool
But it's materialistic things that we strive so hard for
As human beings, and it's not fulfillin'
It doesn’t take away the pain, it doesn’t take away the loss
You have to search higher, you have to go higher for that
The higher power, that higher energy
And that’s what I’m striving for
So in the event that I go and you have to bury me
You can bury me with all these things
And as soon as I see my Maker, I would give it all back
I’d give it all away because it wasn’t nowhere near as important
As being in Heaven and bein' at peace
Believe that there, believe that there, hah
Bury me in gold, hahaha
That's the rapper in me just wantin' to do the hook one more time
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peace to everybody, man, stay blessed
God bless, we love y'all[Produced by DJ Dahi & DJ Khalil]

[Verse 1]
Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around in a RAV4? Never that
Cadillac pimped out, fish bowl, true vogues
Fifteens, but I had to go and get two mo'
Whassup, get buck, shake junt killa
DJ booth with the pole in the middle
For the edge of the rest to go flash up a bitch
See how far these vegetables get us
Pour up, the show up, the focus
The doors ain't typical when they get open, hol' up
You ain't never been sky high
Swear I coulda died when I hopped out my ride
Like four or five times, no parachute
Bungee jump for the loot
Hock a loogie out the roof, what I feel like
Porn on the screen, two hoes on the scene tongue kissin'
You would think my whip dyke
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—too early for the hook
Not sure if it's the sawed-off pump or the bass in the trunk that keep a nigga shook
Careful no crook, tell a bitch, “Look.”
How I work the wheel and the crisis
Police behind us my index was grindin' her pussy like rhyme with no timin'
I think I'm nicest of all (All, all, all, all)
That's the way I feel, bitch! Crawl (Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? We off (Off, off, off, off)
Our way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique
Have no fear, uh

Fuck yo' whip, nigga!

Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!

[Verse 2]
Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around with a nympho? Yessir
Twenty five lighters on my dresser, the best of
Versace, Versace, Versace, my bezel
The bass and the treble will beat, ho
Komodo with the four-door when creepin', slow
I pull up on the high side, God give me high five
Every time I holla, " I thank you, Lawd"
Jesus please, don't let the jackers try to take what's mine
Hate to have to black out, reach in the dash to the Lac, ‘fo the Act Right
Cause a nigga act like I'ma just back down
And I'ma put some vogues on these toes bitch
I blew the back out the trunk with the fifth wheel slump
It's some neon that's red, that's my old shit
But this some cold shit
That my granddaddy wish he could have drove in, then passed down
So in honor of Zebby, I bring a ho down like a levee
When I slab 'round in this glass house
See me in it, it was easy pimpin', 'fore you even finish trick or treating trippin', she wasn't even with it, she was outside the Lac tryna ease in it
She might fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
It ain't really that high, bitch crawl (crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? We off (off, off, off, off, off)
Our way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique
Have no fear, uh!

Slabbin’ ‘round, my windows down, you hear the sound
That sonic boom, that ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bass
That shake your baby momma crib
Pardon me if I phone home 4000 miles away from where you at
If you ain't holdin' back I can take your whip

[Skit: Big K.R.I.T. & crew + employee]
Hold up, nigga
Nigga, hit that new spot real quick called Mo' Grease than Beef nigga, see what they hittin' on round this bitch
I heard they got some fried biscuits too, though
Yeah, they be giving them hoes away though, I don’t want no given-away biscuit

Yeah, man, what happenin', welcome to Mo Grease than Beef, what can I get for you, man?

I want a #1, my nigga, but, uh
 I don’t see what it is on the menu man, run that shit down for a player real quick

Oh, you want the #1? Shit, well, the #1 come with two sides—shit, you can get some poverty or some famine. And bruh, if you don’t want that famine, nahmsayin, you can always get some low self esteem—or a biscuit

Mmm, nah, I’m good on that, my nigg’, I’m good though


Say, bruh, I know you wanna take some food home to your baby mamma. You can go and get her the Plan B meal—it come with a free DNA test, two bitchass niggas. Shit, or you can get a biscuit. Best part of all this, it’s already prepared for you, bruh. This shit been sittin’ here all day. Waitin’ on you

Hell nah![Intro: Big KRIT]
Yo, Shawty
It's crazy though
Man this can't be just all I'm living for man
Ain't like I can take any of this shit with me when I'm gone
Go get money and get money and get money and then what?
You know what I'm saying
This can't be all to life

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Another bill due, I feel to I can't make it
Inside I scream out loud "Oh lord I can't take it"
Please, give me some time to make it through
Yeah I was short on my time but I paid my dues
Maybe, overlook my shortcomings
And if it ain't too much let a player hold something
Shoot me a blessing too on GP
Cause I ain't of this world you see how they treat me
Trap my soul in brains, keep invisible chains
Waiting to break the odds, still praying for change
Maybe it never will, 'til I shut my eyes
Travel through the abyss and meet you in paradise
On the other side where my ancestors stay
An underground railroad that never will delay
Man, I'm waiting on my bus ticket home
Don't let it be too soon but don't let it take too long
I'm scared of the future, what have we become
Our will just to shine got us blocking out the sun
The youth born grown with no knowledge of funds
The worries of the world I inhale through my lungs
Like this can't be all

[Hook]
This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
Money cars and clothes
White walls and vogues
Drank weed and hoes
That's all a nigga knows
This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
Racism and suppression, no sign of regression
Single parent living facilities of correction
This can't be all

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I can't survive off 9 to 5, look what they paid me
Enough to struggle more, modern day slavery
How can they treat me like this
I was the king of the junior high fling when I was 16
On the varsity team, I lead to squad and cut the broad that cheered for stars
That was back in the hallways
I skipped class all day
Friends with all the teachers so I made all A's
How stupid of I to waltz by
Didn't learn shit went to college and flunked out
Now I drown my sorrows in these liquor bottles
Spit game to hoes longing to hit models
Watching Wire reruns plotting to be Marlo
My time running out all I have is tomorrow
On the flow I curl, late nights I earl
The worries of the world
Like this can't be all

[Hook][Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Mic check, one check, one two, anybody out there listenin'
To my pains and my disposition, I'm on that impossible mission
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Before the government come and crush it
Ain't enough weed and Codeine you can pour me
To keep me buzzin'
Shawty burnin' palo santo to clear the air
Lay some Krizzle out even if my energy ain't really there
I'm thankful that you shared
I'm more concerned with a big house and a nice car
But she don't care
But I'm an alpha male so I grind
The 40 acres and mule, I want mine
Ain't nothin' free in life they woulda told me
As a new born I could barely walk
Tryna chase a dollar on Easter Sunday
Then they popped my collar like be a player
Don't fall victim to bein' broke
Them white folk want you down and poor
So get money, that's all I know

[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Nowadays bottles get popped
Ain't been to the doctor for a physical in a minute
I'm sure my liver probably shot
Ain't no sleepin' if you on
Tryna keep up with the Joneses
Yeah, it's lonely at the top but the view is beautiful
In the morning to tell the truth I miss my family
Ain't spoke to my mom in weeks
I promised her I buy her a new house
The next time that we speak
So I'ma hit the road like a flat tire
Run these brakes 'till they squeak
And I'ma pimp what I can from Def Jam
Cause I know my worth ain't cheap
Ya'll can't sell me no dream
I done been down and out, growing
If happiness is the tour bus that's a far aways from homeless
That's a far away from where they want me
Shuckin', jivin', for a piece of change
These niggas do whatever for the shine
But I can't be the same

[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
(?)[Hook:]
Yea, you see me, you see me
I make 'em overstand
You see me, you see me, I make 'em overstand, shawdy
You see me, you see me
Oh yea, a player so fly, yea, I could throw it in the wind
My money don't fold a bit
Bitch I get stacks, hey, what it is?
Yea, you  see me gettin' paper and forgot that I'mma spend
A player so fly, I could throw it in the wind
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!
My rims blacked out and my whip snow white
I've been gettin' paid, this ain't happen overnight
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!

[Bridge:]
Hey, they said money don't come on trees
That's what they told me
But, I beg to differ all this money we be growin'
Sippin' (?) throwin' bread, beast
Niggas stay out my yard cause the picture's on the lease
I swerve through my city
Got, brain like a genius
Not, even 21 already read my (?)
My better music better dirty, so Oprah can't clean it
My top's still here, even though you ain't seen it

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]

[Verse: Big KRIT]
Another magic trick for these square ass lames
I'm so iced out you can call me David Blaine
I'm so pure in lines you would think I was cocaine
Shawdies just take a taste
KRIT I can't feel my face
I'm concrete hard and you stripper ass soft
I'm married to my money and I like to fuck her raw
My rubberbands pop, my stacks don't fold
They paper (?) 20's, my money gettin' old

[2nd half of Hook:]

[Outro:]
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
Can you dig that?[Hook: Big KRIT]
You can’t, you can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine
You can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine
You can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine
I do rap super fly all the time, check the sign
Check the sign, check the sign, check the sign, check the sign
Check the sign, check the sign, check the sign, check the sign
You can’t, you can’t walk a mile, you can’t walk a mile in mine

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Back when me and young Pimp C was out there on the grind
When all that we was focused on was money on our minds
We was all up in the studio, putting it down for days
At the time, with them beats and rhymes, and we had on them Js
Pimp said if you wanna be great affiliate with greatness
Best clothes, best shoes, best music on your playlist
So we bought a bunch of Polo and we jammed a bunch of ‘Pac
And we put on fresh Jordan’s when we stepped out on the block
I was lovin’ them 11's ‘cause they came with patent leather
And if you had a candy car that shit just went together
You thinking that I’m playing ‘bout being an 11 lover?
Check the back of Ridin’ Dirty, I wore ‘em on the cover

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Out the wrap, freshly packaged, Jordan 12s, copped a taxi
My shoe game be the truth, mane - if it’s dead stock, I’ve got to have it
At Sneaker Pimps and Ice Kicks, I hit the stage with that Jordan braille
A few months before they came out
That’s just how it be, know you understand
And this flight club that we be in – black and varsity red
Couldn’t wait to ball on ‘em, stand tall on ‘em
‘Cause them flu games go Fed
So when I hit the stage life
Yeah, them stage lights put the shine on my kicks
Tuck those laces up when I stage dive, these strains got to stay crispy
I’ve got 12 for all of my fits, and gold all on my wrist
And rings all on my fist, like I was in championships
In this game with E and this game with Play, I stay fly like every day
Be it in the club, on the streets or on the stage, I still got my J's

[Hook: Big KRIT][Intro]
Just in case you was wondering
I did make the beat

[Verse 1]
Yeah, cause we just (children of the world)
And they wonder why we bang
Cause police do the same, that's the only rival gang
I'm just sitting here, praying to my father
Tired of today, forever scared of tomorrow
Where's a scale I could borrow?
Cause living ain't cheap
I dropped out of school, pops, cause college ain't free
Plus college ain't me
Sitting in the class
Questions rushing in my brain but I'm too proud to ask
Take it all in stride, teacher talking physics
And I just want to be fly
What good is a degree when there's no jobs to apply?
And fast food won't do cause you overqualified
I'm feeling like hustling
Tired of the foodstamps and budgeting
Running in so much work, we school-bus it in
God and our wrist the only things we be trusting in
All else fails, I'm in a casket like fuck it then
Either get rich or die poor
Nigga fell short and got jammed, but he tried though
I'm pretty sure my first words were "survival"
Looking for the answers to my problems in the Bible
Cause we just (children of the world)
Try and decode all the secrets
My conversations with God always seem leave him speechless
And even when I was at my worst like "we got to make this work"
My girl found time to leave me
Too broke to give a fuck, though
My past relationships got me like "What up, ho?"
I'm just bitter, I ain't asking what you fuck for
Thats disrespectful, I admit
I was just saying, if you wonder why I call you "bitch"
Cause we just (children of the world)
Guess I look up to the pimps
I ain't saying it wasn't wrong, but they had the freshest fits
The cars and the broads and the kicks
Is something to strive for when you ain't never had shit
I'm feeling like what the fuck
They want my soul like my ancestors' ain't enough
If I can't trust my own government, who can I trust?
If I abuse myself daily, who can I love?
Shorty might have AIDS like who can I fuck?
Sure enough that'll be the day that the rubber bust or I have a kid
Deprived of all the things that my father did
Cause the momma was a groupie and I was on some rapper shit
They gave me Hell like I asked for it
Signing everything under the sun but they ain't after K.R.I.T
I guess I didn't swag enough
Stupid fruity pebble chain, Louis bag enough
Popping tags, model bitches, couldn't brag enough
Bubba Kushy stupid loud pack, jet lag enough
Steady acting like I ain't had enough
Ten chains on your neck like you ain't flash enough
I wreck so many times, I guess I ain't crash enough
On the track like a pusher of crack, bag it up
I tell these niggas to back it up
My bitch like scarves, gave the Louis rag to her
'Sace shades on my eyes like I ain't seeing the hate
Too fresh to death, I couldn't attend the wake
That's too lyrical, he been round busting
Mississippi where? He don't sound Southern
He be down cousin it's since '05, I swear
The game's a pound of Reggie
So anything I sell's a breath of fresh air
Yeah, fuck with me[Verse: Big KRIT]
Hey, this that round table talk, Godfather speech
Jury (?) flashin', toast glasses to the mashin'
Dollars circulatin', haters congregatin'
We know it, we focused and waitin', fuck 'em
I do my dirt in the open, let the folk keep scopin'
They can't stop my coastin', not used to this motion
I touch nothin'
There's no bustin'
I'm too important
Yea, the king of the fortress
Niggas is eatin' off the table I set
Before dessert come out, eliminating the threat
High side on the Jet, like I finally made it
Can't have your cake and eat it, so I'm whoppin' the baker
Send him up to his maker, this is nothin' I savor
Ask God to forgive me... hol' up, I might see him later
Or some chick I fuck way back hate that I'm the boss now
Nigga want some strikes and heard I'm the one to toss now
Plus you gotta watch out for your circle
Best friend from way back when be the nigga that'll murk ya
Sleepless nights is normal now
No more blunts, cuban cigars, I'm formal now
Let's get it
Never force the pieces till they ridged
Cause that's when the Feds start indictment business
Payoffs keep the weight off, till you go legit
Buy land, flip houses, to clean up shit
I'm talkin' Miami loungin', skatin' away free
But somethings in life just ain't meant for me
I hustle till the sun up
The hardest thing to do when you down is come up
Get cars slippin' at a stoplight, gun up
Keep a hurter (?) close if a nigga try to run up
Real niggas out here tryin' to make this money
If they won't hand it to me, I'mma take this money
Sometimes I hate this money
Hey, I'mma bully in the school of life
I went from no dough to polos and rockin' red ice
Rubies, Louie, I got that for my bitch
Bags, rags, tags, to ball and shit
I don't think these niggas hear me though
I'm on that put you on a cereal box shit
See men block shit
Hang you off a buildin' till you show me the spot shit
Whats the combination when they leavin' and when do they drop shit
Get money nigga, fuck what they talkin' 'bout
Last nigga comin' in, the only nigga walkin' out
Krizzle!

[Outro:]
Hey phone tall (?) no cash shit at the end of this one
They say nigga from Mississippi ain't got no lyrical content
And they sayin' the South ain't hip hop

Say the K-R-I to your favourite artist

I pull up to the club in a 745
You know I ain't from round here shawty I'm on some classic shit
Hit the club with the [?] straight nasty chick

[Verse 2]
Say the K-R-I-T your favourite rapper
Cuz he keep it real and he far from actors
Two step his way to the top with no crashing
Meet a hoe greet her and fuck her in pimp fashion
Nigga didn't know that his girl gon' turn
She admires my clothes my car my shoes
[?] on the 'lac know that K's the best
I'm a hustler til' i'm rich get them lames a cheque
Nigga talk a lot never really man up
Same nigga I was sittin' down never stand up
So I'mma put the pressure on em make a stop to this
Bad young shawty in the club make her rock to this
It's a sold out show when I hit the stage
I'm this close from a mil' one hit away
I got the swagga nigga who won't ride
[?] askin' themself how he got so fly

[Hook x2][Chorus]
Your confetti ain't even heavy, nigga
Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy

[Verse 1]
These niggas fuckin' up the game, this shit is so suspicious
You ain't buy it all unless you blew a ticket
All off in the VIP, but you ain't fuck them bitches
I'mma ball all summer just to flex for Christmas
Angel wings on the doors, I gotta suplex 'em
Money don't make you fly, that's just my perspective
Runnin' up the score to expose a bluff
'Cause nowadays gettin' a win just ain't enough
Fuck the check up last week, I got a new agenda
The last time I couldn't buy some shit, I can't remember
The last time I fucked the world, I might've bust the center
I bought a crib and set that bitch on top of Mount' Olympus
When you livin' that high up, it's hard to see the tension
I'm only sellin' game, I'm all out of simpin'
Grip the foreign like a trophy, gotta hold it steady
Fuck your party when your confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

[Chorus]
Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy

[Verse 2]
We all off in the club like Sincere on Belly
Can't even drink my liquor, money on my celly
Accountant like, "You got a check, spend it when you ready"
I'm giving niggas hell, pray I go to Heaven
Nailin' in they coffin, the cost of them being off it
Ballin' since Iverson crossed you, winner's circle my office
Fuckin' off with these wins, you fuckin' up with this loss
Waiter forgot my season, I'm glad that they throwin' that salt
Might just throw a toss and holla, "Fuck it!"
'Cause when your wrist game know the grip changed, niggas' buckets
Chip rain in the strip game, hoes will bust it
Snakes come, chop they heads off
Cobra clutchin' on a meal ticket
Motherfuck you if you feel different
I caught a break, no debate, and you still fishin'
The genie out the bottle and you still wishin' on my downfall 'cause you petty
Confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

[Chorus]
Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy[Verse: Big KRIT]
Early like the mornin', yawnin', wipe the crust from my third eye
To peep the true intentions of buzzards
Flock and chirp like they're lovers, but pull their talons in public
Scratch you out like the lotto, these niggas hoes for the ducket's, I swear
Cause money make niggas change like dollar bills
Seen it once or twice, nigga blocked your life, that shit for real
Brutus came through thrice and he murked out Caesar after all them years
Now what makes you think your shit don't stink and you won't get killed
Cause always someone riding, rolling their eyes
At the fact I'm a king and I'm so modest about my rivalries from
Other kingdoms, it's such an oddity that being humble could be a sign of weakness
When they know that I know that I body them so
Why waste the cavalry? No need for casualties
When niggas know that their time is up, like what the fuck they rhymin' for?
What these labels signing for? It's hard to find it comical
Cause this ain't Saturday Night Live, no adlib, no high five, just chess moves
I wreck that shit, never peck that shit, bitch, how dare you?
I'm my only competition, there's no one else to compare to
Unless it's Zeus or Thor
Or a mystical creature that only eat beats and emcees so feed me more
I wonder if all this hard work really gonna pay up
While laying up in the villa with broads that's dying for me to slay on
Not even tripping on blog sites 'cuz they draw light to them haters
Could let a nigga tell it, them niggas is jealous comment on my flavors
Favors, shit I don't do them hoes lately
Big frontyard, big backyard, have 'em send smoke signals to my neighbors
Got a driveway around my way, you a quarterback throwing papers
I ain't worried 'bout no jack boy, these white folks pullin' capers
Where I stay and I bet they think I'm a dopeboy
Cause I walk that way, and I talk that way to them folk boy
Sit my rims on the curb, Captain Phillips couldn't sail where I float, boy
Was a hustler at birth, I could sell Mr. Clean some soap boy
Been a while since I feel like talking that shit
Over-confident, common sense, commonly that we get
Honesty is a commodity, similes ain't my shit
I could say it's popping for sure, you probably think I'm frying fish
Maybe I was, ho
Cause dropping a boombox in your bathtub was the only way you could buzz mo'
And yeah, that's cutthroat
But it's slice her neck or cut a check
It ain't my shit if It ain't wrecked
It must be y'alls if it was stepped on
Yo bitch a freak, fucked her to sleep
And that was the last time I was slept on
Shit, I woke up and fucked her again so she ain't sleep long, nigga[Intro]
We make it cool to be southern

[Verse 1]
Okay I'm straight up off my grandmama porch
Hollywood neva, I took the southernized approach
Collard green pockets but I southern fried the flow
Candied yam drop with some cornbread to throw
Mason jar drank shit, keep the dank lit
We swang whips old schools like my paw-paw
You can't get
Now which motherfuckers said that we can't pimp?
I hit ditches like switches, before the paint flip
I can't be faded
The heart of king born in the 1980's
For real, you never see a nigga like me lately
Debonair, never scared, Fred Astaire when I carry a cadence
Refrain for being lame, ho
I got a surefire way to give the game what it came for
A third coast nigga still bustin, stop frontin' motherfucker

[Hook]
We make it cool to be southern
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
We make it cool to be southern
Everybody wanna ball nowadays, but don't nobody wanna get paid
We make it cool to be southern
Get down if you wanna, crackin' seals, blowin' some mari-j-uana
We make it cool to be southern
Return of 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say
We make it cool to be southern

[Verse 2]
Let me take you down this country road
Country flow, country foe, country fire
24's on the Caddy, type savvy
My player ways never fade, I got 'em from my grand daddy
Old school, so smooth
The type of fresh that you can comb through
Or you can cut it with a butter knife
And spread it on the brain of a dame for some change
But that's only if you cut it right
Off top my drop, rims chop, no cops, drink pop
Lord knows I ain't seen it with my
Green lit, grain grip, bad bitch on my tip
And when she tell me, lord knows she don't mean it
I been this way since I was knee high
To a grasshopper gettin' money in my Levis
I mean my genes, Pine-Sol clean
Bird's eye view with my frame on lean

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Get down, get down, get down with it
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
I make it cool to be southern
Return to 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say

[Hook][Chorus]
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Let 'em know the game you're in
This for all my country folk

[Verse 1]
Back on my grind again, wasting no time again
Putting it on the line, been losing, I'm tryna win
Whenever, right now is the better
Hoping all those stars and planets align together
Tryna weather the storm, go beyond and gone
Find all of life's treasures and bring 'em to my home
Like, like we made it Sippi-land, country and all of that
Tell all them haters congratulate us or fall back
Cause I'm in my old school, traveling to the A
Don't worry, little baby brother, I'll be back like any day
Spread the word, I flip verbs like birds
Get flipped by dope boys that park rims on the curb
Got my CD in they deck, bop they heads, break they neck
Whispering that I got next to execs
That never heard of Mississippi lyricists
Not even visionaries envision this

[Chorus]
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Let 'em know the game you're in
This for all my country folk

[Verse 2]
Leave it behind, the, the, the crime
Fighting for every yard across the poverty line
Any given Sunday could be my last
Pay my tithes with the gas money or let the plate pass
Cause God can understand the lows
The feeling of being stranded on the side of the road
Watching all the fancy cars come and go
Like it couldn't get no worse, but it storms some more
Cause whenever it rains, little buddy, it pours
When you need the sunshine like the most
But even a magnolia fights to grow
Under certain circumstances similar to yours
I just wanna be heavenly, I suppose
Cause success never, ever save your soul
I came from the bottom of the map to show
The world that it's more to us country folk

[Chorus]
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Let 'em know the game you're in
This for all my country folk[Hook]

A couple broads for the popping, if she ridin then she bopping
Bitch I'm sellin if you shopping, if you need it then I got it
If I want it then I cop it, if you don't like nigga top it
Why you worried bout mine ho, what's up in your wallet?
I was riding my Screw shit, rims chop chopping
Top dropping throwin bread crumbs, crows start flocking
Knockin pictures off the wall, we sit tall, and we still crawl
We still shoot, we still score, we still win, so we still ball
We still hood so fuck them laws, I got nuts and I got loot
If you can't see the king in a nigga like me undoubtedly, then fuck you too

Kush blunts Bank tellers ask me "Why is y'all stankin?"
If it's money out here shawty, why is y'all playin'?
She was bound to fuck a pimp so why is you cakin'?
Save it ho, cape crusader at her service aidin' ho

Shake it more for a pimp with my shrimp on my plate

I've been waiting to tell them about this country shit
I'ma learn ya! You ready? Luda!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Let me tell you about these old-school Chevys, Cadillacs, SS Impalas
If you smoking then we got more sacks than Troy Polamalu
Your partners want some quarters, my partners want some keys
In Atlanta we get that paper, can you haters say "cheese"?
10,000 watt amps, 6 15-inch kickers
My truck bumpin' like injecting ass-shots, like a stripper
No insurance on these whips, tags all outdated
I might not be shit to you, but my momma thinks I made it
We gon' ball 'til we fall or this Conjure get us wasted
And I never drink that white, all my women think I'm racist
On that brown with the twist, tell these hoes to reminisce
That my name is Ludacris and I'm like "bitch!"

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Let me tell you bout this super fly, dirty dirty, third coast
Muddy water, shawty pop that pussy if ya wanna

Let me tell you bout this country shit, country country shit

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I told 'em, "aw man hold up," country is what country does
M-I-crooked letter, ho, who you know do it better, folk?
Pull up, hop out: clean, in my old-school time machine
Keep a parachute for this altitude
Cause when you riding this high, make it hard to breathe
May Day, hollering out payday
Knockin' pictures off the wall when I creep
Pros get wet as fuck when I speak
Southern drawl, it's just the way it be
Heavy like sumo, numero uno
Pourin' up brown, she sipping on Nuvo
Pimpin' so cold, never trick on a ho
Outer space with the flow like I'm living on Pluto, you know
Bitch, I'm UGK influenced
Slow it down, chop, chop and screw it for the folk in Texas
That forever reckon with the styrofoam cup and the purple fluid
Return of 4eva, I thought you knew it
Country shit, that's all I see
That's all I know, that's all I feel, that's all I am, that's all I'll be

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Candy painted ‘Lac Biarritz, sitting on 24's - Vogue
Pull up on my scene and I mack your bitch
It ain't hard to tell, I suppose she chose
To send over the clothes, the wigs and shoes
This Charlie Sheen pimping too big to lose
Roll with trues and keep girls in twos
Boy, you must've heard wrong, why you be confused?
See, I'm the big brother of Sweet James
I know all about these street games
But the trick gon' pay, the chick gon' say
So she can't lie about what she bring
I'm certified like USDA
Representing Texas, straight up out the PA
Graduated the School of Hard Knocks with a BA
Right under the nose of the Vice and the DA
Anything we say, take it as law, nigga
When I'm in the booth, no rubber, I'm raw, nigga
Talk about getting busted in your jaw, nigga
Like I'm your pa, run go tell your ma, nigga
No flaw nigga, 100 percent
Old school no glass house, I'm under the tint
Ask anybody here who running this shit, it's Big Bun in this bitch

Country country shit, country country shit[Verse 1]
I hit them with the sub, watch them buckle under pressure
Too many hoes hate cause I got gold on my dresser
Too many nigga watching, praying I might fall quick
Same nigga was in my face last year and that's some flaw shit
Lords knows I've been dying, so this year I can't give up
Creeping like caterpillar, shoes and belts made of lizard
Tweeters, speakers, and kickers
Flow colder than blizzard
Shine brighter than nova, so mother fuck your flicker
I play to the grizzle, that's the bone for you city folk
Give it all I got, pushing chrome with a city ho
Putting on my friends and my kin, hollerin' Multi!
Rep it til the end we gonna win til the sun die
Tell them haters that, now tell them haters this
Instead of jocking mine, go get your own shit
I battle through the buzzard and the cluckers on that fuck shit
Now I'm riding clean and my team ain't nothing to fuck with
A player told me...

[Sample]

[Verse 2]
Now I ain't no chump, I'm known for flowing proper
She bopped off my top you blocked and tried to stop her
Yall flex don't even fakes with chrome and candy paint
You thought that shit could float on it's own but that shit sank
Mister sucka ducket, If you lucky she'll let you finger fuck it
You cuff or buss it, I stretch that pussy like Kangol buckets
Your game too rusty, my game was polished to play a primp
Not even them gators or suits to tailor could save a simp
From a flame spitter, lame nigga
Never had a chance
Break his bitch and the bitch that came with her
And ride off like a thief in the night
Ain't no sense in doing shit if you ain't dying to do it right
What's the word ho?! I got it jumping like a six four
Truck shaking like a nympho
I had to be a king in my past life
Cause I got a crown and my mothafuckin' cash right
A player told me...

I'm just riding with the top down
All day, All night

[Verse 1: Mike Jargerr]
You now rockin' with the fran boy sippa
Fine wine spilla
Michael Circa 84, flows quite a thrilla
Got these 787 dream-liners in my dreamscape
Breaking bread with J-atone and my teammates
No breaks from greatness baby thats my mantra
Girl I'm thinking big time them niggas playin' Tonka
Get yo ass on this butter-soft shit
As I'm finna raid your tomb on this Laura Croft shit
I've been lookin' for a bombshell to come along and raise my Chakra
Oh, you scared of heights? Hold on tight, Daddy got ya
Yea, we finna see cloud 99
Bippin' (?) on the finest pallet sippin' on the finest wine
I'm fitten my K-E to the J-A-G-G
Make these women come to fast every time they see me
Get a whiff of the aura it's hereditary
Girl I do it nothin' less than legendary

I got the type of Candy paint that will make you lick up all of it
Sticky icky dreams, crude to seen, and I drop the roof
Cause once you lose your cool, ain't no tellin' what these (?) do
Any bitch can get in the way and sometimes you jus' gotta let 'em go
God gave you all of that and sometimes you jus' gotta let it show
I'll just let you know off the real though
I'm curious where the hit bowl
Let me get deep in your mental, B-P in your tempo
I know just what you need, so lets not waste no time
I'll work you like a B, rip and break you down
Shawdy let me see it, let me see it then
Over let me see it
Don't be teasing let me beep it
Cause I know how to treat it
Like a old school, display it in my show room
Under lights, over night, light it up like I'm supposed to
Problem is you probably lookin' to be my number one
To keep it real, I'm just here for the night and I'm tryin' to have some fun

[Hook:][Big Krit]
At the end of the day it's a blessing and I'm still here, I'm still creative and I still can come up with content, subject matter that people really can't touch on nowadays. And at the same time to know that I built my foundation from the ground up. That it wasn't overnight, that it wasn't a gang of vouchers, it wasn't a lot of money that went into marketing me, no. You know what I'm saying, it was music, it was people that had ear to the street, it was people that wanted to spread the word about what I was rapping about, about the content. And at the end of the day, I was always gonna keep it one hundred and I did that with Live At The Underground. Cadillactica, I had to create a planet in order to really help people understand what I'm trying to to do as far as my music is concerned, and that's not be part of a box, not be put in a box, not be put in a genre, but create music that stands on its own, that's what was always about for me[Big KRIT:]
I'm straight up out that 'sippi land
Country as I've ever been
Murder beats, urgently, call the track an ambulance
Member of that O.G., more ice than an avalanche
My life is a movie, minus all the cameramen
Minus all the microphone and undercovers haven' (?)
Kept me on 300 block, ballin like I'm Karl Malone
Probably with a chance to be, think my music classic shit
Break a trick
Give me what she got
If I (?) it, mansion, K-R-I-T ain't about that plizzay
What up (?) 1 and all the technigod DJs
I'm on it, on it, on it
Get to that paper, you can't be me
Even see me
If you'se a hater
I stand on my own two
Nigga what you gon' do?
Pump that shotty point it at your body 'till you're blown through
Mississippi connected to Florida what I'm on to
I'm bout it, you can't say I ain't warned you
Krizzle[Intro]
See, they wonder why we ride high
Why we get high
Shit, it's just to get by
See, some days, sometimes, the world lets you down
And you can't do nothing but fall
This is for y'all

[Hook]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down (uh-uh-uh-uh-oh)
Don't let me down

[Verse 1]
See, we be going through some things
Police hit the block and make it hard for us to hang
My girl bitch 'cuz all I ever do is swang and bang
Pourin' up I swear my liver never be the same
A pint of Hen'll get me in, help to ease the pain
World fucked up and I can't seem to leave the game
So I continue bending corners, bitches switching lanes
Ain't trippin' on the sun, sometimes I'd rather feel the rain
Get high to maintain, don't let me down

[Hook]

I made some plays that I regret, but that's just how it be
I lost some friends, fucked up some money, but stayed on my feet
I did all I could in my city so I had to bounce
I signed my deal and got more haters than I care to count
But I can't fault them for their feelings 'cuz I know the score
It's hard to celebrate for others when you're dying poor
So I keep rolling low-key, DOLO, trying not to stunt
I crank my system 'til it's clipping then I let it thump
Put all my problems in my cup while I grip the wheel
There's too much money to be had, I ain't sitting still
A country boy trying to make these petty ends meet
I learned my lesson, can't trust these niggas 'cuz they envy
Can't stop no show, I'm about this dough, and that's all I can say
Thank god for everything, I coulda died like yesterday
Make room for me in case my plane just ain't meant to fly
I hope you there if I fall from the sky, hollin' out don’t let me down

[Hook][Hook:]
Hey what that is? That's enough to live life we wanna live
I can count, a couple cars, a few broads, and a crib
I can count, it's simple math homie, this ain't trig
I can count, that's enough for us to do it big
I can count, don't lose count
Don't lose count
Don't lose count
Don't lose count

[Verse 1:]
Okay, all my homies ridin' clean, it's only right we do the same
Keep my eyes open, just in case they play that murder game
Shit I don't trip, collect my chips and get my ass on
Did without my childhood years, so I get my mash on
Rather sit back, count stacks, and fuck groupie hoes
Stop smokin' bud on occasion, we blowing stupid 'dro
Never been the type to trip, but today we go stupid though
He ain't grown up to be me, so you don't even know
Makin' hurricane to the point they can't see the flow
Used to have a lot to say, but haters they don't speak no more
Shut down the street kitchen, niggas they can't eat no more
Do this like 24/7, so we don't sleep no more

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, you get a mil today, my nigga that's a mil tomorrow
I'm your local hood bank, if you need mils to borrow
No credit, no debit, I can deal with it
If you can't pay, don't lie, keep it real with it
Everybody wanna be a king or a kingpin
You a king, I'm a king, fuck it we all kings then
Did to me, all about your cavalry, and your king's men
Some niggas that will die for your shit that you believe in
Money just a tool, nigga, to find more time
To get more money, to get money and then die
I said:
Money just a tool, to buy a nigga more time
To get more money, gonna blow it all and then die

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Okay, everybody got a dream, while I'm just getting mine
Either you risk it all and ball or you just getting by
Are you the type to go all in, and you don't even try
Are you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?
Are you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?
Are you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?
I'm trying to tell you a little something you don't get in school
By any means necessary, get money when the bills are due
Get money when you need some food to feed you and your family too
Don't worry 'bout your kids cause clearly half of them ain't feeling you
Fact that you get old should be the only thing that's killing you
And stay out of grown folk biz, cause that's what children do
Put God first and your awards will come in large amounts
Now go outside and play and don't bother me man, I'm losing count

[Hook:][Intro]
Good Lord we back one mo' 'gin
This for the people, this for the have-nots..
I know what you going through
I know what you dealing with on the daily, you feel me?
Ain't nothing but sunshine from here..
Let's get high

[Hook]
Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain
Lord, I wish it would
Smoking all this weed don't make me sane
But it should
In a world that's down and out
In a world that's down and out

[Verse 1]
I got my back against the wall
Once again, I've been cornered
Smoke that roach from my ash tray
From the other day and down this last Corona
That I scrape for, gotta make more
Gotta get mine cause when I get time
I'mma get shine and clear my runway
And wait 'til I get signed
To stretch my wings and fly
Do what I gotta do to get by
See the world through my third eye
Would answer the things I worried about
At the end of days, bills to pay
If it's a white man's world, am I still a slave
To the minimum wage?
Keep words minimal, subliminal
Y'all won't make it anyway
Out the traps they set
Follow them tracks they left to the White House
And tell Oprah Winfrey I don't need no chicken
Bitch is gonna turn my lights out
On a daily basis
Piece of American Pie they cut me, I can barely taste it
But I know it ain't 'bout shit cause my grandma ain't make it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can't take that for granted though
I'm still searching for antidotes
Niggas outchea sick from the money they spent
Trying to get more cars and clothes and hoes
That really know they poles, is that on earth winning y'all?
Is every woman in a sundress, really down for the cause?
I can't be sure, nowadays everybody 'bout dough
About the play, a queen to be? A gold digger? I can't even say
But either way I strap up, wrap up
Cause I don't want no capsules after
A rock-a-bye that I deny cause she stay on heads like tassels
And that's not to say ain't no queens around my way
I seen one the other day, but she had bruises on her face
And cried to me that men ain't shit and she fed up
They only want her with her legs up
Even though her nose swollen and eye was closed
I told her keep her head up

[Hook][Hook: Mara Hruby and (Big K.R.I.T.)]
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
(Said my car as I worked her wheel)
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
(Said my car as I worked her wheel)

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
On the boulevard, oh my Lord
Her heels so high, she skipped the curb and ran in your yard
She's so, super fly
Crushed linen inside
This shit way too old, for me to drive
But I really don't care at all
She let me white her walls, and uh, pop her trunk
Turn her out, give her thump
Cause she need it
And she want it
There's no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real

[Hook: Mara Hruby]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Oh the boulevard, she go hard
No matter where and when, if I push her buttons she start
So, out of sight
Shawty cold as ice
Ain't no shame in her game, you just ain't her type
That ain't no lie at all
She creep and crawl
And without a stall or a pause, I break her off
Cause she need it and she want it
Theres no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real

[Hook: Mara Hruby]

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Never ever have I ever seen a girl like you before
I love to hug onto your curves don't ever let me go
Hold on tight, I'll run the light, the peddle to the floor
And take us higher than we've ever been
(A place where no one goes)
Lets go
(A place where no one knows)
Lets go

[Intro]
Old school flow
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
They used to say
They used to say
This rap shit

[Hook]
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)

[Verse 1]
Yeah I remember it so clearly
Rappin’ to my pop about the cars and the clothes
Shrimp and the lobster that I heard about
Like word of mouth
The UGK tape and Scarface will turn ya out
I was like 13 thirsting for a good beat
Scoping for a studio talkin’ bout I spit heat
Like Ball & G, on that pimp type shit
Three 6 had me crunk on that late night tip

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I played ball for a minute, did I mention wasn’t in it
Writing rhymes on my glove so I will never forget em
Had to quit it, didn’t feel it back in high school
Rather write poems, known for flowing, thats what I do
Couldn’t be little Zac forever, peace to my big brother
Follow ya dreams baby, thats word to my grandmother
When I hear the streets tappin’, my beats kickin’ my flow
I overhear the same shit they always say before (he’s dreaming)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I told them call me KRIT, they told me change my name
Don’t be alarmed if you don’t make it, thats just part of the game
Besides I ain't rapping about dope nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
A&R’s searching for a hit, I just need a meal
Couldn’t afford to pay the rent, but passed up on the deal
Cause, it wasn’t right sometimes you gotta wade the storm
In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm
Like, this my dream, this my life, I sacrificed it all
Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God
Watching out, when all the others used to doubt
Felt my pain and pointed down and said “Son, your time is now”
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
Thats between her and the lord I’ll never know
For those that caught me in the Spin, in Complex magazine, XXL, the Vibe and whatever inbetween
It’s safe to say that dreams come true I guess
Don’t let nobody tell ya, try for yourself
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer
But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say

[Hook]

[Outro]
I don’t care if it is a dream I’ve got to believe in something I love
What can I do, what have I got to lose
You know sometimes dreams do come true
Might as well be a dream, dream, dream[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Welcome to the drinkers' club (x3)
(Roll it down, roll it round, pour it up, where yo' cup?)
Welcome to the drinkers' club (x3)
(Roll it down, roll it round, pour it up, where yo' cup?)

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Brown bottles in my system, hoes all at my door
Heard it was going down, and they just wanna go
Dirty all in my grill, Three 6 got this bitch rockin'
Swear I was still in college, look like a hotel lobby
Ho, get on the floor, throwed as fuck and it shows
On another level, let the smoke settle, ho
We runnin' out so get mo'
I got a empty cup, I might fill it up wit' yo' bitch pussy if she go
I ain't even trippin' if the room spinnin' long as I could ride it out slow
Twerk team for me, pro, camera phone is yo' lights
Take this here to yo' dome, you don't need no ice
Eyes red and they tight, two in the morn', we just started
Hangin' onto my chandelier screamin' she just wanna party, bih!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Homie, where's yo' cup? Purple in my slush
Keep sippin', no quittin', ain't no such thing as too much
Juicy ain't no lame, I got yo' dame in my truck
And shawty ain't got no shame in her game, she a slut
I'm in yo' city for one night only
Same old shit, she wanna ride like a pony
Come here, pretty bitch, rock my mic
You just might get you a signing bonus
Diamond studded, the fine hoes love it
Look yo' chick in the eye, she blushin'
Pull yo' chick to the side, we fuckin'
Walk yo' chick outside, she suckin'
And she gon' blame it on the molly
You could take her back, she sorry
The way I killed that pussy, I swear my dick be catchin' bodies
I turn her face to a target, she blow me like a cartridge
I got game like an old Atari - poof - I'm gone in my Ferrari

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Shit, I'm drunk in love or gettin' drunk or buzzed
So wanna come get drunk wit' us?
It's like my heart [?]
Take a Xannie bar and crush it up
And twist the cap on a Jack in a jug and chug
I'm drinkin' straight a bottle, fuck a shot glass
Bumpin' OutKast, bout a half or too many, gotta fall back
That Bulleit Bourbon got me feelin' bulletproof
Wakin' up in [?] like "Where the hell is the dog at?"
So fuck Tylenol, I take another shot of Fireball
And bounce back in no time at all
The same night, I'm met my homies wit' some bitches
Gettin' drunk and it's too late for me to drive 'em home
I got that B plan but I usually got the slow cruise on
But tonight I got these hoes threwed on
My homeboy's futon, I'm bout to fuck somethin'
Where ya cup, woman? Drink, ho, I know you wan'
Up in this drinkers' club

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
Welcome to the drinkers' club, I'm sippin'
Lookin' for some cootie cat to slip in
Magic City, booty clappin', strippin'
In the club, I'm slippin' off this Henny
I see potential in that cutie right there
Just imagine Paula Patton, fatter ass and
Baby oil on her back and
Drippin' down that thong and crack and all her man
Wonder in the world can she do on the gas
And tell ya this and tell ya that
Tell ya how she get screwed and just strip for cash
I don't wanna hear that shit no more
Cause I'm drunk as fuck and my vision gone
They mixed my Henny up wit' Patron

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I got these ideas, I got a lot on my mind
And it's so hard to put 'em in a lot of songs
I try to put 'em all in one, you know
Just what I'm feelin', what I'm goin' through
I've been drinkin', so please bear with me

[Verse]
Eyes wide shut, barely eatin', tryna get my game on
Played it too cool, almost like I'm froze, had to turn my flame on
All the while, watch 'em X me out
Magazine cover, mothafucka, I ain't tripping
My flow, senior citizen shit
And maybe they'll listen to me when they sixty
Breakin' some bread down, treat it like the Last Supper
Toast to all the time we were po', but still we had one another
Hoppin' in, out of shuttles, I'ma be big momma, I'ma get rich momma
I'm sorry, I ain't got a wife or kids momma, but look what I did momma
Got a house that I barely can stay in, a car I barely can drive
I'd be a liar if I said gettin' money didn't make me feel alive
Hustlin', arguin' about who’s better than I in tweets
But what does it matter when a new artist come out like every week?
And the label all on they nutsack, good for them, keep suckin'
Most rappers'll bend over for you, but me? Bitch, I'm not for fuckin', over
I'd be the biggest star, they told me
Signed my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over
Movin' on to the set, I was just a talented black kid
But to them, I looked like a check
Another five years of slavin' and then it's on to the next
I was tryna be what I envisioned as a child
A king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild
Shit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ
Everybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?
I pull that card, good Lord, Confederate flag, shit so flawed
They used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards
I can't get with ya if you with that whistlin' Dixie they want that old time back
But niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that
I ain't promotin' no violence, it's people out here been wildin'
So much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smilin'
Ain't no hotline worth dialin' to say the world needs help
We too busy fillin' our needs that we might kill us ourselves
I got my gumption from my granny, had a dream about her like last night
She held me tight and told me, "Little one, everything gon' be alright"
My mind playin' tricks on me, but I needed that there
In a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needin' her care
It's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate
And pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake
I'm just waitin' on a sign or two, like what I'ma do
When my heart get rusty and tired and it ain't shinin' through?
And I think about death a lot, my father scared of dyin'
I can relate, I call him before every flight, in case I ain't meant for flying
I can't hold it back, can't control these tears, I mean after all these years
I'm still the kid writin' poems, too shy to eat in the cafeteria
I'm two cups in and three shots away
I don't give a fuck about any of the shit I didn't have to say
Lord knows, it's hard to see the truth with your eyes closed
It's hard to protect your feelin's when you so exposed
Yeah, I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed

[Outro]
I let it all slip away
And now all I can say
Is here's a toast to a better day
And the love that will come and stay
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
Oh God, oh God
Oh God, oh God
Oh yeah, uh[Verse 1]
I'm out in Sweden this evening, Stockholm this summer
Champagning with pretty models that pose while they slumber
You have to see to believe it, Eiffel my tower
A long way from that bopper house, game playing there for hours
That was breakfast in bed, too high up to be scared
No key card, you a fraud, ain't no taking the stairs
Complimentary the emphasis on compliments
I really didn't need a suite, but the view beneath is ambient
Honestly, I'm really at a lost of words
300 block to seeing half the world
From the slumest of conditions to living in the 'burbs
Niggas claim they selling out, but that sound so absurd
Cause wasn't we younguns watching the cars pass by, like "That's mine"?
Visit my father's friends on Christmas like they rich and we not
They had a pyramid of presents, stacked 'em up to the top
Get back home like, "Damn, Zac, I think this is all that we got"
No disrespect to my pops, Winn-Dixie just wasn’t paying
My mama did what she could, as a kid I heard patience was a virtue
On the first day of school those last year shoes, could hurt you
Stains on those Paco jeans belong on Tide commercials
So they talk and they laugh, I swore I’d get back
Now them double RL’s is hard and my G-Star’s they got slack
And we grown, those dead stock J's, I had them flown
Didn't even put 'em on, ain't nothing set in stone
Only Egyptian cotton

[Hook]
Life could be as smooth as Egyptian cotton
Life should be as cool as Egyptian cotton
I can't seem to lose on Egyptian cotton
Falling to the grooves of Egyptian cotton

[Verse 2]
It's getting harder not to sleep in
When every day is the first day of a well-deserved weekend
I halt the sun in my blind so it won't peek in
Then roll over on the damsel down for freakin'
Room service replenished, energy needed
She opened the door and she barely decent
Ass out, I dig her like, "Who gon' stop us now?"
I might not see her again, let's go another round
That's how it is when you come and go
That's how it is when we come and go
That phrase never meant so much to me before
Now, as it stands, it's the only motto that I know
Dad ain't get money, but we do that
Private jets first class, I been flew that
Who that trying to sum up my success?
It's like sleeping on the best, Egyptian cotton

[Hook][Chorus]
I need your energy
I need your energy
This world is killing me
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
I need your energy

[Verse 1]
High life, high life, high tide, don't drown
Big breath, taste stale, stay cool, when I'm down
That vibe, that's right, on top, that height
I fly, skydive, high-five, we won't die
See hope, see drive, see why, in my eyes
Win big, win life, take off, bye bye
No slip, black ice
Big shooter, let fly
Don't stop, must try, energy, that's why
I'm doing the most
In the middle of the road or runnin' the globe
I'm fightin' for those to give everything to get back what they owe
So close, don't fold, live bright, live bold
Kick back, get goals, light it up, light it up for yours

[Chorus]
I need your energy
I need your energy
This world is killing me
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
I need your energy

[Verse 2]
This what they want (Want), this what they need, this what we on (On)
Took it worldwide and brung it back home, turn it on (Energy)
Never been scared (Scared)
Always prepared, taking you there (There)
You need to be here, hands in the air, yeah, yeah (Energy)
Bossed up, flossed up, fly like a saucer, live in the moment (Moment)
Get it, get it, own it (Own it)
Live it, breathe it, zone it (Zone it)
No time to waste (Waste)
No time to slow down when we out on the chase (Chase)
Don't be pumping your brakes (Brake)
When you coming from nothing, you do what it takes (Takes)
Dodging these gunshots man, still gotta stay focused
Ain't no sleep, stay woken, gotta keep your eyes open
When all of my energy gone (Gone)
Don't leave me out on my own (Own)
Don't leave me all on my own
Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up

[Chorus]
I need your energy
I need your energy
This world is killing me
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
I need your energy

[Outro]
You love me (Love me) especially, I feel
Different every time, you keep me (Keep me) on my feet (On my feet), I feel
Happily excited bout[Intro]
Everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Verse 1]
I know this sound like one of those love songs
Perhaps it's on time since all the love's gone
And we trap it out, trap it out, but you don't like hip hop
'Cause you don't know what they rap about, nowadays I don't know either
But I ain't like most people
I'ma hit you with that "How you doin'? What you vibin' to and can I vibe with you?
And if the world was filled with flowers surrounded by waterfalls
And mountains despite the fact I just mentioned, can I lie with you?"
Shit, we outside the club though
And I'm knowin' what I'm sayin' make you wonder what I'm at the club for
To tell the truth I barely go out
I know your homegirl, she kick it with my partner, I tagged along with 'em
And they knew a friend that had a friend that I should meet
She don't like clubs, but she fall through sometimes just to see
So I'm guessin' that you her, it's just you and me
Let's skip out on this waterhole and find a place to be
In peace

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Verse 2]
Ayy, excuse me shawty, if you don't mind me
Pointing out the fact you're just my type
I mean my type like when God broke the mold and designed you
From head to toe He know I'd fall in love with ya at first sight
I know that ain't no gangsta gangsta shit but I figured you hear
"I'm a hood nigga, fuck with me, damn you bad shawty" all the time
Don't get me wrong, that was me as a teenager
But I'm grown now and I think you deserve a better line
But not "line" like spit game, more like spiritual flames
To ignite the natural high that we all got
I know your homegirl told you don't fuck with us country boys
'Cause we players, but we all not
Now I admit I ain't perfect but who is nowadays?
A man can break your heart all sorts of kinda ways
But if you take my number down and hit me when you home
I can promise you I ain't shit like Tyrone
Excuse me shawty

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Bridge]
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Outro]
Excuse me shawty (ahahahah!)[Intro:]
Hey yo, Krizzle shawty!
300 block, 3rd Coast, Multi Records, Kritikal Productions
Multi Alumni baby
And they been patiently waiting on me
I’m highly anticipated around the cities man
Ask your favorite DJ, it’s going down

[Hook:]
A new breed of the South, I’m the one they talkin’ ‘bout
Everybody waiting on me, everybody waiting on me
I’m like the only dope boy in the country in a drought
Everybody waiting on me, everybody waiting on me
Hey, I pull up to the club in a drop-top Jag
Everybody waiting on me, everybody waiting on me
And they said I wouldn’t make it but I come right back
Everybody waiting on me, everybody waiting on me

[Verse 1:]
Hey, yo, Krizzle got the next spot, it’ll prolly be the best spot
Hey niggas out here doubting me? Fuck ‘em, I’m a vet now
Smokin’ on some killa, gettin’ brain, playing Xbox
Relaxing that I’m countin’ cash, while you niggas is stressed out
Clean as a whistle, with the skills some would kill for
I came to get this money, what the fuck these niggas here for
Bubble gum rappers get no love where I come from
Hey you can up and disappear for a small lump sum
Fuck what they say about me, never say it to my face
Naw I ain’t no killa, but don’t push me to a murder case
Hey, I know niggas that’ll do a hit and never hesitate
They hit ya in your head, face, chest, and your vertebra

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Hey, I’m right back to it like that nigga the shit
I drill the underground just to see how deep I can get
Hey I ran ‘0-5 to be the King ‘0-6
I’m so live young nigga, you need to get like this
Ozone magazine got me patiently waitin’
The ‘Sip know it, love it, and glad to see one of us made it
Shawty showin’ ass, titties, in more public of places
Hey, it’s amazing how a song get a chick butt naked
They’ve been waiting on the Krizzle so I give it to ‘em cuhz
Uncut raw, nigga all of the above
I got that (?) like flow for these lame ass niggas
No dough, no flow, no game ass niggas

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
It only took me a year to infiltrate the game
And for them niggas sitting comfy, you ain’t outta my range
I’m 19 with a flow that’s a killer
I’m the best thing going since Chinchilla in the Winter
A&R’s gettin’ at me cause they say I’m the best
With deep mind, my grind, no doubt we got next
Oh yes, I got rep and they shit don’t flow
So if them bridges burning nigga, yea I got my boat
Know I got that yacht, where them hoes gon’ chew
On my (?) nigga cause I got that jewels
It’s ‘bout time I got mine because I paid my dues
A new breed of the South, pimpin’ I can’t lose

[Hook:][Intro]
Jealousy's a motherfucker
You weak jealous motherfuckers
If you a jealous motherfucker you just a weak motherfucker, ha
KRIT wuz here
Sorry we took so long
I wish I had a real excuse
But you motherfuckers just gotta be patient
Krizzle

[Big KRIT]
Do you mind if I murder this?
Spit that southern slang over something so conservative
Swinging lane to lane, candy coated sippin' purple shit
Mind frame; I herbal it, southern MC of my caliber never heard of it
Verbally, spit that gospel proper in word of it
No obstacle can topple my run, simply hurdle it
Down to send shells over green this ain't turtle shit
Bolt like Usain not got game to get got
I mastered the Shaolin styles of BIG and 2Pac
Sweet and sour chicken while my partner working two woks
Trying to get that candy paint that's wetter than a dew drop
Down to take a loss like give me whatever you got
Scraping from the game, I'll be a king, just you watch
Sippin' fine wine with breadsticks and goulash
I'm far far away from sardines and noodles
You'd ball hard too if all your life you lived frugal
Wishing on a star for J's but got Pumas
That was passed down to you cause your brother outgrew 'em
I'm a get 'em, I'm a get 'em
Either ride for the cause or stay in and die with 'em
I figured you convert for what it's worth, I'm on my grind
If you ain't living for the day it's safe to say you wasting time
If you ain't down to elevate your mind, then bitch you wasting rhymes
Tarnished teachings never reach the pinnacle to shine
Discovery of Krizzle like the invention of flying
Intertwined with the holy grail and unearthing of Zion
You cartoon Simbas ain't fucking with this line
Ice box hard with a vessel made of iron
Thanks to the all spark I'm Optimus Prime
With the skill to battle rap death in the event that I'm dying
Do away with any doubts that might have kept you from buying
My product's so awaited like Doomsday to the Mayans
I'm fire, I'm back you ain't know who you was trying
I'm fire, I'm back you ain't know who you was trying
See KRIT ain't just a name it's an acronym
King Remembered in Time but none come after him
Hanging from the scaffold and reaching to the youth
About life and how to capture it
The shit I spit is baffling, off the chain but accurate
Forever real, freshly sealed, every time I package it
Switching up the flow so I could spazz a bit
You know you ain't fucking with me shawty kill the track and give it back
Cuz If I break it then I bought it, Mississippi to the core
Muddy water, Dixie rebel, cotton picking
I was doing if you talking Polo sweaters
Granny on the porch while she showing me the ropes
Never be ashamed of what you from and what you know
Cause no dues have been paid and for years they watch the flow
So look dead in the eyes when you talk to white folks
A product of environment is probably why I never win
My grandma passed and obviously I ain't been the same since
This ain't rap this experience
Birth of hip hop's very innocent
Light a candle something so intimate
God said keep going I was meant for this
Don't let the sound fool you my flow is too limitless
Boobie Miles on my journey
I'm killing motherfuckers all the while I'm still learning
Ancient secrets form my technique, a truth seeker alike
I gave a fuck if you respect me, I hail where the best be
No words for my enemies, yeah I pray for 'em but I rarely have the energy
Dodging weapons of man till God find a sin for me
My poetry more music than a singer with a symphony
It only makes sense they'd overlook me in this industry
But I heard they got wind of me
Krizzle

[Outro]
Yeah
God Bless the Dead, hahahahahahaha
What?
Ya'll acting like you never been to a funeral before
Hahahahahahahah
This Krizzle[Intro]: Big KRIT & Breakfast Club
DJ Envy: "Def Jam didn't really support, uhhh..."
Charlamagne: "I was shocked they put your album out. I'm not gonna lie to you."
KRIT: "For real you were shocked?
Charlamagne:  I mean, I knew you had an underground following cuz of your mixtapes and stuff.."
DJ Envy: "They wasn't ready"
Charlamagne: "...but I was shocked that they actually put your album out."
Angela Yee: "How many more mixtapes did you end up putting out before they released your album?"
KRIT: "I mean exactly"
Angela Yee: "I know you did a lot of touring..."
KRIT: "Yeah"
Charlamagne: "I knew people in the Def Jam building who was like, 'man..' I say when the Big Krit album coming out? And they say 'NEVER.  Ain't gonna sell no records.'"

[Verse 1]
I built it from the ground up
Act like they found us
From the sign of the label, tried to drown us
I built a boat in a moat for my castle
I graduated to a businessman, I got tassels
Another chapter, another story, another plot
Mother fuck the ball in their court, I took a shot
Three presidents in 5 years, I never stopped
While they worried about the single sales--
The albums flopped
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord there they go
Trying to fuck me out another but I ain't a ho
I produce and write my own shit, I know the score
I'ma drop another mixtape, and go on tour
We ain't playing games man, I'm too grown
For you to try to take me out my motherfucking zone
For you to try and tell me I ain't motherfucking known
I guess I gotta do it how I done it on my own, UH

[Hook]
I been a free agent nigga
I been a free agent nigga
Even when I was signed
It was multi til I die
I've proven motherfuckers wrong
Every got damn time
I been a free agent nigga
I been a free agent nigga
Naw they can't hold us
Put the whole team on my shoulders
Now there's money on the way
Because the contract's over

[Verse 2]
What good is a team if they don't ball out with you?
Domino niggas they'll fall out with you
At the table with the majors they go all out with you
Til you're underground with it, they won't crawl out with you
So they serve, serve you a plate
Full of scraps and the bait
You ain't eating so you ate
You ain't moving so you shake
What you can
'cuz you gotta drop another album
But ain't make a mother fucking dollar, OH!
Mane it's hard to understand
How they rob a nigga then shake his other hand?
How I hit the road when I ain't never have a chance?
How I sell out shows and I ain't even make 'em dance?
How I ain't a gimmick but I got all these fans?
How I made in merch what you got in your advance?
How I work the tape like I was bagging up the grams?
How a country boy took that country shit and ran?
UH

[Hook]
I been a free agent nigga
I been a free agent nigga
Even when I was signed
It was multi til I die
I've proven motherfuckers wrong
Every god damn time

Mama I made it, got my chain now
I got that Benz too
I got my Louis Vuitton and my Gucci shoes
Mama I made it, I got those trues and vogues
I keep some groupie hoes
I got that old school with those Lambo doors
But I'm scared it all ain’t enough to free my soul
Lord, mama, I made it

[Verse 1]
Fuck what they talkin', nah, it ain’t about talent
It’s no longer an art, niggas piss on your canvas and parade
Okay, so you paved the way, but I rode the road
Farther than you go before, but still, you block the road some more
I'm on my last leg and they passing me by
With a sign that say "I rap to eat" and both my thumbs in the sky
Damn, when will my time come? Should I just sell dope?
For money, cars, clothes & hoes, 'cause they say that's successful
(I just wanna be successful...)
'Til a nigga run up on you and unload
Cause he poor and you shine just like the moon glow
Stunting in your Bentley, but it cost you your soul
When God come to collect, I hope you got what you owe

[Hook]
Mama I made it, got my chain now
I got that Benz too

But I'm scared it all ain’t enough to free my soul
Lord, mama, I made it

[Verse 2]
Forever dreaming, wishing on a star for help
I give a nigga food for thought, he rather starve himself
Apart from wealth, I think it was the shine that got us blinded
Not sure of what we reading when we signing our life away
They say ignorance is bliss, well I'd like to state
The game is just not records and real shit, they don’t like to play
You ghetto famous to us, you just Bojangles to them
Tap yo feet, tip yo brim, and sell it back to yo kin
I don't rap, I spit hymns, my God's bigger than them
Tryin' to blacken your heart and say we children of men
I sin cause I ain't perfect
But I rather save your life than hurt it, if I made it

[Hook]
Mama, I made it, got my chain now
I got that Benz too
I got my Louis Vuitton and my Gucci shoes
Mama, I made it, I got those trues and vogues
I keep some groupie hoes
I got that old school with those Lambo doors
But I'm scared it all ain’t enough to free my soul
Lord, mama, I made it

[Bridge]
Now what if all the things I'm fightin' for, oh lord
Don't get me where I'm going?
Now what if I don’t see the signs in time? Oh lord
I'm praying that you show me
Mama, I made it

[Outro: Sample]
I feel sorry for you, kid
If you're smart, you take care of yourself
There's nothing you can do for anybody else
What difference do you think you can make?
One single man, in all this madness?[Intro]
Sleepy people, sleepy people
Tell me what's going on in your mind
Sleepy people, sleepy people
How can you sleep in these troubled times, times?

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I put the piece on chain, I did that shit for the haters
Made in the image of greatness, I got that there from my maker
Skipped over the minor leagues and took that shit to the majors
Fuck all that salt they was tossing, sauce got plenty of flavor
I'm on my shine like a chrome grill when the sun out like gold spill
That plate on the time machine that sat on some chrome wheels
For all of them busters that's faking front like they for the cause
Blocking the shots you taking cause they know you bout to ball on these hoes
King Tut with the gold, skating all on the low
Prison system enrolled, big time hope that you choke
All that bullshit that they serving
I come from where you whip it in the kitchen 'til it's twerking out the pot
Put my faith in God even when it's dark, I won't stop
Flip them high beams on, hit the gas to the top
I got love for my people, they got love for me
I know my power and my worth and they bullshit free

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
I put that house on hill just to startle the neighbors
Pull up, subwoofers still quaking, let it be known that I made it
From the box that they put me in because of my Nubian skin
Now I rollerskate in cul-de-sacs on twenty twen twens
Oh Lord, there goes the neighborhood
I'm whipping and dipping, the law won't stop me but wish they could
But the tag hood, digi dash good, nothing wrong here
Big bank, fuck what you think, I belong here on these
Hoes, ain't nothin' stopping me on my mission
Set my team up, raise my ring up if you play our position
Out the park when I swing, it don't matter who pitching
Boobie Miles under lights, hater this God-given
I can't wait on the government, got to do it myself
Stack all my chips up, never gon' slip-up case my folks need some help
Hey, I got love for my people, they got love for me
I know my power and my worth and they bullshit free

Hey, I'm ridin' through my city with my rims sittin' high
And my top dropped feelin' like a king
Hey, I'm ridin' through my city with my rims sittin' high
And my top dropped feelin' like a king

[Verse 1:]
Get money my A, pop rubberbands
Fuck what you think, I'm still the man
Young Krizzle top dropped, I'm headin' to the top spot
I'm swervin' in a boss car, I party like a rock star
Rollin' on these sucker motherfuckers that were down on me
My bread got bigger, young nigga you should crown me
I just touched down in the city of the Queen
I ride around town, and I'm feelin' like a king
I'm higher than you ever been, I'm higher than you ever be
G4, first class, some shit that you could never see
Sippin' (?) and bread, as country as I wanna be
All this money that I gettin', you'd think the feds was onto me
Eyes low, ride slow, 2 miles per hour ho
If money ain't your motivation, what the fuck you cryin' for
Takin' pictures of me now, but it's all good
All my real niggas in the hood
I tell 'em

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I belong in the sky with the stars and the moon
I was told to get money way before I left the womb
If I can pitch it to ya, better believe I'm a goon
I'mma be a millionaire way before I'm in a tomb
I made a couple power plays, dropped a couple bombs
Now my screens hang down, ceiling like Saddam
My life just like a movie, and this would be the scene
When my father held me up and said my son gonna be a king
I'm woodgrain drippin', my paint still flippin'
My top got lost, but nah it ain't missin'
He ain't never seen it done like this
The grill, the chain, the charm, the wrists
The car, the clothes, the hoes, the whips
The black 24's with the chromed out lids
They hatin' on me baby, but yea it's all good
Tell all them trap stars that still in the hood
I tell 'em

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Hey, I got money in the (?), monkeys on my ass
I see the laws, hit the turnin' lane and mash on the gas
I swang and I swerve, I do it like none other mayne
My leather so-so, I call my top that butter mayne
I'm slabbed out down 85, woodgrain grippin' get her to the tele
Then I get up in it
Certified with this pimpin'
Official with my mouthpiece
Make it where these niggas in the hood can't doubt me

[Hook:][Hook]
Ok, this is just an anthem for tha playas
Top notch boppers, and the pimp's with tha gators, rollerskaters smoked out elevators
Drinks sippin', paint flippin' congregators
Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right
All night, all night, all night
Party like it’s 1999

[Verse 1]
1,2,1,2,1,2 I got plenty
Breaking hoes four in the mornin' ain't many
Playa, playa play on, roller skate on
I get my chase on, for someone to take home
Now who you watinin' on? uh
Freaking with me she got Beat
Till she shook and went to sleep
You think she don’t cheat
She suckin', she fuckin' 'cause she love the way I spit it
I know she only want me for my dick but I can dig it
I dig her, there's nothing iller
Kinda killer, like jack the ripper
That's way before I drink the liquor
My moves are major can’t do no favors
For chickens with cruel intentions of layin' eggs to get to my paper
Plenty pimpin nah I ain’t trickin
Ain't never slippin’, hella liffted when we piffin
Stuck to the cellin', you smell the vapors when we roll by
So crack a seal pour up and get right...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back up, back up, cause it’s on
Break of dawn, poppin' tops, takin' shots, vibin' to the early morn’
I ain’t trippin if I make it home, tryin’ to bone
Taking pictures of bad bitches and save em in my phone
BBM in me on the late night, take flight, on my base pipes
Searchin' for jaws like great whites
Ain't that some shit? yeah, thats some shit
You claimed that was your girl but why she all up on my tip?
Don’t need to buck cause you get fucked up in this party
Chickitty check your self before I finish what you started
Get retarded hella stupid in the mix line up
Knock em down dominoes in this bitch
Drink ain’t free, drink on me
Store run gotta take my whip cause your tanks on E?
Its all good
I got a little doe to blow, buy a case of Ole E' and some blunts to roll

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Feelin good, drink got me feelin' fine
Doing what a playa does, smokin' just to ease my mind
Foreva gettin on, ridin' chrome, poppin ass pros won't leave it alone
I said these poppin ass pros won't leave it alone
All day, all night I can’t be faded
Too cold on hoes they ain’t for savin
Get right, get throwed, feel like we’ve made it
How could you hate? congratulate

[Hook][Hook: Heather Victoria]
Can't let nothing get in the way
It's a hustle
Had to pay dues just to make a way
It's a struggle
I'm getting mine baby
Yea, yea
I'm getting mine baby
Yea, yea

[Verse 1: Big Krit]
Back one mo' 'gain - life couldn't be better
Shit changed, I Liu Kang, kick it wherever
Bottom feeders, never reach us, ties severed
Bird hoes, come and go I ruffle they feathers
Ever since I flew the coop I been shitting on niggas' stoops
Fast forward Caddy doors, mothafuck a Subaru
Play ball or go home, I'm swinging for the fence
As soon as I could pay my rent, I ain't been the same since
Breakfast Ruth's Chris, lunch at Del Frisco's
Philippe's dinner, green prawns, damn I might get those
I'm popping like Crisco, window came tinted
Now I'm riding something foreign with the woodgrain in it
Word to Dutch, cobra clutch these bucks and never let go
These hoes suck and fuck like what! - cause I said so
Retro, more like deadstock with my wordplay
My life's a vacay er'day
Krizzle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Krit]
I just wanna ride clean with five screens - digidash
Adjust the mirror, flip the signal - then hit the gas
The road to riches, filled with detours, that’ll block my path
But I'm official, to my bone gristle, just check my tag
That candy paint was a mixture of hues
Don't be confused by the blues
That fade into purples and grains
Just know I'm doing my thang
Since way back, I had that, straight crack
Since I rapped on that 8-deck
And them hood niggas used to play that
Like he got potential
I heard that youngin, he saying something
Don't fall victim to materialism, you know it's coming
Just keep on jumping, above the rim
And anybody that can't be happy that you dunking, don't fuck with them
I listened up, pressed my luck and hit it big
They figured Krizzle would fall off quicker than drawers on a stripper
But never figured this
That I'd remained unstained, still a king remembered in time
They could never block my shine
I'm live and in effect nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Night time ?? flow
Locked like white folk car door
When you ride through the bad part of town slow
Jack you for your Acura
That's how the hell I'mma act up
Put fear in they heart like Cassius
Claiborne isn't in fashion
But what they study at NASA mean
Choke you out like Death Row
Flow in turn is a balcony
Beg for life when I touch the mic
Rap and I'm gunning for all emcees
Autumn leave and I change my rap
Flow for days, lap for lap
Secretary of triple crown
Flow, charisma, I'm lyrical
In turn the throne it waits me now
If you wait me now, gotta a big big pound
Like a dapped up Shaq with a triple crown
Triple threat like Michael crown
King and queen no castle now
In the capital, North Raleigh
Feel it deep down in yo body
Can't stop me like [O'Dolly?] partna
Can't tear apart the grind
Like Northern Stars I shine
Success comes to me and you and those who think it in they minds
So shine
So shine
My nigga[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Back at it one mo' gain'
Cranking my motor, revving my engine
Chilling the AC 'til it's colder than a breeze in Alaska
Sun shine like the winter time just passed us, watching for laws and jackers
Cause this shit here too clean to be taken
I keep it tucked off in my clothes, you'll never catch me out here bucked naked
Fresh drawls, them deadstock Js for the caskets
Pressing up on these bastards that owe me and I gots to have it
Wake up and cake up 'cause it's only right
Soon as the sun go down, the freaks come out and they gon' dress in sum'n tights
I'm tryna dig deep, ginger ale and Hennessy
It keep me in the zone, all night long til’ the clock strikes twelve
One mo' then I'm out of the front door
On a mission like a Waffle House cook for the 2-4/7
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
This for those playas in those gator belts
Getting cheese like patty melts, serving up game like help yo' self
Refereeing, calling plays on the sidelines
Super the bowl, diamonds and gold, won a ring like five times
I remember wanting to be that cause I seen it
Don't ever tell a hoe you love a hoe if you don't mean it
Unless it's bout that paper paper, got that from a playa pimp
They say it's work to be a P-I, easier to be a simp
Put it in motion, rollercoasting
Peep the focus of a go-getter
If you flip it once and get it, it for sure figures
If you ain't eating with you squad, you's a hoe nigga
That's from the heart, never pump Kool-Aid when we on a mission
That's 24/7 like a waffle cook in a Waffle House kitchen
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo Green]
Now here's a little story that must be told
A wild young nigga off on Campbellton Road
I was raised on Kingsridge where there weren't no rules
Robbing niggas for they Starter jackets and shoes
Yeah, I've done some real things, family full of fiends
Forty ounce of Old English and some Newport kings
Went from a pocket full of pieces and '74 Caprices
A Benz and a crib in Buckhead, thank you, Jesus
Boy I'm Sweet James Jones when I'm whipping a Biarritz
A Rollie on my wrist and a super bad bitch
And you know it's southside, you can tell by the color
Give it a good look cause there'll never be another
Hoes, a hundred spokes, what you expect?
And trust me, money can't buy you that respect
Gotta feel it out of love, and get it from out the mud
And it'll come round, or get out the way
I'm coming down

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T. & Sleepy Brown]
Trying to get up to come down
Young playa worldwide, third coast all day
Mississippi well connected everywhere mayne
"4eva N a Day", 4eva howeva, 4eva anyway
You know how it be mayne
When you all the way down in the game underground
Trying to get up to come down
When you come up off that thang mayne
Them people can't stand you mayne
They can't, they can't get with it mayne
Cause they don't realize how or what it took
To get to a place where forever is a mighty long time
And all that time, you was doing it big
Trying to get up to come down
Somebody get fitted
4eva is, 4eva was and 4eva we will be
Multi til' the muthafuckin sun die
K-R-I-T, King Remembered In Time, believe that there
Trying to get up to come down
So as the beat keep rolling on, the slab keep hitting that
808 keep going on and the bassline keep being filthy and slashing
This is forever ever lasting in a timeless fashion, beitch!Ay what it is mayne it's ya boy Young Krizzle, I had to come back down on a serious topic my nigga, subject matter my nigga

Niggas out here ain't rappin about shit these days dawg and I'm here to let niggas know dawg what happened to mo'fuckers spitting a message on tracks

You know what I'm saying, niggas forgot about Pac & Biggie, we go farther than that my nigga Public Enemy, NWA nigga

Dawg! Had some to say cuh that why i fucks with them niggas back in the 50's and 60's them Bobby Womack's them God damn [?] my nigga

Lake side cousin, niggas had shit to talk about

That shit influenced me my nigga that soul music so niggas need to get their issue straight and start saying some shitFeat. Curren$y, Wiz Khalifa

[Chorus 2X: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't sucking or fucking, get yo' ass out

[Curren$y]
Uh, niggas got shows to get to and shit
Yeah, no time for fucking around
It's the Planes and the Taylor Gang, yeah

Dash digital, situation critical
Hate to make it so blatant baby, but I ain't playing
Maybe you got me confused with one of them other dudes
I ain't none of them, under they breath mumbling
Scared to tell them hoes what it is, you put yourself in that position
I chill with all that baller fishing
You fucked around and you caught a shark
Cold heart, tear your feelings apart
I'm more focussed on getting my rims powder-coated
One of the dopest, I'm Schedule 1, you just ibuprofen
What is you smoking? Them bogus growings, they got you choking
The option's open, you can hide with them suckers
Or ride low and get higher than a muh'fucker

[Chorus 2X]
[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, straight stunting, sucker niggas, I take from 'em
They bitches that is, get up in the car with Wiz
They know they gon' bake something, ain't fronting
Smoke it all, the eighth onion
Get it twisted cause you see me on your computer screen
Thinking cause you got wireless you get as high as us
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us
Planes over everything, in the fly we trust
Just by the smell it's obvious that my connect come from Cali
I'm good long as the money piling up
All the while I'm just quick lane pimping, big Jane twisting
Walking how I talk it, bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping
Yeah, bitch

[Chorus 2X]
[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yo, now I was candy coated, bending corners, fifth, fifth wheeling
Made a killing with the bumper grill and chandelier ceiling
Plush linen, is you fucking? Is you sucking? I was wondering
Cause if not, don't be pushing on my buttons in my cutlass
Unless you cutting, bitch I'm just saying, I ain't tricking
Is the reason that this porno flick playing, trunk shaking
Knocking pictures off the wall, southern mating call
808 mean no draws, you got friends, I fuck 'em all
What you mean you ain't nasty? Why the fuck you came?
Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane
Mississippi pimp, mouth piece frigid
Dolomite out of sight, show you're right, can you dig it shawty?

[Chorus 2X][Intro]
Hello?

[Chorus]
Phone steady ringin' off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got that work
Chicken with the jerk, ho that twerk" (Nah)
Phone steady ringin' off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got a mil'
Got up out that deal, how it feel?"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, makin' a move or two
Just to look at what these moves'll do
Caddy-corner, corner pocket the bills
Bought a foreign just to go with the grill
Flip a coin just to blow off a mil'
Need a hiking trip to get where I live
Might hop in a Lear, take a flight to the Sip'
Just to check on the family, then back in this bitch
Just to mack on a bitch with immaculate tits on the low-low
Bitch, I'm selfish, the foreign ain't four-door
Bitch, I'm selfish, no I don't need no ho
Han Solo on the creep
Keep a Georgia with a peach
Split the middle for the feast
Fold the money, never crease
Keep it poppin' like some grease
Going broke is for the weak
Phone ringin' off the hip now
Hit them haters with the missed call
Same number since Kobe balled
Shoulda changed that shit a year ago
Phone ringin' off the hip now
Hit that bitch with the missed call
Now she wanting me digging in her walls
Should've let me hit a year ago

[Chorus]
Phone steady ringin' off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got that work
Chicken with the jerk, ho that twerk" (Nah)
Phone steady ringin' off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got a mil'
Got up out that deal, how it feel?"

[Post-Chorus]
(Glorious) How it feel?
(Glorious) How it feel?
(Glorious) H-how it feel?
(Glorious) Yeah, yeah, yeah
How it feel?

[Verse 2]
Uh, buy what I wanna, life of a loner
Keep a rider like Winona
Sittin' on chrome, ignoring my phone
Like where was they when I was homeless?
Now I got whip appeal, now I got chips to deal
Talkin' million dollar goals on porcelain thrones
With heated floors, ain't shit to live
Toss it up, boss it up, look what it cost ya
Awful, mmm, chalk it up
I lost ya, look how I crossed ya
Crawford, mmm
On the court for a win, hustle and grind 'til it blend
She take it, she take it all on her chin
I came with no heart like the Tin Man from Wiz, fin
Foreign, back from the touring
Y'all shit was boring, sorry I'm snoring
Liquor was pouring, champagne is popping, change up decor, and
Broke on the chorus, sip with a surfer,  walking on water
Drip like a snorter, color me bad, stay in the borders, bitch

[Chorus]
Phone steady ringin' off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got that work
Chicken with the jerk, ho that twerk" (Nah)
Phone steady ringin' off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got a mil'
Got up out that deal, how it feel?"

[Post-Chorus]
(Glorious) How it feel?
(Glorious) How it feel?
(Glorious) H-how it feel?

How it feel?[Intro]

[Verse 1]

I'm knee deep in the game
Guess who is back? Krit got the hood and the streets
King-Remembered-In-Time is what I'm destined to be
Lifestyle of rich and fame, yeah I'm destined to see
I'm on the road to the riches, like I'm expected to be
No Tom Hanks, but I'm still getting my mail
I'mma die while I stamp, yeah I'm sending to jail
Cause all a hater live for is to see me bail
Like 'See Me On Top' wasn't expected to sell
Watch you shake your damn head at every bar I spit
That shit man you could see how far I get
I'm a mainstream nigga, but I'm far from commercial
I speak from the streets, and that's far from commercial
A local ass nigga with world wide flow
A small frame nigga with some big back doors
A humble ass nigga with a Christ like passion
Get my folk up out the hood and give blood to the bastards

[Hook]

When they hear that new Krit
Yeah the hood 'gon go crazy
I said the hood 'gon go crazy
Yeah they did my swag
The street'll love me, and I'll love them back
And when they get that 'Krit Krack'
Yeah the hood 'gon go crazy
I said the hood 'gon go crazy
Said they dig my flow, the whole world love me cause I'm
Bout my door

[Verse 2]

Aye I represent for the nigga that ain't got shit
Most shit can't have shit, cause he ain't got shit
They speak to me, cause I relate to their story
Born and bred in Mississippi, they relate to my story
Rebel flag flying, man fuck that shit
White sheet on their head, white chick on my dick
The whole world love the K, that ain't hard to see
So your shit got fed, nigga pardon me
Now you say you make beats, but none of them yo' tracks
Never seen yo' shit when I was in 'Illracks'
I'm on tv, never heard of you nigga
So don't be surprised if I ain't heard of you nigga
Word is that K emerged from a crack in the streets
Gave dope with the flow, mixed the crack with the beats
Words come to worse man, I go platinum at least
When they speaking 'bout the game, the problem's mentioning me

[Hook]

[Outro]

Im focused man[Hook]
I'm going places shawty
I'm going places shawty
I just touched down in my city on chrome
[?] from a dealer gettin' dome
I'm going places shawty
I'm going places shawty
Ay won't you kick it with a G
Yeah it's time for them to see the reason that I PIMP


[Verse 1]
I just touched down on my city on chrome
Been a little while but I'm back in my zone
Krizzle on the throne pimpin' like I'm supposed to
Never seen a nigga on his job ay let me show you
Raw when I roll through mouthpiece killer
Got money got problems ain't nothing to me nigga
I got it from my pops the rules to the game
Wake up [?] cigar and some change
I do it for the late great pimp and them niggas gettin' money
And those pimps still in training that ain't never ever done it
Product of the trill walkin' with Will
You chillin' with a player how it feel?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just got paid workin' on the slayer
I got a little older but I'm still watching [?]
My stacks don't fold my workers don't talk back
Ain't got all my money baby girl you better walk back
Mack like Goldie Iceberg story
So cold with this pimpin' that my momma couldn't hold me
I keep em catching feelings what I want they willin'
We goin' out of space ay me and you gon' make a killin'
I know you down for trillin' shawty show you right
Buy me clothes buy me ice and that's all for the pipe
Break it down for a pimp like we chillin' in the club
You know I'm going places won't you show a nigga love[Hook: Big KRIT & Ashton Jones]
Cause we could be kings and queens
And highs and lows and wires and vogues
And anything that goes
And together we, are closest
It was meant to be, you're chosen
The best, I know, I know
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together

[Verse 1]
I'm talking early morning fresh
Get up, get out and get gone
Thank God for the sun and the chrome
That I pushed when we rolled
In that Brougham or Fleetwood 'Lac de Ville
Goosebumps trunk, yeah it gave ya chills
Popped up twice just to show your grill
Left the comfort of her home to roll with me
Cause she was searching for something real
I be that nigga, be that fresh
Leave that lame, be with a winner
Relieve that stress
Jump online, I free your mind
We don't need no dime, at least not mine
Spend this check
Buy that Benz or ride that Lex and drape our necks
Like kings and queens
Cause if you down to shine, I make love to your fertile mind
Till you conceive my dreams

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let me be your one stop shop
Fill you up when you on E
Pick you up when you want feet
Be your guide, I be your eyes
When you can't see, I be your air
When you can't breathe
I give you game but it ain't free
You gotta be down for the play
When we up, we can shine, but prepare for the grind
Cause the Lac could break down any day
Would you be willing to hit licks?
I ain't the type to boast and nitpick
But it takes some hard work to get rich
It's a small risk to rock the red bottoms and bop the fresh fits
What you want, what you need
Gotta have, when we shop, gotta grab
Never hear, put em back, in fact
Just be careful how you spend you cash

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Just like highs and lows
Sub-woofers and vogues
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby

Just like wires and vogues
Neon trunks and glow
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
Enjoy the fruits of your labor
The spoils of war
There's no harm in indulging
In the things that life has to offer
There comes a time in every king's life
Where the wine flows in abundance
And the tables are set
Feast and be thankful[Intro:]
Life is funny ain't it
Cause I don't think this is my parents dream for me

[Verse 1:]
Cheay
Lord I ain't cha best son
I ain't been to church in a while
But on that liquor I confess some
I missed a couple blessings wasn't ready
I was counting money
But I swear I'll catch the next one
I did some dirt to be the fresh one
I lost some friends over ends but I guess that's what I get, huh?
Chasing dreams that I can barely see
Shooting for the stars, when that's something I could never be
Maybe all the flash wasn't meant for me
Maybe I'm too real for this industry
I sit alone in this four-cornered room
Writing about life and how it goes to soon
Pimpin these broads fast cars and jewels
All in the blink of a eye I could lose
It's all good, love and pain
Somethangs I just can't change
I just can't change

[Hook:]
I can't keep worrying bout the things in my life I can't change
Dear Lord give me the strength to fight the evil in this game
Ooh I close my eyes and get down on my knees
Pray to the heavens protect my family
If I leave, that's good enough for me

[Verse 2:]
My girl think I'm no good
And she should
I ain't done much to make her think different
Late night checkin' chicks really wasn't effortless
I'm erasing messages so she ain't caught me slippin'
I never really knew how much I loved her till she dipped and
Decided she ain't scared of lions, tigers, and bears
But she scared to be in love with me
Out of fear that I'll sleep with every broad on the road I see
Probably so-do I ride solo
On the mission for some mo doe
Ball hard to ease my mind
Tried to call her and she picked up
Said she really can't talk it ain't over but she need some time nah I'm a limbo
It ain't simple yeah I feel her
Says she got a friend an word is she really dig him
I'm dealing with the pain I lost her and I know it
I'm praying for the strength not to show it
Seems hopeless

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I was just waiting on this moment in my grandmama kitchen
An artist from Mississippi like who would care to listen
I'm southernize countryfied no doubt
I hustle hard my slang raw, so what now
Get it in by any means I said
Having dreams of a such things I bled
Sweat and tears, potent dro and beers
Liquor helps me think but I pay the toll in years
Women galore, some where whores
They never fill the void
All I wanted was more
The company up under me was shady
Childhood friends turned enemies they hating
A lot of folk done made it to hell I know they waiting
For me to fall off and burn if I'm forsaken
We workers of inequity, Lord we knew better
It's hard to be broke and do better
Father forgive me

[Hook]They think the money might change me
Well maybe so
Cause I'm tired of being fucked up and being poor
Scheming on a dumb nigga for a plate
With these songs like a good perm, hope it take
Niggas ride with their tops down in the hood
Chucking deuces to the bad bitches, Understood
What it took just to be a man, my plan
Pay me what you owe, not what you can't
I was down for mine, that's all I ever knew
While you was talking shit, I was talking revenue
I told em get paid, stay the fuck out of the mix
Cause niggas ain't real
And hoes ain't shit

Good foot, I stay up off mine
And watch your step
Niggas ain't right, that's why they so left
Good foot, now what you waitin on?
I told him get paid, stay the fuck out of the mix
Cause niggas ain't real
And hoes ain't shit

Now, who the fuck told you I ain't heavy as boulders?
I got a thousand years, surely there's nothing colder
There's no one closer to the Biggie flow
Give and go, on these hoes the number one negro
They blow like Piccolo
Benzes and Beemers
I shine like the sun at the peak of a zenith
Who am I bitch? What you know about the hard knock
Old school time machine
From the light to hard top
No tears, see my face, ho?
I've been passed you, what you pumping your brakes for?
Chill! And stay the fuck out of the mix
Cause niggas ain't real
And hoes ain't shit

[Hook][Hook:]
I got a party pack of pills and a quarter ounce of soul
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke
Got the VIP piece section in that bitch block (?)
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke
Ho hollin' have my money these niggas be talk

Poppin' bottle after bottle, smokin' log after log

Hey my partner pop a whip and I'm a drink until I throw up
And bottle poppin', pimpin' I'mma about to drink until (?)
And bottle poppin', pimpin' I'mma drink until I throw up
And roll up partner sticky icky and smoke it till I blow up
And know what? The baddest bitch in the club I could sew up
Niggas losin' their hoes, hey shawdy chose soon as I showed up
Hey pimp tight, (?) break a bitch quick
Grab me back my cab, (?) that ass a steel key
Hol' up blow up, all day stuntin'
What you expect, a young nigga got money

Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip
We on
No introductions needed, boy just call me the undefeated
And underneath this Georgia dry I know I can't be seen (winner)
Fire vocals because my voice was a classic
Like Coca Cola when they had cocaine in the package
I meant to say blowing the ingredients
But I went to the mall today and all the niggas had those mediums
Little bit of it close
Like dancing with the stars without the judges or the dance floor
Oh and niggas don't dance no mo
All they do is this
Beefin' up, call me Venus fly chart waitin' on fly emcees to eat em up
I'm fly, yes I can beat them weak as f*ck and ain't no keeping up
I'm balls deep and then we big in the
Fat sacks nigga, Cadillac killer
Cataract prescription filled up
I got my medicinal card from Los Angeles, the city of lost angels
A connoisseur of cannabis
I'm from Atlanta bitch, we never shop with strangers
No matter, we strain the slanging, some of the game rules done changed
Niggas is outchea talking like a cockatoo to a cop or two
Now they watchin' you and yo mama too, bird's eye view
With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down
Godzilla!
I'm getting blowed on the regular
Riding and talking dirty on my cellular
Player I got some real good that will save you some
Uh and if you my homeboy she gon give you some
And it's all for the paper but she still gon come
You dip it then you cook yo jaw now you sprung
I have you trippin' like it's nothing thorough
Played on my hoes, don't talk to nobody, gon tell yo girl
(Uh, now look)
Okay but niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip
Cus they pussy wasn't hittin and they lip was super sloppy
Sucka duck a motherf*cker, we done chop the brain about it
But my money corner pocket, plenty game ho
Slap it like a biscuit, king of diamond, king of trickin', what's the difference
Got it poppin' like a skillet with some chicken grease in it
Country born, country paid, from the village to the grave
Worth the payment, body truckin' cus the money I already made
Man I hate that all the time I got haters in my bizz
Talking bout the trill but don't know what the f*ck it is
Mothaf*ckas nowadays are seriously sorry
Thinking that the key to life is putting yo business on Mari
They say you're rockin Mari but them mothaf*ckas Rockport
Always talking bout you bustin nigga but your Glock short
I know the truth so ain't no need in yo line
Bullshit ain't workin, ain't no need to be tryin
I'm dyin to be that nigga that's spyin in the telescope
Prowlin with triller niggas but iron to yo dearly folk
Telling them talk tales, vibs and hung angers
Save it for Jeremy, Kyle, Steven, Jerry Springer
Buzzin like a bee, tryna sting me wit yo stinger
Bitch you could get the middle, (what middle?), the finger
Stick it in yo ass and let it linger
No homo, we give the hynel like the RnB singer Obomo[Verse 1: DeLorean]
Ain't every flower in the concrete bloomin'
Never walked through Bloomin's, it was gloomin'
Droppin' numbers for a feature
Western Union was my partner
I was tryna' get them bourbons on some choppers
Ridin' dirty through the city like I got you
Everything I had about ya blazing fire
I'mma quit when I cop me a couple prizes
It got hot up in that drive
I got tired of sweating bullets, like one day I gotta pull it
Yea - back against the wall, my ego turned into bully
I ain't moving, I ain't budging - I got buzzin' with no budget
Bloggers said I had it next, I was standing next to nothing
Conversations getting deeper, growing further from my people
Lost my love of life in high school I always knew she was a keeper
I was lost since, double crossed, bitch,  now I'm cross fit
Had to work a jelly for a outfit
Outskirts know me by my middle name, ain't no one to blame
Twenty thou', bust it down with the game, everything, mane

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through
Stacking hundreds 'til they blue, that's what got me through
Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through bitch, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves,  that's what got me through

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Pushing that Maxima with no cash in her
Fresh T so I ain't fastenin' up my belt
Back then I was jamming myself
Like who the fuck gon' tell me
I ain't gonna be the best that they ever heard?
Sipping 211's on the curb
Rollin' dime sacks for that herb and blow it down
What you know about that Greyhound on I-20, off the porch
Out the pen selling CD's outside of Magic City
That's dedication, preparation
My presentation too player made
Clockin' in like Flavor Flav
I'm selling lemon stand lemonade
My Forces bubble toed
Boosie fade turn 'em all even
Grandma think I'm smoking with the junkies cause I'm 160 somethin'
Barely eatin', but that prime time flow
When you been up like two days
Trap house, making beats for the low
50 dollars here, 100 dollars there
But when you're dead broke, everything gone
Thanking God for that place to stay in them showers
Even if they're cold
Them nice young women would cook me a plate for free, even if they hoes
So I don't take for granted steak and shrimp
Leave a healthy tip on the side
For all the times God showed me love
Even if I couldn't pay my tithes

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through

Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, bitch that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves, that's what got me through

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
Late night talking like early night
More like, everyday we was on a mission
To get off in a mansion, not off in a prison
Everywhere representing that 'sippi like we 'posed to, pimp
Take everything I love, put it on my shoulders, pimp throwed it
Everything stood in our way while we tryna build
Got crushed and folded
Now suddenly all the opponents writing rhymes and bending corners
Gimme 50 feet, you all up on me
Cause I don't believe you when you say you want it
And it's bigger than just tryin' to get it when you want to get it right
Went platinum, how to feed your kids like fighting for your life
When the choices wasn't even spoke, the rent or the lights
We all in the dark beggin' for sparks
And can't see the way whether day or the night
And some of them troubles just ain't worth the fight
But this is for pride, this is for niches
I need a witness we havin' church in the night
I guess that I'm doing alright
And thank God for good friends and cousins
Cause I could've been out here struggling
Talkin' about my should've, would've, could've havin' nothin'
When my nothing turns to something
Best believe you've gone to see
No matter how good I make it look, it ain't easy being me, OG

[Outro]
That's what got me through (got me through)
That's what got me through (Better believe it y'all)[Hook:]
Yea, the broads out
Bring the cars out
Taking pictures of us cause the stars out
It's Grammy Night, Grammy Night
It's Grammy Night, Grammy Night
Champagne poppin', gonna be hella spendin'
I'm so fresh, yes, this award winnin'
It's Grammy Night, it's Grammy Night

[Bridge:]
I saw a month of stars, my whip Viagra hard
Pull up so fresh, so clean, valet pay me to park my car
My tux is tailor made, but I still rock my J's

[Verse 1:]
Just gotta take (?) yea you can surf these waves
Take a picture of this pimpin' young nigga and you best gone frame it on your wall
It's a symbol to the haters that Young Krizzle wrote the book on how a nigga is supposed to ball
Crawl, grind, shine, I'm
Red carpet treatments are Debonair, yes just divine (?)
On the ride I gotta pull up thick, we deep up in this bitch
Just me? ahahaha! And they all up on my dick
Let a real nigga up in here, halfway (?) gotta make it clear
Nominated for the realest spitter any nigga ever seen in a couple years

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
Okay, questions about my methods to writin' and spittin' bars
I say outrageous shit like - I'm not from here, I'm from Mars
That's where I get my cars, somewhere you outta visit
My spaceship malfunctioned and crash-landed in Mississippi
I see what grindin' get me
More camera time than Brittany
My sex tape drop next week but I got it for the low if you need to get it
My space done put me on, tell all my fans I love ya
I wrote my thank you speech, these nominees ain't bustin'
These nominees ain't nothin'
They albums sit on the shelves
I have a better chance of losin' if I was against myself
Even then I would win, to be this fly is a sin
I'm on my way inside, let the Grammy's begin

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
One time for (?)'s Village
Bad news V-A
This is the See Me On Top Mixtape, Volume 3!
Big KRIT, youngest in charge
DJ Infamous
Coach K I see you![Hook:]
I don't have to blow the gate
I get greater, later
I'm all about my paper, so fuck you haters
I'm trill in my build, you could never, ever
Ever, ever, ever, get on my level

[Verse 1:]
They convinced that I ain't got no fuckin' chance to blow
Like my CD ain't been bumpin', pimpin', since 2004
Watch me go and get it out the air, call me T-O
When it come to Superbowls, I Patriot on the Eagles
Watch me come and snatch a pass
Cause you buckle under pressure like your last name was McNabb
Leave you on a fuckin' stretcher, 'specially if you actin' bad
Try not to play me like a pussy
Cause when I get motivated, I'm far from being gushy
You're crooked, I'm a vet and I expect your respect
(?) on your set, what you waitin' on (?)
I proceed to bleed niggas for all that they got
Take it back 400 degrees, hey my block is still hot
What's the G code? (?) I came to break 'em
The Eagles my amigos, yea, I came to take 'em
And-1 like Paul Pierce, I came to shake 'em
I live to sign another day
I get greater later

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
My shine, my grind, no time to lose
I got 100 niggas with me and they ride in 2's
If you wanna hate on the Krizzle, I'm slidin' through
22, we got that window she'll be slidin' through
Don't get it twisted girl, won't hesitate to do you
I'm a king in my town, motherfuck I choose to (?)
Be a boss
In my city not acknowledging losers
Got a clique of gorilla niggas, leave you floatin' up sewers
If you lame, young man, don't come to my set
Out here, it's clear, I done gained respect
Out here, can't nothing jeopardize my rep
I'm 10 million nigga, homie go on and cut that check
Record execs, lookin' for that pop-tart image
But that Bow-Wow Chingy shit just ain't in me
I'm a new brand of hustler, track star in me
On the block runnin' streets, I'mma get that Emmy
And you, you you niggas better grab them Oscars
Cause actin' what you good at, thug impostors
Ad-Libbin' all your life cuh, but my shit's real
Say you go harder than me? Bitch you're not quite there
I'mma show you the real on real and it's real
That niggas ain't playin' no more with that steel
The best advice for hothead niggas is just chill
But that shit you sprayin' over a track gettin' you killed

[Hook:][Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
Eh nigga this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down, shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Now I’m on my king shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
5 star flow, been a while since I done bossed up
Round table talkin’ I’m seasoned so put the salt up
Get crossed up, I’m Crawford, you awful, give the ball up
We all in, no fallen’, from that platform, got tossed up
Like [sit here?] don’t worry about these others
If I let you push that foreign with fins that mean I love you
Put that shit to heart, played my part, 'til my closet's Noah’s ark
Gator toes, fox and furs, matching belt, life is hard
So I hit the strip money making KRIT
Used to bang for a block, now I’m on my acre shit
40 and a mule, anything else minuscule
I ain’t asking for your plate, I just wanna be full

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Serve it like some hubbers on the corners
To them geekers and them freakers and them stoners
That fiend for that very moment
Brakes were screeching like sneakers but the speakers
Was beating so loud nobody could peep it
They double back like “what you sold me?”
This shit here OG for the low-low, I can’t go forth without
Paying you more though cause I’m oh-oh-oh-oh-oh so high
That’s what I hear a lot but my product is real rock
Nirvana with the ear throb, if you need more you should try
Never stepped on upper echelon with the fire
Now run along, keep the line moving
Cause there’s more folks that wanna buy
And we got that, never sold out, can’t hold back supply
Unless you searching for that wack shit, I ain’t that type of guy

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty

You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? Yea you geekin’ huh?

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Rapsody, show me off like a trophy
Five finger rap a nigga but now I’m Kobe
I been lying low key but niggas been in the media
I know your life story without looking up Wikipedia
It costs a lot to be famous
Words don’t break bones but that don’t mean they ain’t painless
Steel sharpen steel but I don’t know if it’s stainless
Conversations with the older guys laying the game thick
Came in the game like Jameis on some fucker shit
Niggas ain't immortal, but living like fuck a bucket list
Became famous, get money, spend it on rubber tits
The real niggas I know all respectin’ the real shit
That’s the media, mama ain’t raise an idiot
Hollered at the Doc and my niggas is like “is you kidding me?”
Yea, game respect game, just promise when the fame come nigga, you won’t ever change
I’m in this Cam’ron pink, I look good in these streets don’t I?
Niggas talk shit like a nigga won’t pull up on ‘em
You know where I be, talkin’ Common rappin’ bout corners
I’m the black storm trooper all the whites folks mad at
Don’t like female rappers? You only mad you can’t bag that
Fuck you and your homeboy, security got ‘em
You want a rebound you better holler at Rodman
Need a dentist for that bullshit you talkin’ homie
You know I keep a new flow if you feelin’ tender on it
Hotline bling and ain’t nobody answering your calls
How meek of you niggas not to answer me at all, I feel a way
But the album comin’ so I’ll save it for another day
Calling me Rapsody, ain’t no Tigger though
Shouts to my left coast niggas out on Figueroa
To make it spark I ain’t need a trigger or a milli yo
All I ever needed was a trill guillotine flow

[Hook: Rapsody]
Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Shorty now I’m on my queen shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?[Hook:]
They know just who we are
Roll in oldie cars
Polo down country bound
Tight like mason jars
My grandma use to say
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun

[Verse 1:]
First off, I'm the country of the countriest
Mississippi bitch, what you know about that country shit?
Hold on, prolong I'm doing what you thanking
Naw it ain't the chittlings that got this shit here stanking
Jumping, bumping through the speakers, sub boomin'
Shawty I been stroking is what I been doing
Everybody got something to say about how we get down when we get down
Cause it 38's on the crown vic
So I use the ladder to get down with
They think its for the pickens is what im found with
Her face uhh ass outstanding
She micro braided I pull it and pound it
That malt liqour keep a nigga grounded
On the porch with my kin folk lounging
Up underneath the stars
They talk about my state but they know jus who we are

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Psychedelically excelling on daytons and vogues
Debonaireness majestic I'm killing these hoes
Sprinkle game of the greenest the meanest of flows
Plant a seed in your mental and leave in to grow
Eager to know how to get money and bring it to daddy
Evenly so buy me some gators and pull up the caddy
Open my door, chauffeur my car 'round and clean up my palace
Throw on my robe, run my bathe water and fill up my chalice
Sit on my balance beam until her belly cream
If that pussy needs ramming I'm bantering
Player made tailor made
Always in the gator state
92 bulls on a fool thats how players play
For the win like MJ straight away
Shook em off no time left fuck it fade away
Buzzer its all over with
Champagne lobster and shrimp

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Ah playa play on
I roller skate on
I was taught to give them something just to hate on
Like a ford engine light I jus stay on
To find a yella belly I can take home
Or lay on, cause it ain't nothing bout a skill to
You either get her done barbecue or meal due
Let the superfly inside you steer you
Because being lame is a disease and can kill you
So let me put you on these hoes
Chevy that be heavy and the wall that be vogue
Peanut butter guts with the grape jelly globe
Chromed out bumper with the Cobain doors
That's suicide shit if you didn't know that
Need a lil pimping baby girl let me pour that
Sow that up with some dough on it
I was born with the gift of gab so motherfucker throw a bow on it

[Hook:][Intro:]
(Handwriting's on the wall)
Yeah, it's on the wall
I'mma keep drinking til they toss me out this motherfucker man

[Verse 1]
Excuse my tone of voice but today was just a bad day
Label hit me about another single and said I ain't had play
Since Country Shit, hell they thought that was a regional record anyway
But thank God for Bun B and Ludacris because they had faith
That shit would take off and it did, guess I was too country to quit
I make albums not hits, these rich folks don't know about this
But that's cool, I'm back to that K.R.I.T. Wuz Here
Pray to God this was meant for me, a king to be
Hoping my time was near
Maybe I'm rapping in vain, maybe this wasn't my lane
Maybe I'm hurting myself, talking 'bout real life instead of the fame
How can I change? Shawty I swear I think I'm wasting time
On the phone with my pops like, "I just wanna save some lives"
I just wanna do some right with the wrongs I was dealt
My pride might be my downfall, but I ain't asking for help
I wear my heart on my sleeve, don't run into me cause it bleeds
No disrespect to your craft, but I make my own beats
Shit the handwriting..

[Interlude 1:]
(The handwriting's on the wall...)
Man the Hennessy do something to a nigga man sometimes that shit...
I just can't hold back, you feel me?

[Verse 2]
First quarter got me like boiling water with soda in it
Drop my project in the pot watch it lock up like those in prison
Gotta prove these people wrong that don't see the vision
Three nominations, number one on 106, hell I forgot to mention
Two free albums minus label support
Fired my publicist cause I forgot what I was paying him for
Drunk til I'm barely conscious, call Jonny tell him put Sha on 3-way immediately
Cause I'm sick of being lied to and I'm waging war
Then I'm going back to Sippi-land and I'm quitting rap
Ain't that bad cause when I was poor, hell I was fairly happy
Dealing with the critics and the comments got me trippin'
Like my accent and my tone make it really hard to listen
I was scarred but I was driven before the politics came
Lynching rappers and dropping albums, and watching 'em hang
I pushed mine back with fear that they might just do me the same
Cause I rebel I might get shelved, but that's part of the game
Hell, the handwriting...

[Interlude 2:]
(The handwriting's on the wall...)
Goddamn right it's on the wall
I take this shit seriously man
This is my life, this all I've ever known
This all I'll ever do and I promise to God I won't let nobody take it from me

[Verse 3]
I did it for all of mine and all of yours
Ten toes deep in the game I'm in
I'm bound to lose if I'm living in sin
If I play to win will I make it out?
I'm tired of feeling my heart Lord I just wanna scrape it out
This the road less traveled, shit I just gotta stay the route
I hear the hate and all the betrayal I just gotta phase it out
With another shot, better chase it down with a glass of Crown
Put that on my tab, yeah I'm doing bad
Cuz music's all I've ever known, shit, all I've ever had
Tryna say something, tryna do something, tryna be better
Ain't much time left, I gotta make do, I can't live forever
Ain't that what makes me me? No smoke and no mirrors
And I don't even wear Loc's, so they can see me clear
And you can say that I'm bitter but tell me if I'm trippin'
They stick their noses up and talk down on Mississippi
Imagine how you'd feel to know you work hard, and you educated
And they treat you like you never made it
The handwriting...

[Outro:]
(The handwriting's on the wall, final curtain's about to fall
Just ain't no feelings left at all, the handwriting, handwriting's on the wall)[Intro:]
Twin states mane: Alabama, Mississippi
Big KRIT, Yelawolf
Happy, happy birthday, happy birthday...

[Verse 1 - Yelawolf]
I used to do backspins, no Adidas suit
In my grandmama's house, listening to Coup
Straight out the country like a pair of boots
With arrow pulled back, you been shot, no apparel to match
I was hip-hop before I hopped to be hip
Some dirty British Knights, tied up, size 6
Don't give me the spoon to cut my pie with
I get it, hand scooped the poofs under my eyelids
I was bumpin' that Tela and that UGK, and that group home
And Skinny Pimp from Tennessee, and I knew the songs
Mystikal, muthafucka: put your boots on
That's mustard: no Grey Poupon
Geto Boys trick or treat: let's go home
Deep dish D's: drop two tones
And I know Alabama ain't your birthplace
But I just come to celebrate: happy birthday
Hip-hop

[Hook]
Yelawolf and Big KRIT on some new shit
We got that firewater, so keep your candles lit
Happy birthday hip hop!
Mississippi/Alabama and it don't stop
The door slamming and the rims chop
Twin states from the bottom, now we on top
So happy birthday, hip hop
We worldwide and it don't stop

[Verse 2 - Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm hollerin' breathe little shawty
Just look what I done bought ya
The very best that I possess from 'neath that country water
Like preaching from the altar, I break bread with you hip-hop
Just show me where the sauce, a piece of mind is what it cost ya
The beginning of the better, return of forever
Like Pete Rock in the lab, no telling what we'll chef up
You find a will to flow once the vinyl dust settle
I was digging in the crates, just bring a 40 and your shovel
Old school Chevy, sprayed it Ole Miss Rebel
My definition for lizard crawlin' and heavy metal
808 bass in, haters strut facing
While you was Kid N Playin', I was UGKing
"Say it ain't so, KRIT", bitch, I'm just saying
Don't play me like no sucka
These Alpines leave you muffled
Country bumpkin hella gumption, tell them niggas take that
Happy birthday hip-hop, now show me where the cake at

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Yelawolf]
Bonita fried, apple pie bum put me on
(Put 'em up) waffle house, 2Pac's rock song
You see I had to dig to find the hieroglyphics
My mama didn't know about Del and Souls of Mischief
See the Bible Belt gave me the Holy Spirit
But it didn't give me rap, cuz I wasn't supposed to hear it
So I had to walk under them Rebel flags
With my hoodie inside out, with Adidas on the tag

[Verse 4 - Big K.R.I.T.]
Who would've thunk it, I think we onto something
Like a speaker on my chest, no holding back they hear me coming
If you check my gun function, I've been 'bout it 'bout it
The royalties within my jeans and they so outta pocket
Back when Screw was popping, Them 4s and vogues was chopping
The swangas swung like pendulums and boppers kept bopping
Reminiscing on the golden times
3000 rhymed over noise so organized

[Hook][Hook]
Thank God for the summertime
It’s like it did it just so I can shine
I get to it like it’s overtime
It’s all word no playing I’m not in your life yesterday
Thank God for the old school gotta choose where I road to
I give it to it like I owe you
It’s all word no playing I’m not in your life yesterday

[Verse 1 – K.R.I.T]

I’m fresh (yeah) and now they looking at me funny
Like a hustler ain’t supposed to get money (real shit)
We’re on the real at same place your layersProlly the same place that you did (how)
Come they wanna see me fall in the hell or gunshots I can comprehend (but)
We not come around they close like you can’t literally hear a fucking thing
How (?) my aura summer that blueberry bubblegum push purple hazel
FInally they wanna hear something real so we can leave’em waiting (here we go)

[Hook]
Thank God for the summertime
It’s like it did it just so I can shine
I get to it like it’s overtime
It’s all word no playing I’m not in your life yesterday
Thank God for the old school gotta choose where I road to
I give it to it like I owe you
It’s all word no playing I’m not in your life yesterday

[Verse 2 – K.R.I.T]
I daydream about cash while wake up
I’m sweet sixteen welcome home brother cake up
Like an abusing father that’s how I shake up the game
So they respect the name (Young Krizzle)
(?) moving wrong pursuing
My father raised me but I was Pac influenced
This is my movie roll câmera action
No script or rehearsal kinda like ad-lib me (hear me)
I’m so fresh to death I’m past living
The way I ghostwrite on the track I’m past killing
I grow up in a flow I’m past being
On the top of that I’m from Mississippi

[Hook]
Thank God for the summertime
It’s like it did it just so I can shine
I get to it like it’s overtime
It’s all word no playing I’m not in your life yesterday
Thank God for the old school gotta choose where I road to
I give it to it like I owe you
It’s all word no playing I’m not in your life yesterday

[Bridge – Jeff B]

I turned a hater into a believer
I’m the one that they pay to see (I)
I break bread with the hood ‘cause the hood’s been good to me (I)
Now it’s the time re-up (here we go)
Me and my people just (?) and we (?)
So Imma keep busting until the beat drop until I’m on top

Aye, let me holla for a second
Shoot some game in your direction
'bout this pimp shit, you was tailor-made
For this outfit

Mind molded, brave ho, blindfolded
Hands tied, never fall, landsliding
I'm your man now, your one and only
Your best friend, your homie
Confidant when you lonely
Tell me all your dreams
And I'll proceed to sew the seams of this love affair
A blanket with my arms to keep you warm
Stay up under here
Picture us rollin', car not stolen
Gator shoes on my feet, chinchilla on my shoulders
Coasting down 85 as you drive
I puff this loud, put it in the air, sky-high
A certified gold mine between your thighs
I polish it and set it out to let it shine
We going places like we never been
Our side of town is smaller than the smallest town we in
These lenses see your flaws
Down for your cause
When you let down your guard and I broke down your walls
My number one starter
Proud of you, no doubt in you, nothing like your father
I drafted you then coached you in when no one else would bother

[Hook]
Hey you (Hey you)
Baby, baby (Get down with this team shawty)
I wanna talk to you (Let me talk to you)
Baby, baby (Put you in this game, be my starter)
Hey you
Baby, baby (Let me be your Bulls)
I wanna talk to you (Get you a couple rings, babygirl)
Baby, baby (We goin places '09, ya feel me?)

[Verse 2]
A'ight, ok, a'ight, pretty brown eyes
You can't deny I got you twisted like a dread
On Erykah Badu's head that went missing
You gifted and I know it
Down to help you show it
Pimpin' is as fluid as water, let me pour it
On your mind
Drip into your veins, feel it tingle in your spine
Pump into your heart
Lose control, let it ride
Give it all you got
Any doubts, let 'em die
It's just you and I, sho' you right
Everything is everything, chillin' in the breeze
Why give it up for love when you can charge a trick a fee?
Don't know how you should budget?
Baby, bring that shit to me
I'll knock it up and stretch it as far as the eye could see
So forward flow
Colder than cold could wish to be
?... smell of P-I-M-P
Sippin' saki with Chinese broads that dig my spit
Holla "Wo Ai Ni K.R.I.T" when they jump on my tip
Chyeaaa[Chorus: Jill Scott]
It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Pick up when I call ya', I'ma be there in a second
Need directions when you get this message, somethin's goin' on
Earlier this mornin', had a feelin' that we might've hit the ceiling
And our purpose ain't fulfillin' in this home, so
Maybe we should take some time on it
Put a groove on, and bump and grind on it
And get our mind right, the stars align like our very vessels
And I know that we ain't planets but I'm knowin' somethin' special
Comes from callin' Heaven, dialin' seven's, waitin' on a pickup
Stomach bigger, skin is glowin', girl I love your figure
This is simple, this is real, somethin' to remember
Had to hit ya, so we could blend such a lovely mixture

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Pick up when I call ya, I was starvin' for your garden
And I heard that you was thirsty, this is perfect, I got water
We could plant a seed and grow it, won't nobody know it
'Til' you showin', overflowin', overdoin', double soulin', hey
This ain't 'bout no bill collectors askin' you for time
Sally Mae can't get connected when you on this line
This is private, this a island, this is more than bein' worth it
This is callin' when yo' lights go out and they start back workin'
This is unexpected, such a blessing, had to tell you to express it
You wouldn't feel it if I texted no emojis were selective
Because I'm serious 'bout this here
Signal strong, I'm clear about this here

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Hydration
Meditation, elevation
Celebration
Levitation, this is danger
Higher callin', higher callin'
Ooh, we got a higher callin', higher callin'
Higher callin', higher
Higher callin', higher[Verse]

Hey I got my swagger back, hey I got my swagger back
Hey, 6-0-1 motherfucker, do it big
Underground scenes, last mainstream artist underground
Nigga that (?) heard that

[Verse 1:]
Fuck a nightrider, I'm a slab rider
And every yellow 'Lac look like I'm a cab driver
I'm that new school, I'm that throw down
I'm that rain on your ass when it pours down
Violently moving, consuming everything I see
An underdog, but a king's what I'm meant to be
Clap at a hater, my family's hunger is my motivation
I use the track as a pulpit to speak to congregations
I Mobb Deeper than than G-Unit, so I get away
They told me, keep going K, you're just one hit away
My beats is Heavenly shawty, but my flow is Hell
(?) my city when there ain't no dope to sell
I'm a street scholar, ahead of my time
I'mma a pro with the tool like (?)
Turning water to wine, I'm a miracle worker
If that 9 don't get you, that chopper'll hurt ya


[Hook:]
Yea, I am cuz, better make way
Still gonna blow, I gives a fuck what you think man
'sippi my hometown, where niggas don't play around
Show what gutter is when we lay down that four pound

[Verse 2:]
The swagger simply genius, the flow retarded too
Same nigga cooking up the crack did the barbecue
And I ain't got no love for them niggas (?) talkin'
(?) when they outside of the club walkin'
Code Red, the K about to see a mil
Lights out for a hater if I sign a deal
Hey this is universal, NASA spaceship
(?) when we cook crack, so I knownin' that they taste it
They fiend for it, that Krizzle, that (?) basic
A lot of dope boys out here tryna duplicate it
(?) 18 in the Regal
(?) don't know about me yet, but I'm so illegal
I got that mic mentality, I tell 'em just do it
I pass the rock to the J's, don't let 'em shoot it
Hey this is real nigga, and that's on everything
I got the hood jumping bitch, and that's on everything

[Hook - Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I was doing it big, all on my own
Gripping wood grain and riding on chrome
Sprinkling game everywhere that I go
Cause all these horny girls want to fuck
Now I was old school riding, slamming my doors
Reclining, shining like a pimp s'posed
Life ain't nothing but an EQ of highs and lows
(And it's okay) An EQ of highs and lows

[Verse 1 - Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I got more than your amount
What's in your account?
Young Krizzle the newest out the south
So it's going down
I think you a hater if you can't see that I'm playa
With this evil major leaguer and these fuschia alligators
Shawty got me fucked up
I'm never slipping, never tricking
For no treats that ain't for free up on these streets if it ain't Halloween
And why these boppers on my dick, I swear they trying to fuck my whip
Bobbing cause my paint was candy sour apple green
I pull the baddest broads up out they drawers and barely wave
If you ain't winning in this game, then you've barely played
If you ain't buying what you want, then you barely paid
Didn't see me hiding, you can barely hate

[Hook - Big K.R.I.T.]

[Verse 2 - Big K.R.I.T.]
I got everything you want, everything you need
Damn right, I'm the coldest nigga out, you liable to freeze
Never ever bring your girl around, she liable to leave
She ain't never been around a pimp, she was dying to see
I'm mouthpiece at his prime
The flyest of the freshest that was freshest of the fly
I'm majoring in pimping, I'm just rapping on the side
For the Benz with the trim and the teriyaki tires
And a plane that don't take off if I don't ride
Oh so live, like Pay-Per-View
Let me show you what paper do
Make her pop it and drop it, slide back and forth like a fader do
My bezel is incredible, swear my vessel was hater-proof
Only me, myself and I is who I cater to

[Hook - Big K.R.I.T.]

[Bridge - Big K.R.I.T.]
I'd rather be with you-oo, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you-oo, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you, ooh

[Hook - Big K.R.I.T.][Hook:] x2
Hey, when you see me, you should see me on top
I'mma get money and this shit won't stop
I always stood as a man, head to the sky
747 so fly
And if I die, bury me a legend
A king remembered in time, and that's like forever
Papa told me, remember one thing little nigga
What that is?

[Verse 1:]
Real niggas in the hood like "we feel you, KRIT"
Either you dead or paralyzed not to feel my shit
Or you just a hater, I see it in they eyes
More money, more problems, and more lies
Haters like flies, can't tell the difference
Soon as shit going down, they diving right in it
I'm shining light in it, I'm shining light on 'em
I'mma giant where I'm from, I got some height on me
I'm married to my money, throw some rice on me
If you owe me, pay up, respect my wife homie
You coming up short, you know the price homie
Next time put it all on your life homie
I'm still grinding for that big lick
I might shit on niggas when I get rich
Lord forgive me for these harsh gestures
But these haters never wanna see you doing better

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Soon as I'm out, they pull me right back into it
A lot of prayer and patron how I get through it
Look into the eyes of a wounded soldier
I'll stop when I die or this movement over
It's straight up the gut cause they moving over
Sippin' lead (?), got next, and Young Krizzle told ya
I got the have-nots on call
I don't jump ship, I ride 'til the sails fall off
On 'til my whole family boss hog
I gotta couple pits (?) I can't call off
When I'm chopping down the block whip rimmed up
I gotta start dying if I plan to throw this M up
Mississippi 'til the death of me
At this point, I'm the last of a dying breed
The last of the Mohicans
The last king with his own kingdom

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Father, I got my hand on my pistol
Screaming fuck the world as I'm looking through my rearview
Back to the corner, back to the slum
Gorilla warfare, we call it Vietnam
I've lost and I've gained and some have done the same
Pour out a little liquor for my rest in peace niggas
Shit
Real playas know the score now
Can't do good without a lame acting ho now
Niggas wanna show out
Cause you're getting money
That type of shit they on be Dave Chappelle funny
But we don't laugh at these pussy niggas
They sell booties, somebody throw cash on these pussy niggas
Hold up, yea, I don't think that they heard me homie
Suicide door, grain blow (?), call it murder homie
I'm tied to the streets and I ain't budgin'
300 little nigga and I'm still thuggin'

[Hook:][Intro:]
Hey this is playa shit right here my nigga
(Hey hold up)
Two step your way to the top on this one, know what I'm sayin'?
(Let me put some candy in it)
All them niggas out there on the playas houses and cuthroats and Chevies (?)
Get head swing wide

[Verse 1:]
Drop top Chevy with the bubble (?)
24's on the feet, you can keep them twins
I'm grown man with it, got a mind full of pimpin'
I'm aware of this condition, a G never slippin'
Haters stand at me so I chunk up the tre
I'm feeling good, just got a clean shave and a fade
I trick out the whips, I rock the newest kicks
I cut the best broads, you (?) my shit
Y'all ain't never seen a young nigga quite like me
Mind-frame 31 but I'm only 19
Ahead of the rest, they love seeing me dawg
'Bout as much as I love seeing me ball
Whippin' on grain while I'm swanging wide
Getting head from a bopper on I-2-5
Sippin' on syrup and I'm puffin' skunk
It's like a live-show when I pop my trunk

[Hook:]
I said hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some candy in it
Drop-top looking mean my nigga
Flying in the jet feeling clean my nigga

[Verse 2:]
Hey, you can bet I got a ball out sittin' on swingers
8-Ball, M-J-G in my changer
Light up in the cloud while the bass be heavy
Haters said they never seen angel wings on a Chevy
Gleamin' and glossin', ridin' and flossin'
Buy one of everything, fuck what its costin'
If often, niggas wanna test this wonder
Got a bitch named Nina, leave you 6 feet under
When I roll through all the hoes gon' choose
Candy paint so blue, ride look like a pool
Ain't never been a lame, always been a trill nigga
Anything beside real, I ain't never fuck with it
Yea I been up 'bout my (?)
I ain't never been a faker
And I won't rock a grill unless Paul Wall make it
Hey I sip my trends that'll make my mores (?)
Gettin' paid everyday is how I play my part

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I'm flying in the jet, I'm the pimp of the week
Player than a motherfuckin' car full of freaks
(I'm clean from head to toe
Cup full of lean and it overflow)
Money over bitches, gotta get this paper
Ain't shit changed, still fuck these haters

[Bridge:]
I'm leanin' back, grippin' grain
Diamonds shine and do my thang
I know you feel me, church
I know you dig me
Everything I say, you know I mean
The things I got, nigga you can't dream
Houses, cars, and clothes, church
New day, a different ho
Everything how it's supposed to be
This is the life that's meant for me

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
That Hood Fame, you heard shawty?[Hook:]
I used to have a whole lotta nothin'
Thats why a nigga can't stop hustlin'
But as soon as I get it
I'll be comin' right back wit' it
I'm comin' home again
Home again

[Verse 1: Tha Joker]
This exactly where it's at
My heart to be exact
I moved to A-T-L, but I be right back
Man my sister need a house, my granny need a 'lac
So like the surface I'm just trying to get scratched
Ariana Ms. Tatted, Daddy missin'
Ariana your momma put me through drama
Sleepin' on me like Pajamas
We all goin' through depression and I hate to see my kin hurt
So I need my cash now, J-G Wentworth
K.O. till I go Ms. Walkin' down Weatherly
Alotta shit changed so the same it will never be
Niggas hatin' on me but you must respect the real
Thats why Imma show 'em somethin' fire-marshall bill
For real

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I'm comin' home
Like I never left, cruise the city while bendin' corners
Chunk the deuce to the non-believers, and parlay with my playa homies
They knew just want it took for me to be the man that I am today
Channel the son tears and money black thats why good lord paved the way
For a nigga to see everything a nigga would dream
Right here before his eyes
And removed though they never had good intentions
I beat the devil while he in disguise
From a mile away, I'm doin' good, and I'm proud to say
That I can pay my bills and buy my meals and woke my wheel
In my home from where my family stay
If need be finally be there for them like they were for me
Ain't shit shit change but my lyrical 3hunna till I D-I-E
I'm just statin' facts
Happiness all I need, just gotta pray for that
Everything here cost me blood, sweat, tears, and yes I paid for that[Wes Fif: Hook]
I reign supreme
Gotta make that cheese
Gotta go on the work
Boy I gotta cross two seas
They make that play cause I'm ripping like a Russian AK
Cause I grinding and chasing the dream
This ain't only for me
Say what?
Cause I do it for the home team! (I grind)
For the home team (I ball), for the home team (Stand tall)
For the hometeam, I do this for the home team! (Go real)
For the home team (I work), for the home team (Go bezerk)
For the home team, I do this for the home team! (Uh!)

[Wes Fif: Verse 1]
Lit fast and blunt full'a lit grass
Big wheels on a whip bitch, big ass
In the South all we do is get cash
Can't do shit but copy and get mad
Eat your heart out, suck a nigga
?
That's why they don't fuck with me
Can't walk like this, so it's tough to see
Off sets on a 65' gt
Though the south spill oil like BP
Uhh, but I clean up nice, married to the game
No prenup, nice
No honeymoon, I ain't even throw rice
Eat the whole pie won't leave no slice
Spit so sick gotta play that twice
Call Young G I don't need to rock ice
Yeah, and you don't even gotta ask
All up front need all my cash
I go hard then all ya'll ass
You can go ahead and kiss all my ass
That Marlins stay on my hat
You know this that Florida shit
Ya'll niggers know what it is
Dirty South we run this shit!

[Big K.R.I.T: Verse 2]
Hey ball out with me, crawl out with me, hear a lot of screams Saying fall out with me
I'm all out with it, like he ain't saying nothing
Niggas bark all day (woof), ain't scared of nothing
Still in the hood like C
Autographing titties and hoes is taking photos
Of the baddest of bitches, bust it open call it porno
Smokin' live cuz ?
Higher then the bitch, skyscraper and taller
Fly as the kicks
Rims to big that the tire won't fit
We drinking fire water and blow fire on this
One of yours could mind my wrist
And mind my tag, bitch too close shit mind my swag
Trunk on glow, tool on deck, the blind could admire my flash
I think I'm on fire, Patrón, 6
[?] Tires, supreme, whippin
[?] look at it swang
Never seen a sound? well look at it bang!
Look at my name! Who said I ain't King?
Stand there, throw some paper look at it rain
Pull out my label, pull on my frame
Reclining with diamonds against my brain

[CyHi Da Prynce: Verse 3]
From the Atl to Orlando, ain't a state that I can't go
I just sit in the house on my ass
Cause you all already know what I stand for
Painting pictures, I'm Van Gogh
Promoters paid like Santro
In the studio wearing sandals
Blowing blue grass, no banjo
Was a hoodlum like Bun B
I'm good son, I'm comfy, like Gandi
But niggers still wanna jump me like bungee cords
So I play my cards smart like Gin Rummy, for
Rappers thats mad cause they can't out rap this country boy!
Plus their bitches want me, you act like ya'll married with kids
Who are you? Al Bundy?
Hit a strip club, fuck a stripper
Without throwing a bill up, that's chauncey
I got a pretty pussy passenger with me
And she ain't wearing no undies
Ha! oh my bad is this your chick up in my front seat?
Obviously she likes being around bread
I call the bitch lunch meat
But I'm tight with your ends like Shiancoe
We tell em' lies, we prank hoes
Got a SunTrust, on wheels, nigga that what I call a bank roll
I reign supreme with the same regime
With killer hooks, my games Kareem
My verse is Kobe, I’ll change my number before I change my team

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, Superhero in the flesh
Even at my worst I'm the best, for the finish I stretch
When they advance me this check
Could've bought my way to heaven, but I blow it on my neck
Instead, what you expect when you ain't have shit
And they ain't paying half of what you asking
Couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie
Now the hoes is down for taking pictures cause you're flashin'
You can't even imagine, maybe Kim Kardashian
Number one song, get a grammy, now I'm smashing
Maserati crashin', swerving through the traffic
Wrap it round a pole, sell a mil off the tragedy
I defy gravity, flyer than I have to be
Talking to the Lord, I can't stay, who gon' save hip-hop after me?
That's like a torn ACL to an athlete
Boobie Miles, Friday Lights, capture me
In my hometown...

Yeah, yeah, it's just Ciroc in the cooler
Not a day off but I'm still Ferris Bueller
Winners never lose so how dare you confuse us
They quote what I spit like Confucius
He say, She say rumors all day
The rap game is high school and life's a hallway
Like what click you in, the Beamer or the Benz
The Bentley or the Lambo, like here we going again
Don't sit at my table, V-I-P I got this
You ain't poppin champagne after every game then don't pop shit
Homecoming queen, with my picture in her locket
But I know what's up with her hands in my pockets
They love me cause my swag is so jockish
Freshman year I saw a ring like I'm boxin'
You voted most likely to never ever top this
I Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodmans
In my hometown...[Verse 1 - Big K.R.I.T.]
A superhero in the flesh
Even at my worst, I'm the best
For the finish, I stretch
When they advance me this check
Coulda bought my way to heaven but I blow it on my neck instead
What you expect when you ain't have shit
And they ain't paying half of what you asking
Couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie
Lot of hoes are down for taking pictures cause you're flashy
You can't even imagine, maybe Kim Kardashian
Number one song and a Grammy, now I'm smashing
Maserati crashing, swerving through the traffic
Wrap it 'round a pole, sell a mil off the tragedy
I defy gravity, flyer than I have to be
Talking to the Lord, "I can't stay, who gon' save hip hop after me?"
It's like a torn ACL to an athlete, Boobie Miles, Friday Lights, capture me
In my hometown

[Hook]
King city, K-King city ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping lean (memories are fresh)
King city, K-King city ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping lean (ooh, the people I've met)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of this world)
King City, M-Town, Hometown Hero (are the wonders and now)

[Verse 2 - Yelawolf]
Alabama homie, I wear it like a hat
I'm a small town boy, I'm so proud of that
Some people leave it, they fall til they fall flat
I just wanna bring it home, and give it all back
Cause given all that, what's been given to me
A successful rapper, huh?, I might as well hit the lottery
So instead of becoming a diamond-wearing novelty
I rock beads and buy my mama some property
Tell the white boys in the pick up truck that Yelawolf is coming home
For the Chevrolet dunkriders in the projects and the trailer park zones
You might've seen my face in a couple pages in the XXL
But if I can't walk around in my own neighborhood, then leave that shit on the shelf
Took the keys to the old Chevelle, cause if I'm in a boat by myself
Then everything I catch will go bad, see all I wanna do is share
Give it away, give it away, everybody come take what you can hold now
Gadsden, I love you, lemme introduce the world to my hometown

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Big K.R.I.T.]
It's just Ciroc in the cooler
Not a day off, but I'm still Ferris Bueller
Winners never lose, so how dare you confuse us
They quote what I spit like Confucius
He say, she say, rumors all day
The rap game is high school, and life's a hallway
Like what clique you in
The Beamer or the Benz
The Bentley or the Lambo
Like here we go again
Don't sit at my table
VIP, I got this
If you ain't popping champagne after every game then don't pop shit
Homecoming queen with my picture in her locket
But I know what's up with her hands in my pockets
They love me cause my swag is so jock-ish
Freshman year, saw a ring like I'm boxing
You voted most likely to never ever top this
I'm Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman
In my hometown

[Hook][Verse 1]
Hey, I'm back like I never left, spit to 'em
The realer you are, the quicker you get to 'em
Why front when you can't back it?
Get dough off of blow, but you can't stack it
Something like David Blaine, I got that street magic
When the coast is clear, watch it disappear
Never been a fuckboy, nigga I ain't fakin'
I'm a man of God, so they gon' hate
A lot of forks in the road got me thinking about tomorrow
When they see you moving up, yeah, they push you horizontal
Music is an ocean full of sharks and piranhas
A couple of octopussies here and all the crabs at the bottom
If you know like I know, I hide amongst that core
Where hip-hop is still alive and rappers still have morals
Based on the game, they saying, "we won't change"
Like, the South just booty and we ain't got no brain
Fuck that, my nigga, I spit crucial
That Cranberry juice, my shit, it go through ya
To get respect from Mississippi is a dream
If it means my death, I'll take one for the team
No blinking, no hesitation, I'm only me, I ain't one to do imitations
I am one to be motivated to get cheddar
I'll never be comfy knowing that I can do better
Not your typical Southern rapper, am I?
Got the whole 3rd coast still on stand by
You get nailed down here playing with hammers
Hey, the world is yours like Tony Montana
You ain't got the types of gifts I got
New Chevy on deuce-deuce, that's the malox box
Get me in a custom (?) ho
If one don't get her done, shawty I know plenty mo'
Pretty pros, pretty faces, and they pretty toes
Pretty eyes, pretty mouths, and they pretty throats[Intro]

Really some bitch niggas, claiming it's going down
How 'bout them busty chicks?
How 'bout them stripper poles?
How 'bout them church girls who love to wear stripper clothes?
How 'bout she keep it shaking until she get bucket naked?
How 'bout she make a dollar and stop the procrastination?
How 'bout I been a king?
Lord of the gold rings
Really, I thought you knew
They nicknamed me high king
How about I make a note
To never ever going broke
Grabbed the [?] by it's throat
And never ever let it go

Just look at my wrist
Aye, how 'bout that paper?
How 'bout my car?
I bought these diamond dancing like a motherfucking [?]
How 'bout that money?
I just smoked a onion
They asked me how I did it
Cause my city, I run it
Fell in love with your bitch
Cause her head was ironic
She get me sloppy really fast so I call her supersonic
You either sellin' dope or pimpin' bitches where I'm from
Live by the gun, die by the gun
Competition with myself and I already won
They get money a long time, they got a nigga sprung

How 'bout you keep it real?
How 'bout you make a move?
How 'bout you play the game?
How 'bout you pay some dues?
How 'bout you quit begging, and get off yo mama couch?
Way too much money to still be living at yo mama house
How 'bout you stop flexing?
Knowing your bills due
Stop with them sad stories
Nobody feels you
How 'bout you pay attention and peep how they do the pole?
Watch for them dirty laws, they kill you for being poor
How 'bout you get a buck?
Flip it and level up
Stack it and stack some more
Cause one stack just ain't enough
How 'bout I teach you class
You study, you have to pass
Pimping like 101

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Fuck what you heard, ho, they know bout the Krizzle
The Chevy on four Pirellis with the pole in the middle
I break a ho if she brittle, pimpin' hot off the griddle
Cluckin' bustas freakin' and fuckin' for nothing
So how you figure I was tricking off?
Candy paint my Caddy frame don't be ashamed to lick it off
Hail Mary some game to a dame and you can't pick it off
Off the chain (Hoo!) I can't sic it off
Time and time again I try and tell them let me kick it off
And bang on it, I put these lames on it
It ain't Multi if ain't put my name on it
Make that kinda track and put a train on it
Styrofoam, purple rain on it
Fresh up out the cleaners, my demeanor, not a stain on it
Reign on it, put some chains on it, bet the game on it
My woofer beat to the frequency that a bitch done came on it
Pinky ring on em, chinchilla get hanged on the floor
I leave a bitch fiending for some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big SANT]
Yeah, B-izza G SANT, biatch
Young trill nigga, ho you know just what I be bout
Time to take off them T tops, we on that, like banners
Man hold up, my car older than your favorite rapper
This that shit that they should capture on film
Lights camera action, life
Bitch my pimpin' 1080p, without a satellite
Why niggas ain't acting right, talkin' 'bout who run the South
They know it's us
They sick and ain't no Robituss to help ‘em out
I been official, big dawg in the yard
Voted most likely to murder every verse that I start
So as soon as I park and I hop on that ride
Better leave with your bitch, 'fore I'm off in her mouth
Cuz I'mma big timer rhymer, no co-signers around for you
If I ain't make that clear let me break it down for ya
They lame (yeah), we not (yeah), see us (yeah) on top (yeah)
Alumni forever ever bitch
They know

[Hook][Hook:]
Hey how you feel?
I feel like money, I feel like money
'Bout 100 mil, stacked by the bundles
Brown paper bag, some rubberbands
Defines work, rap with some (?)

[Verse 1:]
I feel like money, I feel like rich
I feel like wealth, I am the shit
Like 50 felt, 'bout 100 mil
No water bottles, a major deal
Just raw emotion, that's pure adrenaline
Blow stacks in the club like I had a million
I blow a trick, can't call it stuntin'
I'm just being me, and that's being money

[Interlude:]
Hey hold up Infamous, it's your boy Big KRIT, run that shit back for me cuh

[Hook:]

[Verse 1 replayed:]

[Verse 2:]
And that's being honest, I help my conscious
Live for this paper, these niggas zombies
These niggas, frontin', wrapped up like a mummy
They don't feel like you, cause you feel like money

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I feel like money, straight off the shelf
I ain't no virgin shawdy, I ain't savin' shit
I feel like spending, life's a shopping spree
I got a horrible habit, buy everything I see
And everything I be, and everything I love
And everything I am, in God I trust
A pussy nigga, I swear to God I crush
I make that money that my palm can't clutch
I'm on my shit, you on your last
You want this paper? You gon' get this cash (?)
It's all or nothing, these haters fuck 'em
They don't feel like me cause I feel like money

[Hook:]

[Verse 4:]
I feel like Kobe, top of my game
16-0, a Patriot thing
American dreaming, my road to redemption
My message is clear, broke nigga just listen
I'm Jordan, they Pippen
My destiny written
My mind-frame makes me, the richest man living
That's just my opinion
Who gonna tell me different?
If you feel like money, shawdy fuck with me

[Hook:][All bars: Big KRIT]

I got a thing for this rap shit
Get money mad shit
Look at how they maxed me
Whats happening
On some super hero shit
In the city of villains
Well for a fee between you and me, niggas is killing
NARC's dirty like roaches usually they sellin'
Never had a heart growing up usually he tellin'
Saw that nigga never spoke to him, for a good reason
In class poppin' off, used to say I was cheatin'
I keep my business on the low, convos to the minimum
You ain't ever heard of money bags, while I'm in to them
Make moves and break rules, fuck bendin' em
Might haul off and swing on a nigga like a pendulum
Stick to the code little man that's what they told me
O.G.'s that did they time like fuck the police
Never trust a soul when you get this dough
Seen best friends turn to foes and jump ship like hoes
I see it clearly now, I'm on my grizzly now
Might have to maul me a nigga with the semi now
Sniper shit 50 cal yea, get away clean boss
Concentrate calculate and knock ya head clean off
I don't need you to love me nigga
Probably mad cuz your bitch want to fuck me nigga
At my show, front row trynna touch me nigga
Down to fuck she gave it up you be her hubby nigga
I'm on some pimp shit, no can't limp shit
Tell her, her pet name, bring me that bread "bitch"
No I tease on the track, watch how I sketch this
A master piece so accurately a hustler's profession
No half way all in, nigga I'm ballin'
Jim Jones hoes with a lambo I crawl in
Maybach that's right more ice than a half pipe
I must of been King tucked somewhere in my past life
Hold up, roll up, that good take a slow puff
That last drag of purp we smoke that sho nuff
I ain't trippin on beef
Over cheese if its cold cut
Take a block with a hole and dig till its sowed up
Yeah young Krizzle[Hook]
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Since I, since I felt this way
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Since I, since I felt this way
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Since I, since I felt this way
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got, got me, got me

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Thunder cracking, another day to be chilling
Nothing to do but roll up and po' up and catch that feeling I had
Back when I was younger, used to bum from my partner's uncle
Had that smoke that smelled like dumpster
Something missing, I'm way too high to talk my pimping
So I sip my Remy, that's when I first got tunnel vision
Yea I saw it clearly, sunshine never shine like this
When I was sober off in the ? I never rhymed like this
I think I'm tripping, no I'm high, no I'm throwed
Well all I know is that my world is super slow
I like this better, light as a feather, too fly to land
Too throwed to drive in this weather
I'm hydroplaning

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
It's getting harder to explain the way I feel when I'm zoned
High as fuck, money stuck so don't call my phone
See I was young when I was tipping, but I wasn't tripping though
Perfect combination of elevation had me tipping slow
Fall asleep while we ride, cloud surf to my house
I never knew the strength of the drink until I melt away in my couch
And dream about the things I never had and all the places I couldn't go
Tried to play it cool around my folk but I was fucked up on the low
Eyes bloodshot red, can't get to my bed
Cup of lean in my stomach, ounce of smoke in my head
I ain't been this way in a while, it's cool, I need to relieve the stress
With all of the worries of this life, I blew it out my chest
I'm hydroplaning

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
Tryna hold on
But I'm steady getting higher as the sweet meets the fire again
Round 10, toe to toe with the green
See me I'm bobbing and weaving but he's choking me and cheating mane
Tryna train my lungs, to hang
Cause I'm gonna be smoking 'til Kingdom Come
Sang the songs that chose to make people roll up the mota
(And feel good like they supposed ta)
Wanna stay grounded but somehow gravity pulls me up
Am I upside down? Man what the fuck
Going on mane, hydroplaning
As I'm going up, not going insane but
Out of control, feel like it's out of my hands
Let me grab a hold before I crash land
Because it's like I'm going crazy, hydroplaning
I'm hydroplaning![Verse 1:]
I ain't gonna play wit 'em
Hey baby, Young Krizzle baby, Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
Been on my paper chase, no question I'm ballin' out
Purple labels and red, poppin' bottles and tag
Couldn't get you without it, but with a funny (?)
Modifying my swag, overdosing the flow
That KRIT blow get you gone, your ass gonna drip in snow
Fresher than fresh would know, I rap professional
Been in the game too long, how dare you say I'm next to blow
More like I'm the next to be king the king of those who think they dope
Swear they hot, swear they fire, swear they can't fuck with me though
But you can tell them I say, fuck I tell 'em I said
Your favorite rapper, favorite rapper, I think that I'm better

[Hook:]
I ain't gone play with 'em, I ain't gone play with 'em, naaaahhh
I ain't gone play with 'em, I ain't gone play with 'em
Buck said don't play with 'em, (?) said don't play with 'em, naaaahhh
I ain't gone play with 'em, I ain't gone play with 'em
I ain't gone play with 'em

[Bridge:]
I bought this beat, I'm cheatah (?)
(?) my dream, they cannot kill me, it is in my dream
I ain't gone play with 'em

[Verse 2:]
Alright, give me the beat, I cease to repeat
My flow so elite, raised to deceased
Kill competition, bomb my opposition
Like insurgents, I'm urgin' to blow up in the street
You ain't never seen what I bring to the game
Hol' new swag, hol' new slang
Cause (?)
Niggas just call me on trizzaine (?)
I fresh out the trap, scared on lap (?)
But baby they ain't even know I can rap
Hands off the strength, I am a pimp
Been to the game to sit on the bench
Be on the bench when I am the coach
I kick you off because you're not a pro
I will retire, you will get higher
I'mma come back and put you on smoke
Fuck what you niggas think, fuck what you niggas say
I'm gonna get money as long as I'm lizzide (?)
Pull along sizzide (?)
You and your chick, the kind that gonna ask her is she gonna rizzide?
Krizzle, seven-four, fizzile (?) cause I spit that truth, how could I lizzie?
Born a king, been a king, be a king, stay a king, act as one until I dizzie

[Hook:][Verse 1]
I'm talkin' 500 degrees straight out the coup
With some boppers in my ride and they head out the hood
In the hood I finally recognize the K and the truth
Before I die I promise I have my name on some shoes
No one sayin' what you usually get
I'm fresh off the dome, I ain't used to this shit
But the niggas out to fly like a bird since I've been on the curb
I only had one thing that's my balls and my word
Set a standard went to Atlanta with my crew
He my eyes and my ears but down here I proach
Down here I crush anyone in the face
What if their backs turn fuck it anyone replace
If I said it I meant what I did what I done
Kick ass (?) without using my guns
Without using my lungs, I still will make mils
I could die motherfucker, and I still will get deals

[Hook]
I ain't playin' with you niggas no more
That 44 get 'em make you hit the floor
And if you want it you can get it at the door
If it ain't about money stop talkin' to me hoes


[Verse 2]
Oh shit I did it again, ay hold up
Niggas got a problem with K, you best fold up
I ain't got time to play with no hoes
Unless they coming right off the track with my dough
A pimps ID's broke, I don't need it
Me not gettin' the deal, I can't see it
Fuck them niggas, I know they don't like me
And if they got a problem with Krizzle, they come fight me
Why a fuck nigga? they know they don't last
I don't care I conk ya are you don't pass
Queen city bomb, I'm known for that ?
My one goal, gettin' that dough, watch me (?)
I ain't got problem with these niggas
Stop motherfucking cock blockin' me, niggas
And let's make something clear
I ain't never quit once in my life I touchdown each year

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And one more thing, I never need a clique to be hard
I'm six foot but something else make me lord
Creep bitch hard (?)
Just to see what I got what I got in my garage
No peakin', but this weekend I'm freakin'
Somethin' I can cut and nonchalantly leave it
Never been a type of trick, no bitch
But I get that bit, and I trick that bitch
Move over, KRIT got something to say
He was alive last week but he's dead today
I ain't got time to play with yo
Baby sit ya, fuck nigga, I'm sayin' to you
Don't be talkin' that pop trunk cause I go and pop trunk
If you sleepin' with your bitch ? something your headlong
This nigga's scared huh? that they don't wanna ? you
And that cute ? Mississippi

[Hook][Intro]
"Go on get out of here with you goddamn philosophies and your judgments... Who the hell do you think you are?.. You are Loser, you ain't shit...You're a goddamn ??!!"

[Verse 1]
Ok not a moment to waste, taste the hunger on my breath
I heard somewhere that stress was bad for my health
I ain't dead yet, pathetic maybe, my girl shady
Say I ain't stable, so she don't wanna have my baby
It's kinda crazy, Indeed she feels he'll be
A mothafuckin' threat like me, why not? I ain't that bad
My playa pizzazz was good enough to flip, smack and fuck her ass
But I think I'll pass on the goo goos and gah gahs
Rather fuck hoes that shake they ass like maracas
I think, she think I'm no good, got it from her mama
She always starting some shit, I think that bitch is drama
We never get along 'til I'm pulling on her thong
While I'm digging in her skin, ask me "why I do her wrong?"
C'mon love let's do it one more time
You bound to get yours so I gots to get mine
Sing her a lullaby in the sheets, so that ass can go to sleep
While I plot and creep on paying rent this week
Might have to slang some dick to this lonely chick
Got a Benz, kinda fat, but she got big tits

(chorus)
I ain't shit
I think they wanna see me fail, laid out, played out fulla shells
Man I ain't shit
I'm hollering fuck a job for real, I think I might rob and steal
Man I ain't shit
Shawty homegirl like "leave that dude," why she trippin'? I fucked her too
Man I ain't shit
I'm out here on my last dime, I think I play Xbox to pass time
I ain't shit

[Verse 2]
All I got is dreams of cream and mad green
Smoke 'til I pass out, live life supreme
Cartier frame Polo no stain
Still keep that heater underneath the woodgrain
Puerto Rican mamis that massage my body
Feed me fruit, suck me off in groups, call me papi
I was playa loungin', champagne drinkin'
Another hour woke up, fuck wishful thinking
Eyes full of crust, roll the blunt, shower up
Burn it down, what now call my nigga Buck
Asked him "What's the move?", Tell me what's the play?
I'm dowm for the caper just tell me where they stay
The ski mask way, never beg a borrow
If it go good today do the same shit tomorrow
For real, Fuck what you think that's how it is
Plotting on robbing niggas while I'm watching Cribs, I ain't shit![Hook - Big K.R.I.T.][x2]
I run my city, I’m an arrogant nigga
I run my city, I’m an arrogant nigga
You say I’m tight, I’m like I already know
You think I’m tight, I’m like I already know

[Verse 1 – Big K.R.I.T.]
At the bottom cause it ain’t for a g
Like my music ain’t been bumping since 2003
Like I ain’t been one of the realest that spits for the gangstas
The pimps, hustlers, and trappers, and the boys with them swangers
A-1 strapped up, lean in my cup
Lames hating on the K but I don’t give a fuck
Move wit it, jig wit it if you gots to
[?] love me and they dig me so they gon to
What it is ho? What it look like?
I got that crick crack shawty and it’s whipped right
Boys think I’m playing just because I ripped the beat
Even [?] know that killer K will wreck a beat
I been affiliated ever since Mr. C
I was round here, big down here, hustling off in these streets
So you can miss me with that rap shit partner
Cause when shit hit the fan my folk resort to them choppers

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 - ?]
We’ll take the compliment, I know I’m the talk of the town
Wherever I hang around, that’s where it’s going down
Best believe it, I ain’t conceited, I’m confident
I don’t need to keep the heater with me but it compliments
My gangsta, so toughland don’t tough it out
Turn a ruthless nigga to a buster when I bust it out
Leave a nigga laying in some lean with his face flat
Just cause he was playing when I ain’t playing, nigga take that
And that’s that, understand I’m a Jackson
Egghead nigga think he hard but I cracked him
Wonder why I holler “I’m the best” and the scene drop
When I spit at they team, they whole self-esteem drop
Now he all humble, walking round with his tail tucked
Yeah he comfortable now, but I can make it hell bruh
He ain’t wanna fight, he just saying what he could of done
I got some advice for you, duck when the bullet come

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 3 – Big K.R.I.T.]
Word is killer K about to infiltrate the game
Cause everywhere you go you hear a player say his name
I got the hood jumping, we set the streets on fire
Ay it’s a wrap, even Tad screaming more tired
Here I am, long awaited with another one
Did one that was banging, J Obie got another one
King of the queen, that’s a hell of a title to call myself
But I done proved that a thousand times and nothing else

[Verse 4 - ?]
Standing ovation, Deezy said it best
I sleep when I die, so ain’t no need in getting rest
Bet I’m up tired, that’s such an easy investment
I stand on it till the day that I stand corrected
See I’m the best you done seen in a long time
I keep a fresh book so now I got a strong mind
I miss the heat, this the AK get a best seller
Stack my paper higher than the ceiling, ask my bank teller

[Hook][x4][Hook]
It's gone be nights I ain't coming home
Some days you can't reach me on my phones
It's gone be shawtys that claimed we kicked it
When I was out on the road, tryna handle my business
I know I can't make it up with shopping sprees
Cause money can't buy you all the things you need
But baby girl you got to trust me,  try to understand
I do the best I can, and I apologize in advance

[Verse 1]
My homeboys tell me I ain't sane
To leave you at the crib, just to try to chase this game
Baby girl, I'm trying to do better
Cause we gone go do better
If I ain't go do better  for us
I can't talk right now, cause they charging by the hour
I'm at the io
Yeah, but did you get them flowers that I sent to you
For being there and sticking by your man
These snakes is running game, but they ain't getting by your man
So stop it, keep it hot for me
And all that love that we had
When we first met, I hope that it don't stop for me
I think this rap about to pop for me
So if I can get you that house you wanted, that car
And hell, I'll even let you shop for me
Tell your folk they ain't gotta trip
Cause when they hear my music
Shawty, yo we out here
And all them dreams and themes we had can come true
All the mistakes I made in the past, I undo

[Hook]
It's gone be nights I ain't coming home
Some days you can't reach me on my phones

Cause money can't buy you all the things you need
But baby girl you got to trust me,  try to understand
I do the best I can, and I apologize in advance

[Verse 2]
I know you really want your homie back
But you gone see that your family say I'm gone leave you
Once I made it, I can hear that doubtin' in your voice
And yeah I hate it, I'm coming home soon shawty
So just be patient
And we gone kick it like we never kicked it
And that's a bet
We gone live like the happy live, with no regrets
So stay down, I know just how we play round
And when you (?) when we lay down
When I hit this road, and rock all of these shows
I can look you in the eyes and know you still love me
And when I come back home
And take you to this house that the rap game bought
I know you proud of me
And I ain't saying that we ain't about to go through it
With the magazines, tabloids, haters and the rumors
But yet, I'm just a man
I hope you understand, that this gone be hard
I'm sorry in advance

[Hook]
It's gone be nights I ain't coming home
Some days you can't reach me on my phones
It's gone be shawtys that claimed we kicked it

But baby girl you got to trust me, try to understand
I do the best I can, and I apologize in advance

[Verse 3]
Yeah the money won't phase me, you still be my lady
Don't worry bout them shawtys when they talking all crazy
When I'm done with this, yeah we can start a family
You be there by my side when we hit it to the Grammy's
The Maybach with the chauffeur
Red carpet when we roll up
The doors on the whip like wings, they just roll up
You always kept me focused
That why I hope you closest
I did it all for us
And I'm hoping that you noticed

[Hook]
It's gone be nights I ain't coming home
Some days you can't reach me on my phones
It's gone be shawtys that claimed we kicked it

Cause money can't buy you all the things you need
But baby girl you got to trust me, try to understand
I do the best I can, and I apologize in advance[Intro: Melanie Fiona]
A, will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Yea, I gave my all

[Verse 1: Big Krit]
Cheah, aye I'm a man so I stand on my own two
I give a damn about a hater and his whole crew
No jump shot so I'm selling crack
To tell you the truth, I've been to Hell and back
No food in the kitchen so I'm scrapin' scraps
Tightest nigga in the world can't afford to rap
Now I'm on the hunt for a nigga to jack
Soon as I get rich I swear I'm givin' it back
It's cold out here, you gotta hold your own
I never knew what pain was until I was grown
I never miss my home boy until he was gone
But life goes on
So if I call

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
If I fall by the river bed
Would you save me or leave me dead?
All the blood I shed
And I'll just rest my head

[Verse 2: Big Krit]
Cheah, ain't nothin' easy 'bout the life I chose
Wasn't much of a choice, just the life I know
Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor just to kill time
When I'm fucked up, the only time I feel fine
Mama say I'm lettin' life go by
As if I ain't grindin', as if I don't try
But you can see in the eyes, she worry 'bout her baby
Late night, scared a nigga might play me
Police in the street don’t phase me
Get it how you live let em chase me
Bills still due, yea I can't stall
But that ain't all
So if I call

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Krit]
Cheah, I used to love 'er, I used to hold 'er
She made me promise I'd never let 'er go
She made me smile, could've had my child
I held her tight like I never held before
But things change when you get older
She started drinkin' cause I ain't sober
That's when I told 'er
"Be careful 'bout the friends you keep
Cause the ones you call friends ain't friends to me"
Now we don't see eye to eye
The more I tell her the truth, the more she lies
The more we shoot each other down, the more we die
I think it's best that I said goodbye
So when I call

[Hook][Intro (Talking)]
You can mourn for me baby, life goes on
Try not to cry too much
I'll see you again so...

[Verse 1]
If I should die from this rap shit
On a plane to a show for the masses
The media will say "it's oh so tragic"
A king lost, shed tears for my passin'
Remember I was happy here that's what I'm askin'
When I was with ya, yeah, you always kept me laughin
Forgive me for the plans we never made
And all the things I wish I could but I never say
I hope God overlook the days I never prayed
And embrace a sudden loss if I'm never saved
And even though it be far far before my time
I can say I lived life
If I should die

[Hook]
It be far far before my time
I mean far far before my time
But I won't doubt ya
Because I've known ya

[Verse 2]
If I should die
Mind I never wanted to leave
Let the niggas in the hood throw a party for me
Smoke good, drink good, blow something my way
Don't trip, dry your eyes, just keep yo faith
And let the hoes that I used to know from way before
Kiss me from my head to my toes
Give me some paper and pens
So I can write about the world
The child that I never had and my favorite girl
No legacy on my own but I did what I could
Never liked saying goodbyes
But I know that I should
Even though It be far before my time
Just know that I'm fine
If I should die

[Hook]
It be far far before my time
I mean far far before my time
But I won't doubt ya
Because I've known ya

[Verse 3]
If I should die
Just know that I went out in a blaze
From some hater plotting to kill me
Cause he know that I'm paid
Tell my niggas hold your horses, don't kill pimpin'
I forgive him, you should too, let God deal with him
Anytime you see the purpose of mercy
No weapon formed against me on earth shall hurt me
Yeah heaven's right in front of me, I'm hoping I'm worthy
All I have is faith, Lord I can't be certain
What my future holds
Or where will I go when I exit this vessel
And these brown eyes close
Even though it be far far before my time
I can say I tried
If I should die

[Hook]
It be far far before my time
I mean far far before my time
But I won't doubt ya
Because I've known ya[Hook:]
I told her you should go home
It's better that way
I wish I could come with you
But I got to stay, but I got to stay

[Verse 1:]
All aboard I heard them call your name
I knew you got your ticket now you're on your way
And it was hard to watch you wave goodbye
I write you here and there with no need to reply
It's just I lost a good friend in a time of need
Like forever would be better but this time your free
Hate you left us kind of selfish just to think that way
You going home don't worry what you probably would say
But yeah it hurts I smile at the thought of
You At peace in your mind, no longer ache in your heart
Finish and start, rise with the sun
Finally hear your father say servant well done
I strive to be half of what you was
I'm just hoping that I can carry on your love
And I regret all the times I had to leave you
I promise I'mma see you when I see you

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Your motherly hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Played the tambourine so well
Reminiscing on my granddaddy, shed tears as you looked at his pictures on the shelf
Phone ringing everyday, friends gone away
Wishing you could go, but you had to stay
I sit and cried with you
Soon the fellings of the past aware, one day that you pack your bags
Turn to me and ask don't fret when I leave
This earthly body of mine done did all of its deeds
Crawled till it walked and held all it could breathe
Carry on what I taught you was given thru he
To you from me, in times like this believe
I got a call like you used to get just the other day, they told me you'd gone home to stay

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
Now I know what you meant when you used to say
If I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away, I'd fly away
Lord, if I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away,I'd fly away

[Hook:][Hook]
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
Big backyard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims

[Bridge]
Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes

[Verse 1]
Well I suppose niggas gon' hate on me
Well that's cool
I got shows, getting money I can barely fold
Cause that's what I do
And ain't nobody gon' pimp K-R-I-T
Yea, that's how I feel
And them diamonds niggas always rhyming 'bout
Pressed against my wheel
And ain't nobody gon' check none of me or mine
In God I trust
If you think I'm out here tricking these hoes
You got me fucked up
And ain't no playing in the south, turn a bad bitch out
When I grab my pipes
Y'all niggas think this shit came oh so easy
It wasn't over night, but

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Now I suppose I'm doing quite alright
Ever since I blew
Don’t be worryin' bout me an don’t worry bout mine, player
Worry about you
And ain't nobody gon' block my shine today
With the roof gone
I got a top notch bitch, you need something like this
But you gotta get your own
And ain't nobody gon' wreck this hard
When I'm traveling down the boulevard
Now they hollering out "Oh my God!"
Cause they never seen rims this large
"That's country shit"
Well that's cool cause I'm country, bitch
I never turn my back, I burn on wax
And stack my cash 'til I'm country rich, cause

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I got this here, I got this here
Chevys on that chrome
Live and in my zone
'Til a player gone
I got this here, I got this here
Doing it how I feel
Doors open for hoes
Haters in my grill
I got this here, I got this here
Diamond in the back
Slamming on these doors
Trunk beat 'til it crack
I got this here, I got this here
Get it how I live
Smoking on that good
Cracking on my seal

[Hook]

[Bridge][Hook]
I done heard it all before
Yea you jamming, but yo image need some guidance
And some diamonds cause it's more to this than rhyming
Yea I done heard it all before
We'll be travelling and flying state to state
Fucking hoes, rocking shows if you sign
Ay I done heard it all before
Ay in this game, what you claim ain't the thang
Mississippi ain't for fame, change yo name
Yea I done heard it all before
But yo talent is by far a blessing
And a gift from God but we can turn you into a star
Ay I done heard it all before

[Verse 1]
Never losing in pursuing in my vision
In my kitchen writing rhymes, pray to God that they listen
But it's a real fucked up position that this rap shit might just put you in
My partner fed up with the game, like he might sell that kush again
Cause CDs we been pushing them, but deals ain't coming fast enough
We he need to go feed his kids and this shit here ain't adding up
Passing us by, time, never waste, busy home
Sit beside by grandma, wish that I can stay
The phone ringing, promises so confident of money plays
I head back to the struggle like "they might sign me any day"
Forever trapped, no coming back, addiction's truly hard to break
A thousand pills could never fill the gap of leaving off the stage

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I pride myself on being righteous, do it big and do it better
But A&R's ain't in the streets, I'm forced to follow them on Twitter
I'm painting pictures, ghetto compositions, living work of art
But dancing in a circle dressed as Urkel how you make your mark
Ay get yo star, play yo part, find yo swag, get yo deal
So you snapping, who needs rapping when you got some ad-libs?
And some days there's no choice, most days it's hard times
If skinny jeans mean big dreams, no thanks I'm just fine
In my mind, it's 'bout rhyme, I'm just tryna speak freely
My shawty feel illuminati's real and they might kill me
For voicing my opinion, scared to die but this ain't living
In these meetings they can't tell me what I'm missing

[Hook][Intro]
Feel like I shoulda put a grill in for this one

[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
They hollerin', "Krizzle, where you been?"
I been outchea on it
Studio going
Kicking and flowing
3 in the morning
Trying to make something worth it cuz most this rap shit ain't working
Im fully focused on clowning these clowning clowns for the circus
Ugh
Im just trying to ride to city I ain't never been
And get that club appearance money that’s too much to spend
And buy another old school and sit it on some rims
And hit the nearest KOD and throw it in the wind
Hell it was tax free
Ill blow all that shit before they tax me
The ticket for today that other ticket last week
We talking prices you don’t like then don’t ask me
Cuz every time I kick a verse the price go higher and higher
I make a beat and rap on it that’s like fire to fire
When most these lames was in they feelings I was rotating tires
Selling country shit when the label said that they wouldn’t buy it
Like why would you deny it?
Them niggas get livest when I get on my live shit I might start a riot
Despite my empire you act like im lying
I'm among the top 5 bitch and wasn’t even trying
Ugh
They drop the ball all they want and ima pick it up, windmill, 360, behind the back but that just ain't enough
I'm left to shoot the shot one on the clock
I'm living for the clutch
A nigga that don’t understand the game someone that I can't trust
A hoe that's down to fuck for fame a hoe that I can't fuck
When you king Midas with the flow some shit you just can't touch
Gold twankies im out here swanging on these hoes
Multi be the gang im outchea banging on these hoes
No half stepping Big Daddy Kaning on these hoes
Mo money mo money I'm Daymond Wayans on these hoes
For the 2000s
Ima buy what I want while you browsing
We set the standard higher than a giant standing on two mountains
I built my ship to ride the wave im like who drowning?
Now days the bag of hot potatoes my nigga like you counting
Too much, wrist hurtin, how much? ain't certain?
Gotta break it down use the money counter and watch out for these niggas lurking
This crack the house spittin dollas in the game got these bitches twerking
Multi till the sun die
Bitch 12 for 12 with these verses

[Outro]
Krizzle, Krizzle
Let's go[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
Still tippy toeing old school caddy doorin'
Country boy ain't way too hot in here
Shit I been hot for years
Swimming through the trenches
Roaches in yo kitchen
Peeking out the window
Doing dishes
Who that is they look suspicious?
Cutting through the yard
Trying to make a living
Now its workers in the field
Bald faded when they trim it
Line it up to the tippy top
With a bitch that love shining
Knob like she missed a spot
You would think she missed a lot
Im just tryina whip this money till it hurt
I remember every face that used to say this wouldn't work
To a dreamer that’s like non believers talking to a church
Used to people looking down on me
I come from the dirt
I come from a place where people always have to stick together
Pillow talking with the hoes the only time you ruffle feathers
Trying not to worry bout these haters and business ventures
Easter Sunday penny loafers last time I penny pinch
Like fuck them niggas
We gon ball in the skylight
Don’t worry if you missed the game
We got highlights
Free agent on the court
I know my score and what im worth
Im not sure what all these niggas getting
But you pay me first
We just on it tho
Now days the rap game a junkie
In a corner store
Whole lot of hand outs
I used to know
I used to go to studios
I used to flow
Remember ol buddy that was buzzin
You too young but I know you know
Bitch, no I don’t
Took a song with mutli to the fullest
A chopper with the product in the booth
Im sweating bullets
Life’s a gamble
This a slot machine
Ima pull it
I got steak I got shrimp I got lobster
What you cooking?
3 mins they got 45 left
Who you booking
Yeah that one song killed then it died
I was looking
Catalogue mean mazing
A whole lotta rookies
Striped-badges girls scouting niggas
Whole lotta cookies
Ain't no need to write a verse
A whole lotta hooking
Rap game was a parent
There's a whole lotta whoopin's
Ain't no time outs
Write your name 100 times and sign out
More like suck that shit up right now
What you crying bout
You the sub of the sub of the sub of the sub
That ain't start
Why you trying out?
Why I gotta be the only one that see it clearly?
Maybe outside looking in means you come from Mississippi
Hold up
Maybe outside looking in means you come from Mississippi
Hold up
My nigga like "Goddamn, why you stop?"
...Looking in means you come from Mississippi, Krizzle[Intro:]
Hey lets get it nigga
It's all my street nigga, man this shit so soulful nigga
I feel (?) some shit like this, yea I know it's the mixtape and all nigga
But they gotta keep it real (?) know what I'm saying?

[Hook:]
I just touched down (touched down)
Aye what it is shawty (yeah)

Aye what it is shawty (yeah)

Just-just j-just-just j-just down
I just-just j-just-just j-just...

[Verse 1:]
I just touched down in my city on chrome
Working wood wheel from a yella gettin' dome
Gators on my toes, love how I'm livin'
Aye tell me what I'm doing if I ain't fuckin' pimpin'
I had some major setbacks but I'm still grindin'
Haters love to see me down but I'm still shinin'
Motivate the real and the trill to get this dough
I gotta little hustle plus I'm good with my flow
Push it to the max when I steer into a bitch
I tell her get this money, have no love for a trick
It's all about the (?) girl, you gotta be a beast (?)
And can't no ho around my city escape my mouthpiece
I'm something like Golden, call me a mack
I put up on the track and they bring it right back
Cause pimpin' is my child (?) for miles
Still block a (?) I'm a whole professional (?)

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I just got paid, working on a slab
When y'all was watching cartoons I was peeping Shafts
I'm only 18, but I'm feeled by the grown folk
Hit that Bobby Brown but my rapping shit is strong though
Put it in your face, every bar and every line
Feeling cash like Ray (?), I'm a pimp in my mind
King in my rhyme
Fuck you think different?
They call me Saint Nick cause my flow so gifted
I'm still hollin' greater (?) later to my niggas locked up
All them OGs, and soldier (?) fuckin' blocks up
What's the damn deal? Holla at a playa
I hate a bitch, (?) keep walking if it ain't about paper
I'm trill in my field, down like 4 flat (?)
Tires on cutthroat, S-S-R Cadillac
Might have (?) on the syrup I've been sippin'
(?) came out my momma's womb breathing life into this pimpin'

[Hook:][Hook]
It's late but I'm out on the creep
It's been a while since I heard you speak
Hard to rest when I've been on this road
All I want is you next to me because you help me sleep (you help me sleep)
You help me sleep (you help me sleep)
You help me sleep (you help me sleep)
You help me sleep, shawty (sleep, shawty)
I swear it 'bout 4 in the morning
And I'm outchea on it
Trying to fall through just to fuck with you
Well that's if you home, cause you help me sleep (you help me sleep)
You help me sleep (you help me sleep)
You help me sleep (you help me sleep)
You help me sleep, shawty (sleep, shawty)

[Verse 1]
Getting harder and harder to relax, can't rest my back
Gotta be on my P's and my Q's when I roll with this tool in the old school 'Lac
Cause niggas try to jack nowadays in the hood
Those broke niggas up to no good
Get the cup full of drank and I'm filling my tank
Plus I rolled up some of that... ummph!
Sticky-icky, sour, Jolly Rancher candy
Make the bottom of my cup sweet as your punani
Well I'm just joking shawty
I talk about pussy a lot and getting money when I get unfocused shawty
Cause I'm dealing with the pain of the game
And it's getting harder to keep coping shawty
Cause I can't set the world and I showed that, so I hold back
For doing what I can to be a better man forgetting you know that
So we fuss and fight when I'm gone, wasn't right when my wrongs
Almost there won't be long, don't fall asleep on the phone

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you got on, send a pic to my phone
I been out all day tryna make a way for you, hell yeah I'm in the zone
Just eat you out, tell me what that peach about
Feeling good feeling great when I pull off your lace
And ease it in and ease it out
And ease it in again I got to get home, yeah I been drinking
Don't be acting like it don't feel the same, I hear it in your tone
Yeah I was wrong for earlier but baby girl I'm on the way
So keep playing with yourself cause I'm making that left
I'm at the gate, buzz me in, meet me at the door
Body soaking wet, panties on the floor
Yeah I got that, rocked that, beat it 'til it's sore and I knocked that chopped it up
When you suck better sop that up, don't run when it's deep better prop that up

[Hook][Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
A puppet on some strings, she had me gone
Cause even if I was married with kids, no goin' home
She like,  “If you could sleep with an angel between the sheets
Would you give up your beliefs as I proceed to spread my wings?"
I’m like, If it’s good enough, maybe, I guess
I’m no saint I admit, sometimes I fall victim to flesh
I think you worth the regrets
Ifs and the maybes, I'll be down for pleasure
I think you should save it, let me rephrase it
Magic woman, palm reader, to say that you bomb
My records turn, [?]
I know your chakras aligned
The world can't define our spiritual bond
You more than sunshine in the dark

[Bridge: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
Let it shine like gold Put a Spell on you
Forever Baby you wanna say something
She let it shine like gold

[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby in the darkness
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Bridge 2: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
Woa, and I think about you every time na-na
I think about ya every time na-na
Na-nanananana Na-nananana na-na-na-na
Let me see ya baby
Don’t worry bout any of them problems
I can see the light in you baby
In the darkest of dark you are my sunshine
Why don’t you come over
Woa brother, ye-yeah yeah you are my sunshine
Oh my sunshine baby

[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby forever baby
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Hold up I’m trippin'
Smile[Intro: Big KRIT]

I'd like to a, sometimes
Excuse me for being so blunt
It's in my nature, you know

[Big KRIT]

Sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like a hurricane went and formed on me
I swear the teardrops of God feel so warm on me
Well drown me in no more sorrows, hopeless tomorrows
Should have died so long ago I swear my time is borrowed
But give me no shelter, no cheap umbrellas
You'd learn to cherish rain if you came to the desert
A little comfort in the heat of the devil
Rain drop freeze and form ice on my vessel
Frostbit fingertips, frozen cut necklace
No Doppler system or weather man projected this
The storm of the century, monsoon on this industry
Puddles reflect the truth I surely was meant to be
Flash floods in ass clubs, no life jackets for these rappers
On the roof of success but watch 'em pass us
Look for answers in the sky can't trust my pastor
He say whatever in the name to get my cash cause
He hurting just like me, working just like me, uncertain just like me

In The Rain
Yeah I don't like to go out in the rain
In The Rain[Hook:]
I'm paid in full, I paid my dues, I got nothing to lose
(It's a movie baby!)
Yea, Tony was right, if I stay on my grind, the world is mine
(It's a movie baby!)
The block is my stage, I was born for this, like who needs a script?
(It's a movie baby!)
(It's a movie baby!)

[Verse 1:]
Straight out the gate, high speed collision
Pass 8 millimeter, we high definition
One take is all you get, one take is all you got
Don't move out your (?), stay in your spot
The camera makes sure you shot
So on point the man upstairs had to write this plot
So, direct me as he may, in this controversial play
Where the villain gets paid
Everybody doomed, the villain gets saved
Bullets flying, niggas dying, and I only get grazed
The plot thickens, how I'm ticken'
Just sit back, this the beginning

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I'm dreaming of Oscars, and I'm eatin' on pasta
I am a Godfather, and we all the mobsters
And we ball with shottas (?), that's them Kingston Rastas
Donny Brascos catch hoes, crack heads like Lobsters
When you in too deep
Shit don't fall asleep
It's bitch black in the trap, that's the scenery
And your bodies is fallin', cause we wanna be made
Cause power's boss, and the boss is paid
And them people is watchin' and them cameras is rollin'
It's any block near you, this movie is showin'
And I'm known to be focused and I'm classically trained
If you skip through the chapters, I'll be running the game

[Hook:][Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way
Better this way
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play

Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way

[Verse 1]
It’s that, It’s that Krit remind you of that shit
You used to play
In your parents car
Had you feel in as if outer space
Was in your atmosphere
ATLiens all in your ear
Tired of being outcasted
I hope that means you outta here
Nowadays we flex so much
Get a check so much
We never chill
Way to drunk to drive
High as fuck
Plus we poppin pills
Celebrate the very shit
That slow us down and probably kill
Song ain’t even jamming though
Number one in every ville
Got that on repeat
Right before you wake
On your way to work
On your way to church
Stuck in traffic
Right before you go to sleep
I know you tired
Of that overdrive
That commercialized sing along
Wonder why they play this song all the time

[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play

It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way

[Verse 2]
I didn’t know about you till you recognized
It wasn’t paid for or televised by the label
You couldn’t see it all on cable or
Advertised at award shows
I didn't beef with none your favorite rappers
Or drop a sex tape after
Claiming it leaked off of my cellphone
When really I’m tryin' to sell more
And I wouldn’t just say anything
On the radio just to get fame
Or trap it out, gangster rap it out
Knowin' I ain’t never sold a thang
Bust a dime on the coffee table
Really shorty I went to school
I wasn’t friends with the son
Of the executive that ran the label
I had to pay dues
Wasn’t no blueprint where I come from
I couldn’t blow up in the backyard
Couldn’t walk the streets with my Cd
Give it to a DJ, like that's hard
And he play it everyday 'till I got a deal
Album date and advanced tour
My takeover wasn’t overnight
To be honest with you, it was a gift from god

[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play

This is...
Come on, Lucille
Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, goddamn!
Yo Lucille if you don't turn on I'ma leave you out here for these motherfuckers to take!
Fuck it!
I'll get out here on foot, I don't care
I'ma make it to where I need to go
Shit, I'll make it happen,  I'll make it to where I need to go
*Sigh*
That look familiar, I've been that way, and I've seen people go that way
Ooh, I really liked it when I went that way, but I can't do that no more
Mm..
I'ma try this way
Yeah, I'ma do this. I'ma do something different, I'ma go this way[Verse 1]
It was all a dream I used to read Murder Dogg magazine
Wanted to be a dope boy so I could ride clean
Fuck boi ya'll ain't playing no stunts
I went from ashy to classy in only ten months
I'm starting to think I wasn't built for this planet
As a child momma told me I was just too mannish
Lost Annie May in '95 was a hard summer
Miss [?] was like a mother I'd die if I lose another
Ain't been to church in a while so they say I'm vile
Fuck them I still pray and I pay my ties
Besides the only one that roots for me is the Lord
I'm a gladiator baby I'mma die with the sword
If they turn their back on me cause I spoke from my heart
I just pack up my shit and take a trip to Mars
Cause a hustla gonna hustle forever
Since it's hell on Earth I got the nerve to say good bye to the devil

[Hook]
Can I live?
Ya'll niggas don't see my dreams
I hustle all night just to get more cream
Can I live?
Ay papi I need them things
Put crack on the track like habit to the fiends
Can I live?
Drop top Chevy's and coupes
Polo clothes with the polo shoes
Can I live?
Trophies, awards, diamonds, and plagues
It's all good but I need them stacks go and get this crack

[Verse 2]
I just want it in the worst way
Copped my first pair of J's in the 10th grade
Sold some stacks to get games for my PlayStation
Papa never knew about it told him I was saving
Tired of living in the shadow of my brother
Started hanging with some O.G. that told me just be [?]
It's kind of hard to see the light without the darkness
I'm through with excusing niggas and begging bitches pardon
Win or lose young man only time will tell
You'll be surprised how many lames wanna see me fail
Never been secure pimpin' always been a mover
Favorite rapper, favorite rapper, favorite producer
Hey I sleep with my eyes on cause life ain't fair
My friends ain't family and family ain't there
Like BIG I got these Suicidal Thoughts
A couple kush blunts, patron playboy, and a Mo

[Hook][Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
Im on a roll like a rim on a road
Swangers adapting while scraping them fours
Pressing them buttons aww it ain't nun
Nigga popped up the trunk look what it showed
Smooth criminal easing the game
These niggas here is easily lame
Creeping and crawling my TD was falling like woah woah woah
Easy up bang
Chopped up the corner I set out the whip
Spraying with that candy damp in the drip
Underneath the Sunday posing the flip
Bitch I pucker up bout to come up on ya lips
Get out the car like I fell off a cliff
Fondue flow im good with the chips
Old school grind im good with the clips
Turn the club parking lot to the VIP
Hate to make it bout money my nigga, but
It’s about money my nigga, I
Rarely be talking bout balling, but
Ain't like a nigga just getting by
Ain't like a nigga ain't overseas
Top floor, car keys, got chains, got rangs, but I rock these beads
Why not?
When you come up with shit out of thin air its magic
Voila
When I tell a bitch I wanna jump on it she say
How high
I told yall Lebron was gon win that ring
Ah ha
Who the fuck said I wasn’t king?
Bow down
Im two steps and three flights away
Im on the kinda bird that turn night to day
You gotta wait your turn
I got the right of way
I built the castle I live in
You gotta fight to stay
Blood sport, nigga blood sport, this is gladiator shit
Cop my nigga truck to show these lames how a gladiator get it
Im slicker with the flow than a fresh perm and activator kit
After this 12 for 12, they like
Who activated KRIT?
Im on a roll like a dice game
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Steak with the shrimp and rice mane
Scrape it up, scrape it up, scrape it up, scrape
Im on a roll like a bread maker
Bake it up, bake it up, bake it up, bake
Im on a roll like them Ben Franklin's
Get to the paper, the paper, the paper

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Im on a roll like
12 for 12
Im on a roll like
12 for 12
Im on a roll like
12 for 12

[Outro]
Krizzle[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
12, 12
Ugh

[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
Lately, I been talking to my ego
That we gon' be one of the greatest to ever make it from the dirty south
It’s going down, just look alive
Fuck what they heard and who they signed you did more
For the culture than them combined it took a while to prove them wrong, 300 songs later
No debating they’ll pass the crown to ya
At the feet of a king that was chained to defeat till he rose out the creek of the sip with a chip on his shoulders
Last of a dying breed who gonna lead it
The rap shit is over
Matta fact there is no subject matter or exposure
I can feel the end getting closer
Maybe I ain't sober the drank got me dranked out
The gas mixed with hash and oil got ya tanked out
Spent so much time in the vault I was banked out
Don’t talk to me about hit song with yo stank mouth
Im being serious
Dark as night still see the vision
Country boy break the block with no collision
Old school MC with no suspension
Sometimes it was me and God and my religion
Itchin to make some scratch
And jump in the 'Lac with the twanks and the flat
The diamond in the back
Bumping UGK, my rims don’t scrape, my trunk on quake
I can't hear hate like "What you say?"
Fuck yall niggas
Im 10 toes down
And still moving
I never seen so many with rings thats still losing
Never seen so many faces
Don’t mean they boo hooing
Why you worried bout me and mine what you doing
That goal ain't fooling ain't never ever ever
I buried mine im running out of shovels
Angel wings and those that tuck their feathers
Until I'm tired of here and go to heaven!
Krizzle![Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
There I go again, there I go again trying to take it work
Everything I say, everything I say I put it on a shirt
Maaaaaaaaan
If I keep this ima get everything I want
Keep doing what I’m doing
Cuz im doing what these other niggas don’t
Ugh
Shit was crazy been crazy
I’m just trying to mix the flow with the flava
Keep it louder than cable, ugh
Whippin till Oprah my neighbor
If you ain’t scoring all the points
Or winning in the finals them labels will trade ya
If a nigga can't respect the stats and you balling out the trap them niggas is haters, ugh
Ain’t no reason just to flash tho
Wood grain on the dashboard
I been shittin’ on these non believers
Money made me an asshole
Walking round the bank asking all the bank tellers
"Why so serious?"
They only know me by my government nowadays and they way too curious
How he getting money money? ugh
He deposit like its nothing, ugh
I’m the last dragon breathing, ugh
Def Jam kept me in the dungeon, ugh
Now I’m on the dough
On the grind
Of the boy
Break it down
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who the coldest MC around?
Creeping crawling bumping sounds
Got more TV than a lounge
Bottle service white and brown
So much drank that I can drown
Stand on the back of these couches
Shout out to DJ they shout us
The love us with more than them vouchers
Its crazy the industry doubt us
So I’m picking up the pieces
President starch and the creases
Make it where they gotta see me
Pay me just to come to meetings
Ain’t nothing change, ain’t nothing changes, ain’t nothing changed at all
I’m still multi till the sun die and I’m doing this for my dawg
Krizzle

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Like that there
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
One time now
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Ugh
12 for 12
I’m 12 for 12
I’m 12 for 12
Krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Ugh
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Ugh
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Let's go[Intro:]
Hey whats the motherfuckin' deal baby?
K-R-I-T in the motherfuckin' booth
Hitlab studios, Multi Records, 3-0 B, Queen City
I'm jackin' 4 beats nigga

[Hook: Big KRIT]
The killa K gonna blow off anything you drivin'
Five in the mornin' (?) knockin'
Hey, I'm the hottest, it's my CD they coppin'
Hey, I destroy you anywhere, anybody

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Hey, you niggas talk a lot - I see it in your nature
You ain't feelin' me? Ya'll motherfuckers haters
But, I expose the fake asap, the K clap
Pull up in a Maybach and leave a hater face flat
With no remorse for him, better call his peoples
He couldn't feel it in the air, he was Beanie Seagel
I showed up breakin' bread, takin' name, and givin' orders
Yea, I'm something like Troy, universal soldier
I made it in the street but, they heard it miles away
How he known in Atlanta? He live miles away
I'm that 'sippi shawty, no more cotton pickin'
Unless you talkin' white-tees and throwbacks I'm kickin'
We pop the tags and buying bars while our bumpers drag
They gettin' mad and jockin' hard cause those niggas fag
I'm 'bout my paper, you can keep the fuckin' fame dear
I'm touchin' down, I'm about to change the game here

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Bridge: Dem Boyz B]
That boy got flow, that boy gone grind
That boy gone blow, that boy gone shine
That boy got hustle, that boy got fire
That boy done struggle, that boy gone ride

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Okay, when you see me, don't speak unless it's 'bout some cheddar
I ain't in the closet, but I got Barrettas
I know gorilla niggas, call 'em jungle fellas
They ridin' on propellers and open up like (?)
On them niggas that claim they gutter and own the spots
I'm Mr. Clean, I street sweep niggas off the block
I don't fare well with niggas talkin' down G
The K's a Buddhist in this game, I don't eat beef
I just kill bars and flood hoods with sick beats
And make niggas quit rappin' and get J-O-Bs
Because I'm hot with it and they not with it
I could sign after I die - blow and sell millions
I touch the hood with the swagger, sayin' flow's a miracle
They way I spit up on the track, some would say is spiritual
I got the Glock Four, I sell it all for profit
I got the South with me shawty, can't nobody stop it

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Bridge: Dem Boyz B][Intro:]
That Hood Fame, you heard shawty?

And we can ride a bit
Talking that butt (?) and slidin' it
Bumpin' that slow DJ Screw, O-G Ron, Chamillion too
She know I'm still the best, she like to spell my name
She heard I'm just a playa, but she still chose me man
She wanna roll with me, let me in and blow on it
Anywhere she'll go with me, wanna say yes like clover tree (?)
Hey, I'm the flyest nigga 'round, shit is going down

Put her to sleep, throw my fit on and (?) out

Say you got it, well show me

Pull up, hop out, clean
Everybody wanna be a pimp nowaday
But don’t nobody wanna break a ho
Kick a do’ when the plane don’t fly
Get your blimp nowadays
So, waddup dawg?
Ain’t nothing changed since the pimp went broke

I'm talkin' bout hay in the middle of the barn
Sippin' on all that oil, blowin' on that napalm
That fire, ho, motherfuck all my rivals
Same niggas talkin' shit 'bout me won't ride fo', but I'll slide fo'
What I believe, don't trip, let the trunk bang
I'm still a country motherfucker, shawty, I'm gettin' head while I'm grippin' grain
I spend a grip on a pinky ring, I blew a tire, threw the car away
I did it big in the club last night, but a nigga goin' hard today

What I believe, don't trip, let the trunk bang

When y'all was watching cartoons I was peeping Shafts
Acting bad, swangin' lane to lane, drippin candy paint
Ain't no ho this side of the Mississippi resist my candy thang
Fly without a plane
Debonair, throw without a care, hoes, they stop and stare
Toot it up triple boot it up, pop 'n lock it there
Drop it there, rock it there, I'm a motivator
Haters best keep walking if it ain't about paper
I'm trill, down like Four Flat
Tires on the cut-throat, SS, or a Cadillac
See they might of slither on the syrup I'be been sippin
Came out my momma's womb breathing life into this pimpin'

Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted, let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

[Verse 1]
Woke up out my dream, me and my life's supreme
Fuck you mean?
Went from rags to riches on the scene, now they call me king
Father saw my crib like, this the wildest shit he'd seen
Living proof that God got a plan if I don't intervene
Old school cleaner than a bitch put it on some heels
Round table eating with my team, let me catch the bill
Touching down
Fuck you niggas out here always hating
If I listen to your barking, I might never get this paper
Kept it playa from the rooter to the tooter to the tomb
I been on it since Ms. Rhonda went and pushed me out the womb
Hallelujah! Ain't no losing when your winning on the court
I supplied my own demand, ain't no way I come up short

[Hook]
Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted, let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

[Verse 2]
Hoped up out my whip with the candy drip
April showers when they lay me down
Underground, I won't smell the flowers
So I'm only up early morning putting plans in motion
I can't let this go to waste, nigga out here been losing focus
Chasing after hoes and acceptance from the non-believers
How the fuck you judge the South if you never ever seen it?
That's just on the real, fuck you if you think its cotton fields
Nigga we out here buyin cribs bigger than the buildings that you in
Put that on my grill, that's just how I feel
Blow a check, looking like I'm King Tut
All this gold around my neck
Lord, Hallelujah! For the shine I was given
All the hate I don't mind
I'll recline cause I'm winning

[Hook]
Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted, let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
I'm talking, like, sonic booming, like Jackson State. You know what I'm saying, like, a trunk of the old school whip. Driving by your grandmomma house trying not to wake her up, but you keep hitting donuts cause you ain't got nowhere to go kind of 808 sub booming system. The interior fucked up, but you really don't care at all. Nah, your playa-potnas wanna ride with you, but they don't give you no gas money kind of booming. I'm talking about '99. SLAB vogues, get you an adapter. You don't really want your rims to scrub and all, but that just how it be. Sub on. (echoes)[Hook]
Ay keep it movin' pimpin' I don't know you (x3)
Go on with that talkin' hard fo' I have to choke you off
Ay keep it movin' shawty I don't know you (x3)
Go on with that talkin' hard fo' I have to choke you off

[Verse 1]
Keep it movin' nigga I don't know you
Ay it's a rap shawty I'mma blow too
See me in the streets so I'm chillin' in the club
Either way I'm gettin' paid and they still showin' love
Ride through Atlanta and they know who jammin'
Young Krizzle [?] at the club what's happenin'
Cuz that's what's happenin'
And I've been buzzin'
You'se a rap as a front homie I'm still hustlin'
Folk know the K 'bout to take this game
I'm a pimp and it oozes out my veins
You can be a king long as I see millions
Homie you can stay king as long as I get millions
Cuz I'mma hit the scene and give em somethin' to feel
End a whole lot of careers when I sign my deal
In a position of power, we gettin' paper
You wanna end the K reign you better get your hate up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Chop a nigga off if he come at me sideways
'Specially if I'm in the ride sittin' sideways
Keep yo' mouth shut shawty don't show your grill
[?] talk might get ya killed
It's all brave baby in a little [?]
Niggas stop rappin' now cuz the shit I utter
They tossin' shells like they throwin' out rice
I been married to the game with a passion like Christ
Beat the mic like [?]
Gettin' money like TIP
Stay fly, igh, igh, igh, igh, igh like three 6
Hit the [?] and I spend by the grand
Ginger bread paper, get it fast as I can
Ears to the streets cuz the streets don't lie
Real recognise real and yo' credentials don't apply
Still warmin' up playa y'all ain't ready to ball
Better go talkin' hard before I have to choke you off

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Allow me introduce myself, young Krizzle in the flesh nigga
Colder than a northern blizzard, flyer than a jet nigga
Straight up out the dirty dirty where we put it down
I represent the M, [?]ville and the Jack-town
Sippin [?] shawty, rep it like it spo'd to bleed
Might as well label me, king of Mississippi
I'm on my grind daily and the hood folk raise me
See Me On Top got the internet crazy
The game ain't the same, most of these niggas dumb as label signing anything handin' out money
Boys wanna hate, but they know they can't handle us
Same ones comin' up show up like a Leprechaun

[Verse 1]
I was born on the Southside of the moon
Country boy did this big from the bottom of the map
To the top of the mountain, pimpin', I'm on the move
I'm in the groove on the late night
I make the move if the play right
You ain't seen it like I seen it
My vision nowadays 'bout as bright as the daylight
Supernova; I made a strong foundation
Outta all these boulders I carry
I ran them snakes in my yard
And you were tuckin' your tail, actin' all scary
We ain't cut from that cloth (Well)
I paid in gold what I bought (Well)
I ran circles 'round y'all
And never, ever, ever got caught (Wooh)

Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)

[Verse 2]
I was born underneath the pecan tree (Pecan tree)
With the soul of giant and the heart of a lion
But now world couldn't wait for an OG
I was creepin', crawlin', fallin' out the shack
Backwards slippin' upward through the crack
Now I creep in storage where you want to be
But barely get to see but never ever at paid for
I made more than they thought I would on my tax
I mix the candy with the grain
And the soul with the swang and the bang
And that's called bounce
We ain't cut from that cloth (Well)
I paid in gold what I bought (Well)
I ran circles 'round the non-believers
The feds, the people and never got caught (Wooh!)

Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)

Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Ain't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)

Ayy...Ayy what up folk, I'm focused man...I been doing this for a lil' while now
I had some mixtapes out, did my thang...I ain't really had the opportunity I think
To speak from my heart, man like really just express myself, so I'mma give it to em as long as I can
I ain't counting bars, so don't expect no hook...

[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
Lord I been trying all these years, and I ain't never had a thing to say
Did it by myself not a soul here to motivate me, my family was cool
But when times got hard they was like fuck this rap shit
Go get yourself a job, I thank god there were no run ins with the law
While I was riding with my folk and there was dope in the car
Momma forgive me I was in it for a minute, I was tired of 'em talking bout
My shoes and my fitted, "G-Rod" got killed and I shed a couple tears
Trying to forget that he's gone, Just remember that in here, remember that it clear
And where he at it's good, yea my nigga dead, but at least he out the hood
I'd leave if I could, that's what I plan to do, these niggas talk alot
Remind me of high school, but I thank you for your hating, appreciate the rumors
If you think that you're a winner than I'm glad to be a loser lord
No money, More problems that's just how it is, I lost another homeboy
That's just how it is, He told me Little cuz don't trip on these niggas",I said
"Fuck that, I' gonna get paper and shit on these niggas, Rip on these niggas
Don't speak when I pass you, they sold 'cuz they wanted to, we sold 'cuz we had to
Bills don't pay themselves my nigga Hell Naw!! I'm about money that's what I'm
Trying to tell ya, moms and pops I promise that I won't fail y'all, my shit jam
It's only right that I outsell y'all, I dedicate my life to this music, I dropped
Out of college 'cuz my life is this music, Next nigga out the 'Sip, really can't
Tell me shit, the beats spoke to me when the books couldn't tell me shit
I wake up like another day another headache, my purpose get's no clearer
As I'm staring in this mirror,wash my face and my ass and hit the slab hard
If I don't say shit all day, nigga I thank god, for another breath, yes for
Another step, in the right or wrong direction still it's for a progress
Moving at pace that can't be seen, scraping everything, yea my pockets is
Fat because my stature lean, I got a mean team and they will see you dearly
The only way they show respect if I make 'em feel me, I mean that sincerely
I keep more beef than chili for anxious haters waiting, plotting, prayng
Out to kill me, Why the fuck I gotta live like this momma? All the set backs
Make me feel like this momma, another southern rapper yea I bet it label
Two of my best friends Patron and Cuervo at my table we sit and talk
Millions with some hope that we can speak it to existence hah
It's certain universal laws we abide by, the dealer lives on but a child
Dies in the drive by, titans collide and blocks go to war with no earthly idea
What the fuck we fighting for, I paint pictures of this concrete jungle
Where the lions make deals with the hunters, snitch niggas kool aid heart
Pump bitch niggas, under pressure write a whole fuckin' list nigga please
I'm fighting demons like constantine, constantly trying to take what belongs
To me but I review you niggas, follow 'suit nigga, if the convo ain't
About money then I mute niggas shit, I'm focused folk, you can quote this folk
I'm about to swarm the game like locust folk, they choking folk, guess
It's hard to swallow, If I leave the 'Sip then hell yea they'll follow
I talked to the father, he tells me "Be real, nevermind what they want son
Just say what you feel", I'm knowing that the deals nowadays are some bullshit
Anything less than a mil' is some bullshit, because I know what I'm worth
Don't need a nigga to tell me..Shit! Music alone no gimmick, need a nigga to sell me
I'm here!! K.R.I.T[Hook]
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
Grew up on the country side of town

[Verse 1]
M-I crooked my nigga
Do it for the south, ya'll know
Born and raised where the rebel flag hang from the slaves
Grew up where ya'll niggas won't go
Rep that, rep that shit like I own it
I did it big for my fam and my homies
I got the biggest house on my block, foreign with the drop
For the times I was out here homeless, God flow
Time and time again I tried to tell these niggas
Yo what I say to these niggas?
Reebok, on tap dance, do whatever for a sack
Give a lap dance bitch ass nigga
Fee-fi-fo coked up
25 lighters on my dresser, ain't shit changed
Rollin' in the  ham sandwich on propellers lookin' like a strech
I'm so clean you think I might be selling cocaine
Light at the end of the tunnel
When you're flexin' it's hard to be humble
Talkin' fourth down, can't throw the ball to Def Jam
Cause they might fumble
Kick that south flow that you can't get
Try to fuck the world but my dick won't fit
My bitch like "KRIT, motherfuck they feelings
You wanna be king, gotta claim that shit"
I'm talkin' 'bout off with they heads
When you put on a mink, gotta creep down stairs
When you come from the country
Your feet on the snakes would will make clothes out of bears
I ain't playin' no games
I leave with the future, you follow these lames
I embody the South, the swing, the grain
The trunk with the bang, the gold in their mouth

[Hook]
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
Grew up on the country side of town

[Verse 2]
Ain't no love in the coliseum
This shit here been a bloodsport
Keep what you kill, fuck if they live
Cause everybody out here cutthroat
I've been quietly waitin'
Deep in my dungeon, my stomach was rumblin', my belly was achin'
Everybody wanna see a monster
Till they see the monster, the monster holla out, "What's shakin'?"
I know what you thinking, this nigga shit, must not be stankin'
He must not know better at all
Titans collide, only Zeus could survive
If not me bitch, who the fuck you gone call?
To rain from the mountain tops
Still blood stains on the leaves
I don't do it for the blog spot comment box, I do it for the OGs
And them country folk that can't talk that shit
This ain't your curb, don't walk that bitch
This ain't your porch, so keep off that shit
Go find a cliff and jump off that bitch
If you don't think that I'm king
I done proved them wrong like twice, can't stop my fight
I could murder your favorite rapper
And all I get is "No way a Mississippi nigga really that nice!"
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em
I said it six times cause it's my pleasure
Say it one more time for just for good measure, fuck em
Raised by the King that before me
Slowly crept up and still paid dues
I embody the South, the swang, the bang
The soul and the pain and the blues

[Hook]
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
Grew up on the country side of town[Intro: Big Krit and Big Sant]
History remembers kings!
God bless you all!

I don't mean to burden you. It's just, umm, I had a conversation with a wise man. He asked me a question like, "How could you be in the position to say so much, but say so little," so this is me saying a lot

[Verse 1]
I was raised from the Bible Belt, I tighten that, I'm Titan's back
Same game they claim that they killing, I'm breathing life in that
Take heed, the people you lead when you reciting that
You will die for what you believe, so where's your rifle at?
Never was entertained or influenced by all the drama
Hard to bury your partna, but harder to console her mama
That only want the best for her child
Save a place for his soul Lord, he ain't been to church in a while
Said that Jesus can't save him and ain't no church in the wild
His anger fueled his ambition, I swear he forgot how to smile
"Hustle hard, hustle hard," that's what he said
While counting up this bread that he fell for, now he dead
And they can't bring him back
They locking up my people, shawty, racks on top of racks
Public housing just too crowded God, shacks on top of shacks
Most pastors misleading people that listen
When all us black folk have is music and religion
A sense of self-respect
Lost in the need to express ourselves through money, drugs, and sex
I'm a product of the same, so I understand the texts
That says that she'll be down to fall victim to her flesh
If I'm worth it she'll undress
One night of slumber, harsh rains and violent thunders
As she leaves, "Is she clean?" Lord, I often wonder
See men turn mice for results, the clinic humbles
Plan B pill, God damn, your stomach rumbles
Laugh it off, but she'll keep it due to my numbers
So be it, I'll oversee that he runs and never fumbles
If it's a girl, I'll give her the world and sunny summers
And show her how to scrap in case her nigga jump on her
Protect them from the evils that TV often can feature
Beware of predators in this jungle, they out to eat ya
We all kings and queens, don't let no one else beseech ya
Life can throw ya some blows that leave ya swole, don’t let it beat ya
Don't let them feed you that bullshit that they fed me
Don't follow the road I took, look where it led me
I speak my mind and my heart, I bet they dread me
In a world of give me what you got, I always said free-dom
You been starving your soul so long that you should eat sum'n
You concerned with your followers, then lead them
To a well that only you and yours drink from
I build my own, fuck your playbook
Kingdom, that's how I feel, I'm strong in faith
Don't need for you to say that God ain't real
Somethings you just shouldn't play with
My soul patient cause success ain't ever save shit, face it
We all born to die, yea that's basic
But living fast and dying young ain't salvation
You keep on with that blasphemy and I'll keep on with my praying
If you think that Lambos hot in the summer, well hell's blazing
My mind frame blown cause my brother says that I'm on
He bored at the crib while I'm wishing that I was home
Said he die for the chance, and I reply to him he was wrong
Told him he could do better than me then hung up the phone
The youth, will surely go to war for what you own
To them it's more than real, but to you it's just a song
But to you it's just a song
But to us it's just a Psalm

[Outro]
I'm guilty of the same
Besides, no one person is to blame
I promise I'll change
I pray you do the same[Verse 1]
This is for them soul believers, eager to be achievers
And all those old folk on their porch that used to oversee us
It takes a village to stop the pillage of serpent seekers
Under protection from weapons I pray that God can keep us
We run away from things that used to reach us
Rather the Bible than a rifle, what can balling teach us?
Crossover, the pennies and loafers now we have to spend
Sitting on sofas, barely sober waiting on the end
Be a rapper or a Christian, KRIT
Cause in this game, there's no room for that religion shit
Acrobatic flip my temper cause I remember
It's either Heaven or Hell, and that shit simple
Fall asleep in pews the choir "Ooohs" would sooth
The battered hearts of many that life could often abuse
Who are you to mock my healing? What's a message without feeling
I don't care if you paid for mine, I'm just hoping that you listen
I might if we don't talk about your top 5
Let's just pretend all this shit ride
Turn a long road to a short drive
Overflow with ambitions, so why we wasting time?
Your inner glow ain't for dimming, I swear you're wasting shine
My time ain't for spilling, so don't be wasting mine
Don't be wasting mine
Or I can't

[Verse 2]
Like I left you at the podium
Niggas screaming out, "Family," but I ain't knowing them
Mad, cause the false love they give me, I ain't showing them
I paid my dues, no I ain't owing them
What's a rock to a mountain, so why you throwing them?
Holding a, grudge nigga
When I was on 3-hunna gave a fuck about where you was, nigga
Can't you see I'm stuck in my ways? I never budge, nigga
Where you at be content with self
Jealousy inevitably ain't good for your health
Although I feel some type of way, I hope you acquire wealth
And never know what it's like to have your own blood wish your own death
I'll forget the situation, miscommunication
Could've been solved, just as simple as a nigga waiting
As a nigga waiting
But we can't

[Verse 3]
In the same mind frame that got us here
Show your cards and you're a fraud: David Copperfield
Drop a song with no heart, that shit ain't hot for real
I told my niggas, "I might quit," they're like, "KRIT, you're not for real"
Then I repeated what I said, bur even more sincere
Face hot look where we stopped, I cannot go from here
Lord, how can I flow from here?
I dropped over 200 songs, what can I show from here?
And I'll stop with all the frustration
I respect their opinion, but I still think they're hating
Waiting on the day that K.R.I.T Wuz Here, ain't some shit I'm chasing
Downplaying my album, that shit was far from basic
Murder rappers, buried them on more than one occasion
And hold a candlelight vigil for the beats I'm making
Write about my life and what's right 'til my hands is aching
Only for a nigga to look at me like, "KRIT, who the fuck you saving?"[Intro: DJ Drama]
Let's go, K.R.I.T
See when it comes to god given talent
And whenever form is given
Most of us learn our journey at a early age
Sometimes the worlds teaching
Guides us to the highest path
Other times, the teacher negates our gifts
And blocks the shine
I'm here to tell you
When you're destined for greatness
No roadblock can stop that journey
Don't follow the leaders, be the leaders

[Verse]
I was prepared for the worst
Dug in deep, cause I emerged from the dirt
My nigga said "You ain't the only one"
But in truth, you got to be the first
Cause you can see the good and the bad
And you'll turn down the bad
That's a gift and a curse
I envy your will to be a better man
In a world where a better man don't even stand a chance on this earth
Bible talk, they told me that I can keep that
This time I'll leave the sheep where the sheep at
And I pray that when the wolves fall through
Their stomach still full, so they won't eat that
Which is mine? I really think I'm wasting time
Worried 'bout my people and all they sayin'
Fuck me cause I was too determined to ball
But if you knew that you could fly, nigga why did you fall?
I'm feeling like LeBron more than ever
They givin' nigga the praise, but I'm knowing that I'm better
So, fuck a ring if it don't make me a great
Why you doing too much? I'ma do what it takes
I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a boulder
That a giant wouldn't even bother to hold up
Like, Krizzle why you carrying this?
Cause it ain't enough soil I can bury it with
And it ain't enough weight, that's the scariest shit
That means I was built for more, trial and error
Almost burst into tears when I saw my brother's kids
Like I coulda have this, I gotta keep it together
But I've been chasing, way too much chasing
They'll never give me what I deserve, just face it
Fuck faking, fuck pretending like you know my story
Or what it's like to be mistaken as a basic
Country bumpkin, watermelon
Chicken-eatin', collard greens
Neckbone chillin' motherfucker
We’re the butt of all jokes grew up here
And we'll show you have no clue of what it's like to be southern
Knowing you a king and in spite all you dream
Had to be a nightmare for you to wake up
And those two hour meetings with the label betting money on
Another excuse that they'll scrape up
For me to do it out of pleasure, another pay cut
And they wonder why a nigga never say much
I never was the begging type
I couldn't picture this shit, I never cared for likes
I never cared for what your opinion would be
And even if I did, nigga shame on me
I live my life, a hundred fucking miles and running
Only for a nigga to sit and try to tell me something about the music
Culture, consumer, vultures
The music that I make ain't for radio, bogus
The people just wanna hit the club and have fun
And I don't make that kind of shit and that's really the culprit
Art is art no matter how you sculpt it
Mold it, grow it, only to go unnoticed
Cause nowadays we just focus on them thots
And niggas selling kool aid on a soapbox
I'm imprisoned to my mission, screaming listen
Lord I wish I could stop
I wish I could tell them 'bout the book
But they caught up in the movie, lights and the props
The pyro, and the award shows and the fancy clothes
And well-offs, extorting the have nots
Man, fuck this shit

[Skit: Big KRIT & Unknown Old Head]
Aw, shit. Look it here. Here he go. I know you gonna say something about that, 86. 86 ain’t even worth nuth–
‘Ey. 'Ey

What was it?
That’s still together
You goddamn right. Let’s go[Hook: Big K.R.I.T. & (Erykah Badu)]
I got no time to waste
I got more bills to pay
I got more mouths to feed now, now, now
I got no time to play
I got no need to stay
When ain't no money around, round, round
What's a king without a crown?
(Time's a wastin')
What's a car without some sound?
(Don't you take your time, young man)

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Never been on that silly sucka shit
Rather ride pimped out four-doors
With the wood-grain dashboard, and a rim that sits swole
And the embroidered headrest
Yeah, that be dead fresh
In your ear like headsets
Sleepy eye, forever grind, no bed rest
I can't depend on that next check 'cause it ain't bout shit
The type of broke that got me searching through my mama's couch
For some loose change, got that dollar menu
McDouble, a small fry, lemonade and sweet tea blended
Now here it is Monday, will that get me through 'til Wednesday?
It’ll kill them hunger pains even though it ain't fulfilling
I make do with what God give me, and I take it day by day
I would come by more often, but I can't stay, 'cause...

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T. & Erykah Badu]

What's a king without a crown?
(Time's a wastin')
What's a car without some sound?
(Don't you take your time, young man)

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Try not to step on my toes
Wit' your swole bankrolls you blow and throw
On stripper pole pros you barely know, make it rain
If I was paid with no knowledge or two months late on my mortgage
In the hood that ain't safe, I'd do the same thing
But wishful thinking ain't shit without genius
I can't define how I feel, that's why I'm searching for meaning
No need to pinch me in my player suite, I know when I'm dreaming
My mama tell me 'be careful,' 'cause she know when I'm scheming
Lottery winners don't run in my family
Nor do seven dots when dice starts, so ain't no sense in me gambling
We just crap out
Maybe they'll listen to me, if I pulled the strap out
Like 'give me everything, or I'mma black out', 'cause

Personally my nigga, I'm trying to do this shit for the hood, for the streets, my nigga. Ain't never gotta worry about me going commercial man, even when I do make a bumping ass track, them shawdys goona get jiggy to it in the club, I'm still gonna be on some playa ass shit, you get that my nigga? And that's real talk man, I've been representing for the 3rd coast shit since as long as I can remember my dawg. And I'm just gonna try and do it big for the hometown, for the state, and for the whole coast my nigga because we gotta stay down for each other and that's real talk. Big KRIT shawdy, get it and gone[Intro]:
Young Krizzle shorty, I'm on a whole nother' level man

And I don't know about him dog, but this my Krit
I mean this that hit
I'm a handful [?]
I can stretch green like [?]

Need a chick, fuck a chick, and I never ever call her
Never ever [?], niggas always stallin'
Find that time and courage to federal involvement
This is not a game dog, we know lanes honey
Swift with the stick bitch, I'm big for their shortcomings
Funny how these niggas always got they fuckin' hands up
Like a stand up comic that never ever stands up
Huh, thank God I'm not the joking type
Shut em' down, close em' down, I'm not the open type
Come Friday night, lights bring out the beast in me
I the beast in we, I destroy you easily

The littlest of niggas I drill you nigga
Mama crying on ice straight chill you nigga
Pale face and bomb influence straight fill you nigga
And only thing his folk could really really feel this nigga
The streets is talkin' only few can hear
And that bar worth jumping only few can clear
So I strap up my forces and I wait my chance
Now theres only so much money I can stuff in my pants
I stuffed in my mattress, stuff in my safe
Till a nigga paranoid that his life at stake
Then theres niggas comin' round like "give me some"
I unlock the strap then I give them one
Then I give them another cuz' I ain't stubborn
And life ain't forever and I want to see a hundred
Wait!
You niggas can't get what I got
I know only one count so I take a couple shots

[Hook:][Hook: Big KRIT]
4eva is a mighty long time
I do it for the South and them folks that held me down
Forever in the game, forever Multi
Forever getting mine, forever on the grind
What's a king without a crown ho?
What's a car without some sound ho?
What's a king without a crown ho?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes all I need a bass
And a little liquor to ease my mind a bit
Cause even when you polished, niggas won't let you shine for shit
That pot to piss in turned into a house on hill
I'm talkin' two stories no fabrication, that's a true story for real
And ain't no ghost writer, my flow tighter than gorilla fists
Keep it poppin' like hot grease, fried up with your catfish
Cut throat with that bucket seats, bust a quiche, I split her peach
Young Krizzle, fruit ninja, crouching tiger, hidden freak
Ho what's up, I got more to tell
Dreams is cheap I got more to sell
Crush linen, grain grippin', don't touch my buttons
I hate it when a bitch gets overzealous
So chill ho
I got a point to prove, that's the reason I rhyme fo'
Third coast, I put it down fo'

One more time for them folk that didn't know
Two more time for them folk that didn't listen
Three more time for them folk that said growth
Was impossible, for a country boy
Like they could spit, like they could flow
Shawty everybody wanna be a rapper
But everybody out can't do a show
So I'm slammin' doors and work the wheels on her
Pop my bands and pop a bill on her
Shit changed since Krit Wuz Here
I raise my glass and crack a seal on her
Cause I deserve that, got a old school
Let me swerve that, in my own lane
I make my own beats, I write my own rhymes
I grip my own grind, I grip my own grain
And that's royalty
How else I'm 'sposed to live?
I made do with what God gave, I do exactly what I feel
Yeah I play my part and I gave my heart and I represent for my crib
Just like them kings that came before me, I'mma keep it trill

Nah not yet
I'm ready to create now
Naah not yet, hold on
No, let's create now
Aight

Let's just take our time
Pretend like we started this
Pretend like we are creation
Pretend like it's all on us to be perfect
How about, let's just be perfect
And let us not pretend that we ain't made in God's images
Let's make good on these promises and be perfect
How about let's be perfect

[Verse 1]
These hands of mine can hold the weight of planets
Allow me to use the hues of lunar cools to paint a canvas
Of explosions and vibrant emotions that we know we could
Explore the outer most with no risks, even though we know we should
You are the ocean, I am a mountain
When a piece of me falls off in you there's no way of countin'
The days and times another you and me will arrive
But watch it grow to reach the sky
Emoted to be like  you and I
I hope it has your glowing eyes
The light, the dark
I won't refuse it love, instead I'll give it heart
Probably the same color as Mars
Was shining, blinding stars
To the fathers afar
Until it reaches God

[Hook]

[Break]
I know what this means
You are all my sins
On this back seat car
Do it big, do me baby
I know what this means
You wanna be a star
Won't you Shake it for me, shake it for me baby
Do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Oooh do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Baby, baby, baby

[Outro]
So what should we call it?
Cadillactica
Cadillactica?
Cadillactica[Verse]
Let me die just to see my name on the wall
Never fall, gotta make due
Yea I signed my first deal, wasn't no mill
Barely had a dollar to my name and I was broke by day two
Doing all types of songs, they were jammin, don't get me wrong
But my pops was like "J this ain't you"
Now I'm in the 'sip takin trips to B-ham
Cause eating off the food in my grandma's kitchen wouldn't do
I'm talking in the studio
All night mixing from scratch
Making beats, at the best getting less than the crack my nigga servin'
Thinking "Where did I go wrong?"
Never should have quit school
I'd probably make more money flipping burgers
Than kicking verses for niggas serving chicken for skrilla
To buy some bottles for change
But all the while I’m hurting inside, tuck in my pride
Knowing I'm ahead of the game, shit
I wrote my best songs on the grey hound of the A
Bitch I swear I ate a sandwich a day
I'm talking shit with the junkies at the race track
Peddling CD's that most niggas ain't played
Gave it for free, cause most niggas ain't paid
I gotta get heard, take a hit of that herb
I'm high as fuck, asking myself
What good is a win if I take a loss?
There's no answer
Blow the re-up on a dancer
Down to fuck with money but I'm to scared to chance her
Hit the DJ booth to get my songs spent
Talking "Just Touched Down" but my flight got cancelled
With a bottle in my hand, it's pretty much gone
Take a slow sip, tryna pretend that I'm on
With these 'sace shades, buck 50 soakin wet, with the heart of a lion but my pockets of a wretch
And that's before your favorite rapper said he was a vet
I didn't have muscle to pull
I couldn't stretch to the finish line
While you was eating breakfast it was dinner time
For a pro nigga go getter
Young nigga face but the soul of a old nigga
Grew up to be just like my pops and it shows, nigga
Rap name fixed
But then there was a whole lot of "Who the fuck is this?"
A whole lot of "KIRT's" and "Who the fuck is KRIS?"
Another acronym that don't stand for shit
And when it comes to names that's as bad as it gets
Fast forward ten years, now who don't know KRIT?
Two albums on the shelf, I beat the sophomore jinx
I lost a few friends over ends, we don't speak
I'm thinking this must be what God really want for me
Top floor reminiscing, lord I can't sleep
Like, what happens if I close my eyes and it's all a dream
And I'm backin that telly on Martin Luther King
Tryna make a difference
Caught up in my feelings, lord why they won't listen?
Riding with my partner and he riding dirty
I'm kinda scared, cause I know he ain't gonna take his charge
He ain't prepared, and he'll have to face that
And I just needed another ride to the race track
I'm so thankful that them laws never pulled us over
God took the wheel, cause neither one of us was sober
Downing bottle after bottle just to make it better
I survived the worst of it, now it's KRIT 4eva

Yeah my nigga ain't no stoppin' this shit man. It's a movement my nigga. When you see Big KRIT man say it's a movement See Me On Top volume 2 man get ya mother fuckin issue nigga

BK baby, Mississippi representer shawty
Check the vocab

[Verse 1]
Ay I'm back like I never left
On some two step shit
Make a nigga breath easy like he lost breath quick
With my flow's geometric, something like a rubik's cube
All I do is play the block it's something like a rubik's cube
I'm just a [?] fella fuckin' with some poster gyala
Somethin' on that model type Jessica Alba look alike
And I ain't gotta stunt let me get the [?]
Never leave the [?] without the [?]
I'm so space age pimp shit you know that
My career you could strap to c4 and couldn't blow that
I make a nigga up his vocab and [?] books
I just spit til the track go off who need hooks
I'm the newest of the newest yeah the flow so fluid
After this hit the street they probably chop it and screw it
Turn the block like stop signs [?] the payment
Try to avoid all convo's shut the fuck up and pay me
I'm [?] maintain my rep
When they asked who killed the track I'm the usual suspect
You nigga's is like dykes all mouth but no nuts
A pimp without fuckin' a pimp without sluts
And that's the day I'm shamed that ya CD is garbage
Should've thought about your future took ya ass to college
But lets be honest you niggas you don't compare to me
They just repeat the same shit like extra figures and Parakeets
[?] the cook book decay is your recipe
Hop the game rock the game accessorize accessories
I'm on another plane nigga you been riding [?]
Ay this is first class bitch you reside in coach
I'm the last of the first and the first to last
In this mixtape war we'll murk ya ass

Move, smooth, gotta get to it
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nah
I got a big backseat for a super freak
Tell them mothafuckas it's goin' down
Back road, a shortcut the lane
Fuck the law, they can't stop the bang
Cut the double cup of purple rain
Tell them fuck critics I'll never change
Young K.R., I.T. my niggas say
Gotta keep a dash closed with the .44
Cause them jackas rob 'round here every day
So I chill, for the bills, diamonds against the wheel
Pressin' the buttons while clucky bust-its peep how I live
Goin' in for the kill
Champagne poppin' daily
No petty numbers, shipes
Fuck 'em, just tell 'em "pay me" fosho
Hoes love it, niggas know it, 'bout time
Ride clean, like a billion suns, they can't stop my shine
Tell 'em one more 'gain for that 2000 beyond
That king shit, I be on, tell a bitch nigga to be gone
Cause my

Pull up with hoes in the
Diamond in the back, they chosen, uh, posted up
Pourin' up
Be it the sticky icky got you rollin' up
Hold it up, be a soldier don't be closin' up
Open your mind, (open your mind, open your, open your mind)
Open your mind, (open your mind, open your, open your mind)

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I'm walkin' up into the party, and feelin' and killin' the party
A couple of women are chillin' and sippin' Bacardi
She walk me up into the hallway, I started on kissin' the shawty
And feelin' so good, thug bitch from the hood, but really though
Might get some ass tonight, hit it like a real man should, I'ma kill it though
Make a right, open that 'frigerator, crack that 40 ounce
Head into your momma room so I can hear that naughty sound, don't play around
Your parents ain't around, and plus your room is packed
I'ma hit it from the front, I'ma hit it from the back, bust it like a gat, pat pat
Kissin' party with a couple bad bitches, gettin' dirty with all of my niggas
Feelin' woozy but I'm pourin' more liquor
But the cutie booty couldn't be bigger
I'm celebratin' cause we shouldn't be here
Hella faded cause the Hennessy near
Dedicated to all of my peers, A$AP, the vision so clear
I can see you haters from here, I can spot you out of my chair
My throne, you won't come near, the microphone is on fire
The booth is Roman, I'm sire, I'm king of this shit, I'm no liar
I'm droppin' careys, Mariah, got the grip on the game like I'm pliers

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Niggas talk that big shit nowadays
But they muscles ain't strong enough
Niggas claim they change the game
Catalogs ain't long enough
Slow motion, I'm still posted
In the cut, been waitin' my turn
Fell off cause you wasn't yourself
Oh well, nigga live and you learn
Money don't concern me, I was too determined
Fuck what you heard, I feed my fam
I put on for mine, I let my brother shine
And I be comin' down like goddamn
We made it, that check on me, my nigga
For what it's worth, I don't go to work
So this verse ain't free, my nigga
This work ain't free, my nigga
Yeah it's above average cause they're raisin' taxes
Dropped twelve albums, that's a grand apiece
And plus I made the beats, you do the mathematics
No watches, no dope money, I'm just Southern
One of the coldest niggas that's in the game
And I've only been on one major cover, like damn
Either they don't know, they don't show
Or they don't care what happens in the South
Or either I'm too smart, or they too dumb
To know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout when I say

They wanna be down with the (last) King, (two!)

[Verse 1:]
I ain't for sure, give me strength just to change what I can’t
And understand the difference between a nigga and the King that I am
Didn't write it but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant but my bloodline is of kings
Scrappin' from the game I'll be King just you watch
See KRIT ain't just a name it's an acronym
King Remembered in Time but none come after him

[Outro:]
And now for our feature presentation[Chorus]
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup

[Verse 1]
I come from the bottom, name of the cotton
Do whatever just to profit
Who is that knockin' off in the projects
'Fridgerator, empty pockets
Just a dream of makin' dollars
Fly my mama to the tropics
When you barely used to make it by
You were do or die now we got it
Look at how we livin' now
Skyscraper tall, built from the ground
Tired of seein' my pops go to work
Can't wait 'til the day he can lounge
Promise that I do it big
For my family and my friends
Took some losses just to win
Put Multi till the end

[Chorus]
Lookin' like a layup, layup, layup (that's a layup, that's a layup)
Layup, layup (that's a layup, that's a layup)

I remember talkin' 'bout how we gon' make it out the hood, man
And no matter who blow up first, we'll rep that, understood, man
Gotta represent, I do it for my hometown
M-I-Crooked, we done took it worldwide, worldwide, we on now

Nowadays we drive slow, scorin' with my eyes closed

I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like U-like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless

[Verse 1]
I just wanna come down one day, 'round one day
Candy painted with surround one day
Clown one day, show the grill, show the grill
I just wanna bend the corner late night to the early morning
Got an old school with some new components
Back then, they didn't want me
Now that I'm swangin', they all on me
Now that I'm pullin' up clean, I doubled the figure like double the cup of the lean
Glasshouse with the gleam, screams like puppets on strings
Yadadamean
4 pm at the Kappa on swangers and adapters watchin' me ball, yeah
Salamander on the slab, two miles per hour, they watchin' me crawl, yeah

[Chorus]
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like U-like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas (Chop suey), swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless

[Verse 2]
Poppin' up twice, trunk shakin' like a fist full of dice
Wrist game like a cooler of ice
Chandelier-like, who need some light?
UFOs like, who need a ride?
Don 'Ke keep the South on the side (Southside)
Southside while I'm tippin' on fo's
Suplex when I'm slammin' them doors
Top drop, keep my halo exposed (Look at that)
Swang down, sweet chariot stop
Ron C might go off with a chop
Beltway all the way to the top
Jammin' Screw on a tape 'til it pop (Screwed up)
Texas gave me a lot, feel like it's home
From M-I, crooked with love
Forever it's diamonds and wood in the chrome, mane!

[Chorus]
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas, swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless
I-I just wanna pull up (Pull up, pull up)
Like U-like UGK used to double cup the fluid (Po' it up)
DJ Screw, chop suey
Learnin' shit from Texas (Chop Suey), swangin' that bubble eyed Lexus
Neon every exit, poppin' that trunk so reckless

Learnin' shit from Texas
Learnin' shit from Texas[Intro]
Yeah man
Motherfuckers tell me
I cuss too much in my motherfuckin' lyrics
A'ight fuck them pussy ass motherfuckers man
That's how I feel
I let it show, shit
I let it show, yeah
I let it show
I'm outchea all night

[Verse 1]
You think you are ballin' but you ain't even hit the court
I throw money at bitches like you would think it's a sport
We pop bottles and be out like like we just wanna rain
Big [?] or models, they twerk that pussy all the same
I got two gold chains, and two bad bitches
All these bands in my pockets, it's hard to pull up my britches
I put the "K" in Kountry
I put the "P" in pimpin'
I give a fuck what you think, shorty
And fuck how you're feelin'

[Hook]
I let it show (yeah-h-h) (x3)
I'm outchea all night
With the highs and lows

[Verse 2]
You don't pay my bills, you don't write these songs
You don't know my life, naw bitch I'm grown
You can hold them rocks
You can throw that salt
If the ho chose me, pimpin', it ain't my fault
I got two old schools, one for the boppers
And one with the engine that get away from them coppers
I put the "B" in bumpin'
I put the dub in whippin'
I give a fuck what you think, shorty
And fuck how you're feelin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Tell Def Jam run that bread, I don't give a fuck
Drop top, goods, bitch I gave my whip a tummy-tuck, uhh
I beat that pussy like it ain't the same, shorty
Shit, you might just put my name on it
Roll around town like I own the whole city
Fuck the hotel, brung the whole club with
Lame motherfuckers, gotta get 'em out my way
I got a new bad bitch like I get married everyday
I ain’t no trapper, I ain’t no rapper so don’t push me to no killer
This money is a jungle, I'm a silverback gorilla
The house sit on some pillars
Dolamite my kin
I'm knockin' doors down like my trunk Pacific rim

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm outchea all night, with the highs and lows
I'm outchea all night, with the wives and [?]
I'm outchea all night night, with the neon glows
I'm outchea all night, with your wife and your ho[Intro: Va$htie]

Back one more ‘gain for all them players
Natural women and mindframe elevators
Ten toes down with this experimental south sound
Dope up the lines enough to go around and around and around this world thrice over
Ain’t nothing new under the sun back in ’05, I tried to told ya
We here 4Eva in a day, can’t go back with this one way
Take you to where the grass is much greener
Putting in work for my redeemer
Yea that’s the most high
I ain’t talking ‘bout blunts rolled
But like saved souls and warm welcomes at front doors
Don’t let your problems weigh you down
Don’t let them burdens slow yo pace
The quickest way from A to Z is straight
On that narrow path, a road less traveled
So free yo mind and be one with time ‘cause that’s all that matters
Not all that riff raff or random chit chatter
Haters scatters like jacks do
Don’t drop the ball unless you can pick up all the weight that a winner has to
Don’t let the struggle outlast you
Even if society outcasts you
Stand strong in your belief
The mountain top ain’t hard to see
When you let God and let be

Transmission I miss my mark day one
I was so close to the sun, I burnt the top off my roof
I travelled a million miles to uncover what most would doubt
Although I believe in God, I need proof
I'm itching for conversation, answer if you can hear
Where you lost amongst shining stars?
Life can seem oh so clear, death can seem oh so near
Dodging these comets, I promise my baby I be back if I lose cons-(cuts off)
Tell her I love her, I miss her
I keep her picture upon my dash
And I wish her the best of luck, that's if I crash
I saw a flash just the other day while I was making haste
Could be reaching, but I found a beacon attention base
I get paranoid swerving around these asteroids
Lord forbid I have to abort my mission
But it gets hard when you searching in the dark
For that one and only spark
I think I see what's missing

[Hook]
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life

[Verse 2]
I found life, in the darkest of times
How can I describe what's God's design
With these faulty eyes that often lie
Stars shine bright but they often die
I'm asking for permission to perceive
I'm closer than I've ever been
I probably shouldn't leave
I probably should record some of the things that I perceive
To be more sublime and divine than you and me

[Hook]
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life

I found life upon this planet

The planet Cadillactica was created within the history of the big bang,  or what we like to call the 808. Now we are privileged to experience something sonically never heard before. Wait wait, it's starting[Intro]
Life is a gamble, oh baby
Where you win or lose
Life is a gamble

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I roll the dice one time for my folks that died off
Rep the side they believe in but they side lost
Let me toss a seven for the ones won't see tomorrow
Cash those chips in for some time we don't need to ball
Gunshots ran out, everybody hang out
Yellow tape party, all over we sang out
I don't like this feeling, ain't nothing that appealing
Bout reminiscing, over you, my God
I couldn't cry cause your mama couldn't stop crying
And that's hard, lord I wish my folks would stop dying
But who am I to say it wasn't your time to black out?
You betted all on a spot, I guess you crapped out
For the finer things, indeed we chase
We told you pace yourself
It's funny, how the things we love, can make us hate ourselves
Russian roulette table, I gotta bet safer
You gotta know when to fold your cards
When you ain't able to reach into that dash when that
Jackal up and flashed that, brass like
Give me all you got or that's your ass
That's all that it would took, the house got me shook
Cause ain't no point spread, but god doing books

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Life is a gamble feel like I'm rambling sometimes
Like what the fuck I'm sposed to say in this rhyme
I shed tears and they won't come back
I said the word and they won't run back
My slot machine was broken this time
Ain't no tokens, I can't redeem to preserve the focus of mine
So many died and I'm scared it's just a matter of time
For I'm lifted myself, six people I know
Ain't been in church in a while, I heard I reap what I sow
Casket close, Caddy doors, can't commemorate
This tracks my gurney, my verse can be the ventilator
So I breathe, cause Loathing in Las Vegas wasn't meant for me
Too scared I'll stay too long and forget where I'm really meant to be
Heaven maybe, heaven lately, but all these lights are captivating
I had to play it, for the sake of me and mine
Lord, I pray I hit it big this time

[Hook][Verse 1]
Fresh to death yes I be
Yeah God broke the mold when he designed me
I'm so forward with the flow you gotta rewind me
The lames don't work for you shawty come try me
I'm in the hood with the good that's where you find me
Ya'll artists can't write hits shit come sign me
Can't deny me I'm Jordan in his prime
I'm the type of rapper that drops all the time
Swag is vicious wordplay stupid
Take shots at your heart nigga but I ain't Cupid
No love here this my year
And I just that I'd make that clear

[Hook]
Turn the lights out
You don't really wanna throw them things that I didn't get to find on your brain
Turn the lights out
You might wanna cuff your dame she think of me beam you out the frame
Turn the lights out
The wrist go hard the chain so large I glow in the dark don't believe me
Turn the lights out
I'm the main attraction after me
Turn the lights out
The waitin' on the kid they wanna see me
Turn the lights out

[Verse 2]
The second time around the second time I clown on em
I'm talking 1980's I'm getting down on em
Turn the lights off I still shine I'm star bright
So far the kid balls star light
Hustle, pimpin' you know what I'm a bizzout
Niggas let their mouth dig hoes they can't get izzout
All this while to get in [?]
Masterpieces I've painted they trynna ruin my image
Shawty like to call me Picasso
Sistine Chapel you do it with the afro
I'm so Van Gogh think of me as art
I look like money in the dark

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This time the last time I promise the haters
If I end your career I'm just doing you a favor
I'm saving your paper watch your album drop
Got a million dollar budget and his album flopped
Ringtones mean a million bucks
Yeah their singles be hard but their albums suck
Yeah the label eat good but the artist fucked
Just tell you what I seen that ain't happen to us
No, there's a difference between rappers and artists
Hoes and pimps, shooters and targets
I rip regardless our time is now
But I'mma get money I'm gonna go hard until God
Turn the lights out

[Hook][Hook:]
If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
I'm talkin' everything baby, the money, the crib, the clothes, (?) she said
If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
Just keep it real with a player, we make it, we rich, I'm talkin' just like (?) out that bitch

[Verse 1:]
Well if you willin' to go, I can take you wherever
They know I throw off the chain, like Tamme, who do it better?
On the grind for this cheddar, if you ride for a nigga
If I bust out the roof, well won't you drive for a nigga?
Live fly with a nigga? Takin' trips overseas
Break trick for his money and take that shit back to me
Pull a caper for nothin', if I needed your hustle
I can get it whenever, on the run from we fuckin'
I knew you when you was younger, now you grown and you ready
Showed you how to peep game, and now you get to the (?)
Independent and steady, rockin' diamonds and pearls
Yea, you know you my girl, I told you I want the world
You said

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I know you ready for war, never trip on a ho
If they get outta line, you beat that ass to the floor
Don't be seein' them haters, just keep countin' this paper
Cook a meal for a playa, yea, you know how to cater
Get your hands, your nails done, your outfit fit tight
Them heels you love to rock make that ass sit so right
You know what a nigga like, freaky and classy
Tooted up and booted up, I love that you're nasty
I love that you're flashy and down for the cause
Never tell by any means if we breakin' the law
Never question my motives, I just want you to shine
I just want you beside me when we out on the grind
She Said

[Hook:][Hook]
Time never waits for no man
Peep the slow hand
Lions is all, we rarely know lambs
Get money, split it up with my brohams
When you go outside don’t let the door slam
Don’t let the door slam x3
When you go outside
(repeat)

[Verse 1]
Gracious lord I say a prayer for all of mine
Searching for a fixin in these broken times
I let my anger feed my hunger pain
Plotting With my brother from another mother about running things
Another round table mission
Cause rap ain't paying off and ain’t no food in the kitchen
So I am gonna get these p's with the elle with the smell that make the smokers go crazy Can you feel me like braille
Politikn bout a move or two
So we can put on for the city like they used to do
And all them hoes that didn’t call me boo
Or break their backs when they see that boy im cruising through
Cause they respect it when your clockin major figures
Throwing turkeys with the stuffin off of 18 wheelers
Watchin' for the laws with the judges on call
Shuck and jivin to get by with this pistol in my drawers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now who is that peeking in my window
Music on crescendo
Vibin' to the sounds of the endo
Playin' king kong no nintendo
I can't trust a soul niggas givin up their kin folk
Grandmammas mamma and baby mothers
Grandfathers fathers and baby brothers
Get scared find themselves undercover
You knew the consequences of pushing them junkies hubbas
I tell the story how it be
Don’t bring no dirt in mine
Don’t speak on what you see
Always call before you come
You get jammed you don’t know me
Leave that wire at the door
Wash your hands before you eat
Don’t play the game if it ain’t keeps
Be ready for the finals
Better practice what you preach
You ain't the stand up type then find a seat
Your blood is thicker than water but both them things leak

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Them tattletales tell the tales of cars and clothes
Of playa that pose for cameras and shine for hoes
Gleam and glow under strobes of lights in the club
Where drinks is thirty and shots is dubs
And people give kisses and hugs to niggas with plugs
Minus the sink, not talkin bout tubs
Talking about bass, you thinking bout sub
Marine maybe
They other holes in your boat
The people that tell be people you know
The people that hurt be people you owe
Time, now daddy ain't around to hold them down now
For the benz with drawers and rims
Instead of breaking even with odds and ends
You doing 5 to 10 on the late night
For swimming in pools with great whites
They smell that dirty money
No last train to London, or Paris
Life is more then carats and fur coats
On the low that tick tock is worth more

[Hook][Hook]
Pushin' rhymes underground like moonshine
With jump like juke joints
Ridin' like old 'lacs
Down like 4 flats
Shine like gold grills
Curls and chrome rims
Bitch you know what it is
I'm Live from the underground, underground
Live from the underground, underground
Underground, underground
Live from the underground railroad

[Verse 1]
My papa told me get paper, motherfuck a hater
Them J's look clean son but elevate to gators
I took that shit to heart plus I dug it like a crater
I'm givin' out game player are there any takers
While you was quarter sackin' I was quarterbackin
Callin' plays everyday, level All-Madden
Hi five, cloud nine, private jet lackin'
Treat the seal like a vinyl record, gotta keep it crackin'
Shall I pour up, blow some smoke up, get my spit on
Grab a paper, sit on a track and get my shit on
Ice cold water with the flow minus the lemon
I'm Cinematic Multi, what label you been on
Old school ridin' flickin' ashes in the tray
Smokin' up the booth blowin' static in they face
C.R.E.A.M., cash rules everything around me
King, checker board nigga go and crown me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Keep it rolled, I'm supposed to lose control
Oh no, pop the trunk, burn a skunk and slam a do', do'
Window crack on the ave, marinate the scene
When I lean and crawl couldn't see me with your high beams
Play my part, I got heart, I'm tailor gator sharp
Plus we sit taller than Monster trucks in them trailer park
My candy coated it cost a grip but I had to blow it
Your sides was dusty, my seats is bucket but you'll never know it
Forever tinted so you can't peep while your bitch up in it
You call her phone she give you tone like "Why you trippin'"
Cold blooded ain't it but that's how it be when they want that cash
When you ain't around anybody can be in that ass
Heard that from 8-Ball homeboy girlfriend
If she a bopper then she probably ain't your girl then
You claim you pimpin' don't be trickin' wear a curl then
And find some paint to put some swirls in

Call my name
Free your chains
Call my name

[Bridge]
I got to get a move on

[Verse 3]
They say the train still coming, it won't be long
Only the good Lord knows my wrongs
Trouble is the damn devil won't leave me alone
No time to waste, I gotta pay my dues
Lord, my problems seem to come in twos
All these miles I walk, they can't fill my shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at the time it took just to get to the top
Look at the run I had just to get to the spot
Look at the form I had just to hit me a shot
Look at the grind I had just to get me a lot
Look what I got

Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got
Look what I got
Look what I got, look what I got

[Verse 1]
Look at the time I spent tryna whip up the foreign
Check on the stats, boy I'm scorin'
Swappin' these hoes out
Hit with no doubt but the pussy was borin'
Back to the slab
Wrist was hurtin', countin' too much money that I barely could dab
Chemist in the lab, stirrin' the glass
Fuck the Uber app, I call her a cab
Yellow the swag
All the wins I got, I throw in the bag
Dig a hole, buried deep in the ground
Water it once in a while, watch it grow into cash
All you got is L's off in your stash
Picture perfect with it, watch for the flag
Gettin' to the money, marathon running
High hurdle jumping, hundred yard dash

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at the time it took just to get to the top (Tick tick tock)
Look at the run I had just to get to the spot (Hustle hustle hustle)
Look at the form I had just to hit me a shot (Swish swish swish)
Look at the grind I had just to get me a lot
Look what I got

Look what I got (Whoa)
Look what I got, look what I got (Whoa, whoa)
Look what I got (Whoa)

Look what I got, look what I got

[Verse 2]
Look at the time it took just to get to the top
Hire out the condo and buy off the lot
Fuck off in Vegas, catch me at the table, like, "Who want a knot?"
Stiff arm the haters, Heisman the pose
Signal my nigga like I need a block
Touchdown, plenty time on the clock
Field goal ho, extra point for the top, good
Flood the diamonds in the wood, hood
Like the shooting guard for Cavs, splash
Early Tuesday morning, niggas still yawning, only time I deal with trash
Bag, only emoji worth textin'
Fuck the smiley face, missin'
One hundred, strong-arm
Checkmate, multi flex-flexin'

[Chorus: Big KRIT]
Came back like the Mack, Caddy cut dime in the back
Eight track slap off the rack, I have to relapse
Po' of the fo' out the tap, break a pro back 'til it snap
She lives in my lap, eager to give up her snatch
Still on the prowl for my match
The milk and the honey, it's all about the love of the money
Space age pimp was adept, that's after the fact
Land and I make contact, destroy if they give their bomb back
Prepare for combat, peace and love still beyond that
Share the win with my comrades, that's actual fact
Odd, but they actually lack at the peak of impact
Where the soul and mind is attached
Stars will align on the map, my plan of attack
For the lost generation

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
This ain't meant to be preached on
This here meant to be teached on
I know that you ain't got much time
I promise this rhyme won't take long
You need it in your life like you need a better job
Like you need another hobby
Instead of waiting in the lobby, with the soft and the hard
Until the police holla copy, freeze
I know how it get when you ain't got shit to flush
And them balloons you bought getting bust
'Cause everybody want mo' than what they really say so
You don't know who to trust
On the outside looking in of the Beamer, Bentley, Benz
Dreaming about the backseat
But you don't know what the driver had to do just to pass by you
That's if you ask me
So, shawty, don't do the dash on 'em
I hope you never crash on 'em
What good is flashin' or livin' the fastest
If you in a casket? I couldn't imagine
My mama hanging over me crying
'Cause my soul is too young to let go of me
I'm saying what I gotta
Cause the club songs ain't saving my partner

[Chorus: Big KRIT]
Came back like the Mack, Caddy cut dime in the back
Eight track slap off the rack, I have to relapse
Po' of the fo' out the tap, break a pro back 'til it snap

Still on the prowl for my match
The milk and the honey, it's all about the love of the money

You can find me jumping off the porch generation

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
For that, KRIT, let's kill these niggas
You got skills to help build these killers (Killers)
Take the murder rate even higher (Higher)
And take a nigga bitch in the process
Turn the whole thing into a contest
My nigga fuck this mic
We should be fucking with MIC
Military industrial complex
And we can get rich, nigga, fuck showing love
They ain't listening to us
They ain't playing this bitch in the club
So let's get paid, turn these motherfuckers into slaves
School is for lames, man, these niggas join gangs
Fuck Martin Luther King, nigga, fuck change
Fuck peace, I want a chain
With Jesus on the end of that bitch like blam!
Fuck peace, I want a plane
Fill that bitch with cocaine
And make these bitches move their booties
And help these niggas make their movies
Talk these niggas into their graves
And talk these hoes out their Coogies

You abandon me
Love don't live here anymore

[Hook]
Ay you abandon me
Love don't live here no more
I'm a P.I.M.P
Who you think you fucking with?
It's the K.R.I.T baby

[Verse 1]
Was a fine dime now turned that ho
Never would a let you in I should open that door
Say she like it real fast but she ride it real slow
For a couple of them dollars she get some head on the low
Met a broad I used to talk to back in the day
When it just was J.Scott now she call me BK
Tryna get up in my grill cause I got little change
Know I'm known around here so she want some street fame
I ain't living in the past plus I never turn back
Only thing a ho can do for me in give up them stacks
When that greyhound come shawty jump on that track
Get a nigga for his dough make him pay for that cat
Nothing free up in this game so you gotta make do
If I'm out here on the grind then you gotta be too
If you can't get down shawty I suggest you hit the door
You've abandoned me before love don't live here no more baby

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Things independent women making that cash
Don't be asking me for dough you best get up off your ass
Show some ? to get you paid, let me know if you for real
If you see em doing good better get up in his grill
Here's the deal miss thang, all the dough go to myself
Cop that gator hat and shoes, you gonna get that matching belt
If you play your cards right, we can visit from the hood
Say your feelin' down and out? Well I'm doing pretty good
I don't think you understand, ain't no hope for a shawty
I just wanna get paid bring the dough to me shawty
If your man want you back, better go to him shawty
Even if you say you've change, still a ho to me shawty
Mind frame ain't been the same, ain't can nothing change that
You a stupid ass trick ay why the hell you came back?
You can't get down shawty I suggest you hit the door
You abandon me before, love don't live here no more baby

[Hook x2][Hook:] x2
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people  say I changed
But if you thinking that you never knew me from the gate man

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Ay but fuck it then
Cause I rather ride Bubble Benz and push a bucket break, scrubbing paint
Bubbling up again, on my hood
Gotta get it while the gettin good
A chemist with the pimpin mix the leather with the cherry wood
If you could you should
Slam doors on hoes
I 5th wheel my trunk while white-wallin my vogues
I tight walk on these foes just to flex
Ain't no sense in stepping out if I can't never look my best
Damn, don’t stress my bankroll
Just know I keep my bank swoll
Ain’t no place I can’t go, never trick on no stank ho
It was like that back when I was in my mama’s stomach
A player slid up out the womb and hit the ground running
Never stumbling always gunning like a popped Glock
Keep a hater boxed out
So I could rebound and ball for the top spot
All the same I’m a staple in the game
Ain't never been no lame
That’s why I find it strange when I

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Big Sant]
Who the fuck are you
Texting me at 1:46 in the evening
Meant the morning, after midnight
While I’m yawning, you were sleeping
4 door Chevy roll I’m out'chea creeping
Slamming doors in
Heavy things but I want some more
With playa pose, Roll up on hoes
That say they knew me from high-school
Maybe community college, claim they wanna do some thangs
But I can do without it
My mama name "Such and such" and we go back like baby powder
Baby I doubt it, it’s hard to swallow
You wanna lay up, I want a dollar
For the machine, I’m kinda thirsty
A little parched, she wanna ride, no you cannot
She say I’m mean I say just the hoes
And dumb niggas, kinda like you
Them B's and doe's
Reject request on Facebook
Daily duckin lames
All you know is my patna; 'em then my name
Plus you heard that I

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
You probably see me in the street but nigga you dont know me
Big Sant bitch, motherfucking OG
From the Sip get a grip, wanna visit take a trip
Ain’t a nigga dead or alive that can say that I done flipped
Im from the land of the cheese, home of the slave
Don’t confuse me with no lame
Cause that’s what just I ain’t
Alumni forever put that on the nigga next to me
Started out writing rhymes ended up writing a legacy

[Verse 4: Big KRIT]
They hollerin there he go again
What's his name, where his folk?
Call him Kurt, call him KRIT?
Fuck that nigga I ain’t sure
He got beats, heard him flow
Like a couple years ago
He alright, kinda tight
Shawty like him on the low
There he go, too much soul
I wouldn’t buy it out the store
Plus I saw him in the club
One who hollered at my ho
Just because he got some dough
From a deal he think he ill
I bet thats how that motherfucka feel
And on the real I think he changed[Verse 1]
(Fuck em) These hoes come and go, shorty (But I don't love em)
Yeah, all I ever had was God (And a pistol)
My grandma ain't around the home (I could swear I miss her)
The world at my front door (Is how it feels)
I'm havin' nightmares of dyin' (I swear it's real)
I'm scarred from a life of horror (When will I heal?)
I drink a bottle everyday (That's how I deal)
It's a blessing I saw twenty four (Ain't that the truth)
The police never give a pass (They run and shoot)
They killin' all my lil niggas (Pray for the youth)
I'm thinkin' bout retaliation (Pray for me too)

[Hook]
I'm livin' on the edge, watchin' for a sign
But tomorrow never comes, I'm runnin' out of time
Lookin' in the mirror, waitin' for a change
Tired of the pain, wonderin' will it rain?
I'm a man on fire, I'm a man on fire
I'm a man on fire, I'm a man on fire

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being broke (But how can I do better?)
Yeah, my partner haulin' gold (And never, ever let up)
Push the pedal to the metal (Tryin' not to crash)
The law's right behind me (Tell 'em kiss my ass!)
Burdens on my shoulders (Gotta pay the bills)
Roaches in my kitchen (Eyes full of tears)
Get it while it's good (Get it how you live)
Yeah, I lost a couple friends (But that's just how it is)
Never trust a soul (Cuz everybody's sellin')
Never speak your business (Cuz everybody's tellin')
Be careful when you shine (Cuz most niggas jealous)
It's death before dishonor (Now my foes under pressure)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Lil haters in the world (The price of bein' famous)
I'm tryin' to get to heaven (And kick it with the angels)
Been puttin' in the work (Dyin' to do some dirt)
God knows my heart (Cuz I ain't in the church)
Cuz everyday a struggle (The others live in storm)
What happened to the world? (2000 and beyond)
Your baby's havin' babies (Niggas dyin' to kill)
Yeah, I'm afraid to die (But I ain't happy here)

[Hook](spaced out over you...
I I spaced out over you, spaced out over you)
(Mary Jane)

Chorus
She got me so high
I'm feeling like a blimp
I first fell in love
When her lips touched my lips
Mary Jane you got me
(Spaced out over you)
And when I'm not with you
(I don't know what to do) x2

Verse 1

Any day any time we can ball out
And you around whenever my niggas crawl out
We take you ‘cross state, on top secret missions
Hey i can set you out, I know that she ain’t trippin
I start the mornin’ wit ya
I end the day wit ya
Fuck what them haters say
I’ll prolly never quit ya
Although them fellas hit ya
I know you diggin’ me
Cuz when we all alone
You only into me
And all my fantasies, you help me see them clearly
And i can't concentrate shawty when yee ain’t nowhere near me
They say you’re healthy for me
You got a thousand names
But in them years that i’ve come to know ya, you’re Mary Jane
You put me on a level, I’m talking high as high
I been to ten and eleven, i say fuck cloud nine
I never met your brothers, reggie and bobby brown
Heard they can’t stand me so they can't come on this side of town

(Chorus)

Verse 2

No matter where I go I know that I could find you
And when I’m on my grind I’m knowin that you grind too
Hey I’m a little selfish, I hate to pass you round
And when I pick you up I find it hard to put you down
I keep ya tucked away, for all them rainy days
Hey girl I dig your aura, it’s like a purple haze
You got me (spaced out), and that’ll never change
Your body light as air, I watch ya float away
Most of my friends come around cuz they wanna taste ya
I don’t know why, but some suit n ties love to hate ya
But I just love to drape ya, into the finest dutchies
And when I’m fallin down, you like a playa crutches
And when I first saw ya, I knew you was a dime
Who would’ve known ?on average? that you would be all mine
I’m just a lucky nigga, i’m really glad I found ya
It’s safe to say that I don’t know what I would do without ya

(Chorus)

Miss Mary Jane
Ay, what you know about her? (3x)
What you talking bout?
Miss Mary Jane

I bet I know about her (3x)

Who you talking bout?
Miss Mary Jane

Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Verse 1]
I remember way back in the day
All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes
Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake
From the sub, work the juice, bitch I want the bass
Can't be turning on a dime 'cause the rims scrape
Kill switches for them jackers outchea tryna take
That's my prized possession, in recession kept me straight
Clear my mind then recline on the runway, from Monday to Sunday
Just me and my old school

[Chorus]
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing changed, still the same country bumpkin
M-I crooked Super Southern don't be trippin' on my rims
I'd rather sit higher than bald eagles on shoulders of giant people
If I'm gon' ride, hell, I don't know about them
Popping my collar, rocking gators, fuck some Prada
Be a scholar of this pimpin' to the very, very end
Forever official like words out the scripture
Off the Richter, saw my future through my rear-view lens
Just me and my old school

[Chorus]
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Bridge]
See it ain't just a car
It ain't just a whip
It's a time machine
It's a spaceship
It's precious
You gotta take your time, you can't be
Rubbing on them curbs and hitting them potholes
You gotta ride clean and ride slow
Me and my old school

[Chorus]
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I remember way back in the day
All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes
Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake
From the sub, work the juice, bitch I want the bass
Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape
Kill switches for them jackers outchea tryna take
That's my prized possession in recession kept me straight
Clear my mind then recline on the runway, from Monday to Sunday
Just me and my old school

[Verse 2: LiL KeKe]
I got the old school right on these toes and slamming doors
Talking wood grain, mink on the floors and riding vogues
Chopping low, tip by slow, that’s how it go
Still a Texas boy sitting on foes and wrecking hoes
The seats so sandy fine, all cash
Fresh candy homie, branded wine - hold it down
H-town known to flip - feeling hood, looking good
With them boys out to sip, just let it dip
Convertible, the burgundy red get’s peeled off
I’m on glass when I’m showing my ass for dirty south
Don key still OG - just like the smoke fool
Riding 3 deep, me and KRIT - plus the old school

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
I used to roll in my old school, listenin’ to slow grooves
Head leaning back, had me feeling like a mac
7 mills dark black, I used to think I was goldie
"I see you shining Boss Hogg", that’s what my OG’s told me
And my old school so cool, roll like a new school
Escalade motor got it riding like a soldier
Late nights blowing dojer, reminiscing bout the past
And how now I got everything I wish I used to could have
I'm finally clean in my old school

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Outro]
See it ain't just a car, it ain't just a whip
It's a time machine, it's a spaceship, it's precious
You gotta take your time, you can't be rubbing on them curbs
And hitting them potholes
You gotta ride clean and ride slow
Me and my old school

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors[Intro]
It's now my privilege to introduce your main speaker... [clapping]
Hey, I'm Big K.R.I.T. and I'm a meditator [Hey!]
It wasn't easy to come in today, but I'm here
I just wanna meditate

[Hook]
I don't wanna hear what I've done wrong
I'll deal with my problems when I get home
I'm better off when I'm all alone
I know I said I'd stop but I'm not that strong
I just wanna meditate

[Verse One]
Said it with this glass of liquor pouring out my spiritual guidelight
Take me to the other side
Who ever said escaping your problems with empty bottles
Would only delay them til tomorrow? Yes was surely right
When the world said fuck ya, how would you reply?
No need to whisper how you feel, this is you and I
I paint pictures of hieroglyphics compared to most rap niggas
But I be over looked, so I just let it slide, let it die, how can I
Be so stupid to tell you this wasn't real
Be so eager to tell ya just how I feel
But lets be honest, the real reason I'm here
To be clear I was never the man of steel
I fell victim too many times to count
Too many times I've died, too many things I doubt
Not enough love in my house, my house is not enough
It's filled with pointless things and those things keep piling up
Those things'll leave you crushed if they fall
To be real I don't think you feel me at all
Can you hear me at all? can you steer me at all? ...to the liquor store

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
How can I stop, when I'm too far gone
To get back where I came from
I was searching for some answers at a bar with some dancers
And I found out there really ain't none
And the bottom of my glass is just as empty as my last
Encounter with my friends and my loved ones
All my ex's hate my guts, cuz when I finally call them up
They know that I just wanna fuck some
I apologize, for what? I don't know
Too many times I did it and it shows, I feel it in my soul
There's a burning in my stomach and it's churning in slow
And it grows every time I hit a low
If you high I was hoping we could roll
If you fiending for a drink, let me pour
If you riding maybe we can go
Before they close - to the liquor store

[Hook]

[Outro]
So I sit here, and I think back on all the things I wanted in life and all the things that I've accomplished
I'm more fulfilled then I ever have been before
I still lose - I've still lost, but I love, and I'm living
There's nothing better in this world than to be for sure
And I'm sure - I'm sure enough in what I do, and how I do it
There's a lot of people around me that believe in me
And I depend on them to see me through this - this life of mine
Lets hope this journey that we take
All these moves that we make
Are the right ones...while I meditate[Verse 1]
I graduated, nominated most highly anticipated
Rapper out the underground
My resume, I run it down
No budget, I'm still on the rise
See hoes on, raised the vibe
Just touched down met my connects, I myself give 'em hell now
You can't rap, I always snap so who you think gon' sell now?
Type of flow that I endorse Obama couldn't bail out
History remembers kings your kids will live to tell about
My legacies, Saint John's walk the earth, I'll be their Everkings
My angel wings up on my Chevy, swear my swag was heaven sent
Pardon me, I dumb it down cause we not the intelligent
Mississippi nigga, how could I be oh so arrogant
Cause ten times out of ten your favorite rapper's probably scared of me
Ok, now even I don't measure up, I'm light years ahead of me
I been deep in this game, fuck everything else irrelevant
I'm married to my money, no pre nuptials or settlements
A king of my own land I stand, ask you who's all better than
Krizzle![Intro]
Woo hell yeah, let's talk to the niggas that do the most
I'm here, back again
It's your boy [?]
For the record, I like [?]
Ya heard?
And that's how we do it, for the record

[Chorus: Buddy]
This is for the record (hey)
This is for the record (hey)
Hell yeah
This is for the record (hey)
This is for the record (hey)
Hell yeah

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Hey, man I'm in this whole wire
Stay up, I don't ever get tired
Heat it up, with a little more fire
Headed up, we can only get higher
Man, your girl give me head, like a visor
I ain't fuck that bitch, she a liar
You ain't heard that I roll with the writers
Give it up bruh, you don't wanna try us
Every time I hit the road, they be linin' up
All these hoes see me on, now they signin up
Gettin' money, I'm a sole proprietor
Keep on sleepin' if you want, man, that's fine with us
Back it up one time for a nigga
Mix a little bam-bam with the liquor
No, we don't got no problems over here bruh
And we gon' touch a mil' before the year is up

[Chorus: Buddy]
This is for the record (hey)
This is for the record (hey)
Hell yeah
This is for the record (hey)
This is for the record (hey)
Hell yeah

[Bridge: Buddy]
Money on my mind, for the record
Runnin' through the marathon, for the record
And I put that on God, for the record
Somebody might die, for the record
Rest in peace, nigga Eazy-E, for the record
Mike & Keys, nigga on the beat, for the record
We could do this all night, for the record
Comin' from the Westside, for the record

[Verse 3: Boogie]
This one for the pressure
This one for the bitches, that ain't givin' me no effort
This one for the L, shit they only made me better
They remember every fade, and sayin' this one for the record
I can't rectify the pain or the story of my gang
Ain't no freedom for my brain, with a 40 and a chain
You know devils love to play, in the shadows of my brain
I can't elevate or change, if all I ever do is hang
Really, all I see is shame
"Where my city at?"
Nigga, you too broke for you to know where all the bitches at
Homie on parole and he can't smoke, so he gon' hit a Black
You let somebody use your lighter, you don't get it back
I'm really at...I'm really in a bad place, and I ain't seein' good much
Tell me throw my fist high and I just throw my hood up
How you know your roof high, if you ain't ever looked up (uh)
Some shit I never understood
But I know this one for the record, I know this one for the death
They'll have niggas spendin' money 'fore we even see the check
Serena made it outta' Compton, she forever get respect
A parallel to how ya'll sit and do it for the 'net
I say...
This is for the record

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'
For the record...
It ain't nothing like fucking with [?] and you ain't got to motherfucking split it wit nobody, nigga. And that's really for the record, nigga
I put that muthafuckin' money in my pocket and I know, shit, I [?]
That's on God, nigga, for the recordOh willkommen, willkommen sonnenschein!

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Sick and tired of these bills every month
Made a little money but it ain't enough
Sick and tired of these niggas, God is my witness
No job so they out here robbing and stealing
Sick and tired of being broke, I need a smoke
Done working a 9 to 5, I don't want to go
Sick and tired of the streets, I need to leave
Wish I could just bounce but it ain't cheap
There's gotta be a better way
For me to get paid today
Got to get some money, need to get some money
Can I get some money? Let me get some money
Get the money

[Pre-Chorus: Buddy]
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey, yeah)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Niggas)

[Chorus: Buddy]
Add it up
So it's a growing process. I'm not what I should be
Add it up
But when I look back on my life, I'm not what I used to be
Add it up
God ain't through with me yet. Anybody in the transformation stages?
Add it up
Anybody being transformed?

[Post-Chorus: Buddy]
I can't do what I want 'cause
I can't just afford to
I ran out of luck, my
Paycheck ain't enough, damn
Been working all week, sleep
I ain't had a week, drink
I need me a fe-ew
My rent almost due

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Broke find broke, we ain't got it
Nothing but lent up in my pocket
Need new kicks but I can't cop it
When we hit the mall, we window shopping
Yeah, what's in yo' wallet?
Say you getting money, well, I can't call it
Why you lying? Nigga, you ain't balling
You broke as I am, you ain't got it
Stop it, stop it
We need that profit, profit
Tryna make that double, double
Because it's never enough

[Pre-Chorus: Buddy]
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey, yeah)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, we from the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Hey)
Can I get a witness?
Oh yeah, still in the hood, we ain't going nowhere (Niggas)

[Chorus: Buddy]
Add it up
I can't praise Him enough, you can't stop my praise
Add it up
You don't know my story
Add it up
All the things that I've been through. I'm still here
Add it up
Only by the grace of God, I'm still here

[Post-Chorus: Buddy]
I can't do what I want 'cause
I just can't afford to
I ran out of luck, my
Paycheck ain't enough, damn
Been working all week, sleep
I ain't had a week, drink
I need me a fe-ew
My rent almost due

[Outro]
I got more clothes than I can wear
I got more shoes than I can wear
Got stuff I ain't gon' wear no more
Still hanging in the closet, that's just some material stuff
Look at the spiritual blessing
Because God have been too good to me
Have He been good to you?
Come on, give him a praise in the house[Verse 1: Buddy]
First time I'd seen that girl
Said I need that girl, and
Every time I see that girl
Can't believe that girl, cause
She fine and she brown
And she thick in the butt, but
She be walking around, with a stick in her butt
Talking about everything that nigga do in my life
And how I ain't doing it right, and
I'm was trying to do what it do for the night
But she ain't in the mood for the night, nah
She be acting rude in the middle of the room
And she really ain't cute when she fight, she
Told me she don't like it when I go to the stu'
But I told her to get used to the life, and
That's when I said I'm about to leave
Than she said boy oh no you don't
Now she all yelling in my ear
I'm like girl you should slow your roll
Now this girl scratch me on my arm
I just start heading towards the door
God damn man I know I'm a Star
And it's kind of bizarre
Let me hop in the car, cause

[Hook: Buddy]
Ooh baby girl you got me agitated, agitated
Ooh baby girl you got me agitated, agitated
Let's hit rewind because I'm going out my mind
You best be lucky that you so fine
Because if you wasn't girl I wouldn't put up with it
[X2]

(Damn, she scratch me and I'm bleeding. I'm gonna get out of here man.)

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Now my car seat is cold, but I'm off on the road
And my girlfriend at home, feeling lost and alone
So she calls on the phone but she's talking a bunch, and
Only thing I could think, it's probably that time of the month, she
Talking pretty fast and she sound really mad
Because she's trying to get it all off her chest, I
Hang up in her face in the middle of the place
Now she's trying to send it all in a text, one
More paragraph in all caps
Talking about how I'm still involved with my ex, than
I reply back because I really had to ask if she even had a heart in her chest, now
She's crying and it's kind of getting all up in my vertebrae
And plus she's whining so I can't understand half the words she say
And now it's getting kind of late
I don't know where I'm supposed to lay
Running gas while I'm on the road
But I think it's time that I go home
Even though you wrong, girl I won't be long
With a love so strong, can't break our bond
But let me ask you baby, why must you agitate me?
Just look how mad you made me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
What's your name? I forgot
It's your man, Mikey Rocks
I got the spot that you can't have
Pop a cap in your fake ass
Banco popular, get your binoculars
And get a good look while we're riding by you
Just glad I can lend a hand to all the little niggas I inspire
Even when it's down to the wire
When they put the flames to the fryer
Hop out of the pan into the fire
You can have everything that you desire
I can put you to bed, you feel tired
I wanna see you sweat and perspire
You the life of the party and I hope you stay
They paid to put your name on the flyer
God damn I'm on her like a cop-cop
She's middle class with some ass and she talks proper
A jaw dropper for sure I'm in the Cayman
But I'm thinking I should hardtop her
Mix it with the hard vodka
What's up, What's up just fuck me right
The naked truth is better than the best dressed lie
I know you're tired of waiting, that shit be aggravating
But I don't got the patience, that shit be agitating, yeah

[Bridge: Buddy]
Baby knows she's bad, Baby knows she's bomb
So even if I'm mad, I'm going to stay calm
But let me ask you baby, why must you agitate me?
Just look how mad you made me

[Hook][Verse 1]
Aye, it's been a long day
"Buddy, can you ease my mind?" what she told me
Now I got her posted up in my domain
And I'm lightin' up the fire with the propane
In the background, listenin' to Cocaine
Friends came through, then we hear the soul train
Sub bass kickin' down the doorframe
'93 baby, listenin' to the Old Daze, Hub City raised me
Notice niggas don't change, do this on the daily
Don't it sound crazy?
Flyin' outta town, can you hear me now, baby?
Be back in the wild, I've been goin' wild lately
Then it's goin' down like one o'clock in the morn'
Cell phone ring ring, so I pick up
Homeboy talkin' 'bout a party we should hit up
First we gotta clean the fit up, peep the getup
Marijuana and the liquor make you hiccup
East Coast, smokin' the la-la-la
Niggas up north came here to vibe tonight
Niggas down south know they wanna get high tonight
B-U-double D, makin' sure that I roll this blunt tight

[Hook]
Huh, now who got a light?
Aye, do you got a light?
Yo, who got a light?
Man, I'm tryna light this blunt
Aye, who got a light?
Yo, do you got a light?

You ain't tryna hit my blunt, it's too strong
It's too strong

[Verse 2]
Just another West Coast nigga on the come up
Smokin' on kush, finna roll another blunt up
You could still cut your head up and get wet up
YG says shut up, get your bread up
Back of the Lyft, baby packin' a spliff
She keep talkin' that shit, but I'm not tryna hear it
Headed out to the hills, got a bag full of thrills
Other hand full of bills, yeah we do this for real
All the homegirls makin' sure the hoes act right
All the homeboys rollin' up kush in the back
Come with me baby if you want that pipe
But we finna hotbox, you might catch a contact tonight
Baby, you should let me get inside your life
I could take you to the crib and massage ya right
Let me see your breasts, I won't chastise ya
I could get you wet, baby let me baptize ya
I'm a west side Hub City rider
Rhymin', young nigga smokin' on ganja
Grindin', gettin' to the money, no problem
Dollars, that's the only thing in my pockets

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
She say "Why you dye your hair?", cause it's not alive
Get it, it has no life so it has to die
Plus I'm the mad hatter, your favorite actress back cracker
I know black hackers, and financial fat backers
But still I'm a back packer, who knows trappers
And gat packers, and eleven mac packers
There will be your life with a permanent dimple
Pussy is my teacher I'm a nympho for the info
Straight from my mental
I draw pictures upon my temple, Sharpie pen not pencil
I'm sorry now what I'm into, why I love all things that's oriental?
I'll take the golden diamonds and dip 'em all around my dental
Cause I like it bitch
If you knew that then I guess that means you psychic, shit
All the picky Cuban chain, right there's a bitch
You are out of your stature, watch what you ask for
Niggas you cannot break me crack me, or fracture
A scratch out of your zone tighten your corset
Comme Des Garcons, tuxedo short set with the bow tie
You know why, of course I am so high
All creativity, I'm comparable to no guy
Your girl says "Oh, hi!", look at her staring cute
You jump off a bridge, I'm still holding your parachute
You fly, right?

[Hook]
Grind hard far is today go
Shine hard far as the pay go
Ball hard as far as they know
As far as they know, oh

As far as they know

My intangibility mixed in with my agility
Seems to be the reason why most these niggas ain't feelin me
But their fragility mixed in with the virginity is like
The main reason why me in the manasili see
Simmy seems the most venomous spitter in the premises
Was crashed the mission to call you my nemesis
I'm a sinner, you can find me where are the sinners is use the beginner
I'm a section you are virginicies and see
Before you judge and get the talking you're talking just remember
You the defender so nigga you gon' have to surrender
Cause call me the number one contain the hell
And all the way from counting in my chain from Virginia
My birthday in September so she make sure she limber
And right before I chop it down I'll be screaming out "Timber!"
I'm the abominable biological diabolical
Take a look at my follicles if you're not frightened

Where the beat go "boom boom boom boom"
Ya'll know ya'll lose it

Won't be no truce, won't be no truce
At your funeral in an all-black suit
Couple white girls rocking all-black too
Million Man March in the all-black boots
Call up the troops, call up the troops
Punch you in the mouth, they'll knock out your tooth
I can tell when they not tellin' the truth
Talkin' that shit, nigga, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do? What you gon' do?
Back and I'm black and I'm actin' brand new
Niggas in the back like, "Oh, word"
Diamonds all black like fuck what you heard
Fuck what you heard, fuck what you heard
Spillin' some Hennessy Black on the curb
Just for the memory of the deceased
When I black out, I awaken the beast

Willie got a lynch, head in that
If you black you dead in that
Strange fruit hang from a tree
On the leaves is red and that
Do it right like a Garveyite
Africa, I'm heading back
Niggas in the street, black on black
Kill him with the heat (Bah, bah, bah, bah)
Cut off his feet (Put him in the shackles)
Mansa Musa been had the cash
Mix blacks to dilute blacks
Don't want blacks to produce blacks
Take black and they boot that
Orange is the new black

Four hundred years of oppression
I'm about to get me that black Tesla
Black skid marks on the pavement
Cops wanna see me in a black cage

Got cop lights behind me, damn, I hope they don't kill me like whoosh ahh
Calm down, rubbin' on my temples

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm smokin' and drinkin' all by myself
Hopin' and wishin' I find myself
In the late night catchin' a vibe by myself
Lord willin' we don't die tonight we gon' fly tonight
And I fly by myself
Realizin' that I can't hide from myself
Close my eyes just to see what's inside of myself
I cry by myself

[Chorus]
Lost and alone
Come find me
I just wanna feel loved
Come try me
Lost and alone

[Verse 2]
My sister say I'm changing a lot
Someone by the water finally made it straight outta Compton
Father callin' me like "Son we hardly see you at all
Yeah I know you out here shinin' but you can't do it all by yourself"
And I can hear the voice of my mom, tellin' me to pray for understanding, wisdom and knowledge
Wish I knew what I know now back when I dropped out of college
Sometimes I feel like I can have way more shit accomplished
It don't matter cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm smokin' and drinkin' all by myself
Hopin' and wishin' I find myself
In the late night catchin' a vibe by myself
Lord willin' we don't die tonight we gon' fly tonight
And I fly by myself
Realizin' that I can't hide from myself
Close my eyes just to see what's inside of myself
I cry by myself

[Chorus]
Lost and alone
Come find me
I just wanna feel loved
Come try me
Lost and alone[Intro]
When I close my eyes, then I free myself
No matter where I'm at, I just be myself
I can't see myself, I can't see myself
I can't see myself, I can't see myself
Yeah, shit
First I break it down, then I roll it up, yeah
Then I light it up, now I'm smokin' again
Take a little puff, then I breathe it all, in (Shit)
Pray father forgive, everyday I'm sinnin
Take it to the end, this just the beginnin'
Yeah
It's some shit I haven't seen yet
Shit, I can't see myself yet
Named gettin' bigger, yeah
Shit
This one for my city, yeah
Holla if ya hear me, yeah
Sing

[Verse 1]
Yo
If it wasn't for my reflection, I would be forever guessin'
Swear I got a billion questions
The essence of adolescence is purity
The homie told me, "Sacrifices come wit' maturity"
And it's clear to me now
Rest in peace to those not here wit' me now
If my granny saw this day, would shed a tear for me now
If my uncle saw this day, would come and give me a pound
Like, "Damn nephew, you really did that shit, wow"
Take a look around, I'm comin' from a town that most people don't make it out
The shit that I think about, the people I hang around
The things that I've seen that influenced me since a little child
It's trippin' me out
I mean, who can I be, other than me? (Nobody)
Shit, what would I do if I was you? (No clue)
Man, where'd I come from? Where do I go?
Mirror, mirror on the wall, let a nigga know
'Cause

[Chorus]
I can't see myself, I can't see myself
When I close my eyes, then I free myself
No matter where I'm at, I just be myself, yeah, yeah
(Come find me)
I can't see myself, I can't see myself
When I'm all alone (I just wanna feel loved)
I don't need no help, I believe myself (Yeah)
Smokin' and drinkin' all by myself (Uh-huh)
Hopin' and wishin' I find myself (Come find me)
Lord willin' we won't die tonight, we gon' fly tonight

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Okay I'm sittin' here, tryna think of the exact words for me to explain to you
That it is what it is and that's what it's gon' be
Ain't no changin' me (Nope)
Ain't no "maybe"s and no "probably"s, I gotta be (Myself)
That's what it has to be, I'm happily, gladly, gradually
Changin' reality for my family
They proud of me
Could've, never imagined or fathomed things that had happened
The good, the bad, and the tragic
The happy moments, the sad ones, the classics
My first time in Miami
Pharrell had me out on Collins Ave in studio rappin'
The last nigga signed to Star Trak, might get that shit tatted
And then we shriveled up the contract, and still keep in contact
We beyond all that bullshit and that nonsense, and besides that
I ain't gettin' that time back
Niggas know where my heart's at
I just gotta move on, shit
Gotta get my own shit
So I pray with all my might
I walk by faith, and not by sight
Because

[Chorus]
I can't see myself, I can't see myself, yeah
I can't see myself, I can't see myself
When I close my eyes, then I free myself, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah[Hook]
Pull up in a limousine
Lookin' like a guillotine
Sippin' on that Hennessy
What you know about me?

[Verse 1]
Back to the first time
Nothin' like the last time
Waitin' 'til the next time
That'll be the best time
Never been the worst time
Never do rehearse mine
Never disrespect mine
When I get the check
I'ma tell 'em double check mine
Them I'm finna cash out
Now I'm finna smash out
Ride with the top down
Baby, get that ass out
Drop it really fast
Gonna burn all the gas out
Lookin' at the dash like damn, might crash
'Cause we maxin' out
Thought you heard I'm the nigga that they ask about
Got a pocket full of ones and I pass 'em out
To all the hoes on the poles, once they slide down
Oh, keep shakin'
The flows everlasting
Stop, you can't make it
I'm goin' to VIP
Get lost in the moment

[Verse 2]
Ain't no particular way to get to it
If anybody get in the way, then we move 'em
Nigga, I ain't finna debate with you, losers
Way too busy gettin' the cake
What you doin'? Foolin'
Had you a grip but you blew it, stupid
Look at your bitch 'cause she choosin' stupid
Taking her too where my crew is coolin'
Hop in the whip, girl, we cruisin'
You can ride for the night, baby girl
I know what you like
Always on top
Fall off, nah, never that
Introduce you to new things you don't know about
I ain't never had hoop dreams, went another route
Still made it happen, little bit of rappin'
Money keep stackin'
Ready for that action
She gon' do a bad thing
Shakin' with a passion
I'ma throw that cash in, fashion

[Outro: Kent Jamz]
Granny used to tell me, "Boy, don't look back"
That was '96, I was bumpin' Outkast
She was up in church like, "Hallelujah"
Now it's getting scary, Freddy Krueger[Verse 1]
I’m inspired, I make magic, like Harry does
I’m a king coming live like Larry bruh
Getting money, paper stress like a pair of plugs
Popping like a cherry before I knew what a cherry was
Kinda scary, huh?
But coming straight out of Compton, growing up, everybody knew who Mary was
I didn’t meet her till about 14, whole team
Smoking protein, tryna keep it low key
Huh, so just a piff quickly, times I’m feeling low
I got this to lift me
And I’m chilling with a chick that used to diss
Now she blowing smoke in my mouth just so she can kiss me
You can find me in my city, kicking it with my niggas
Twisting that sticky icky and I lay it down flat
Like girls with idy bidly, you feel me

[Hook]
I’m inspired, don’t mess with me or my paper
Cause I be riding round in my scraper
Call your girl cause I’m gonna take her
When she come to my city
It’s fine, I’m a ball and [?] she tryna lay up
You wanna blow with me, you gotta pay up
Cause I’m supposed to be a player
Say that dum dum did ye, inspired

[Verse 2]
Cloud 9 is my residence, mom’s on me like "you better quit"
Still twisting up the heavens of medicine on my 44th joint
Now I’m feeling like the president
Cause ever since a baby I’ve been running round crazy
Like I had attention deficit
So any time I wanna chill, I twist up the Kill Bill
Couple hits then I will sit still
Far from average, back when I had basis
Blowing smoke out of my brackets
NBA balling, white and red baskets
In the car getting blown, I’m a head gasket
Now listen clear, you got a problem
I know what can make it disappear
It’s called "kush" cause it keeps us sitting here, for years

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Uh ah, oh, oh, uh ah, oh, oh, yeah
Uh ah, oh, oh, uh ah, oh, oh, yeah
Dum dum did ye

[Verse 3]
Baby say she into the sipping, but what I got get you distant
Here’s a song to play when you just trynna kick it
Get some chicks and light a spliff at 4 o'clock and 20 minutes
Hm, the simple fact that I’m upper
Makes me feel like I am other
Child rebel soldier, but I still do good
If you tryina feel how I feel, baby you should
You should come and get with us
I don’t need a vacation, I want the inspiration
It’s the simple stuff we love
And no matter what we face
We always keep it basic, it’s a simple here
You know, you know
Rhymes could be everywhere, hello, hello
When that subliminal it’s fine
And it don’t matter how I say it
Only how you take it

[Hook]

[Bridge][Intro]
Yeah, hah
This is for my number one chick
Yeah
This is for my number one chick

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I know you like it
Ooh, I know you love it
Ooh, I know you can't deny
Ooh, I know you want it
Girl, I know you need
This love that I got in your life
Ooh, I know you nasty
Yeah, you know I’m nasty
Girl, you know that ass is mine
Ooh, I cannot wait 'til you get to my place
So we can do our thing tonight

[Chorus]
Ooh, you make me feel like I'm a brand new person, ooh
When I wake up right next to you, I know it’s love
I know that it's love
I know that it's love
I know it's love, yeah (Ayy, let's dance)

[Verse 2]
Put my hand in your hand (Ayy), put your hand in mine
Now we're spinnin' and we're twirlin’ (Yeah), glidin’ left to right (Let's dance)
And you’re more than just my girlfriend, more than just my wife (That's right)
Baby, you are the love of my life (Straight up)

[Bridge]
Drop that thing for love (Make it drop, ayy)
Drop that thing for love (Make it clap, uh)
Back that ass up for love (Back that ass up)
Drop that thing for love (Know I love that)
Drop that thing for love (You know I love that)
Back that ass up for love (Back that ass up)
Clap that thing for love (Make it clap, love)
Throw that ass back for love (Throw it back)

[Chorus]
Ooh, you make me feel like I'm a brand new person, ooh
When I wake up right next to you, I know it's love
I know that it’s love
I know that it's love
I know it's love, yeah (Nephew, let 'em know some')

[Interlude]
Icky, icky, icky, slime
Icky, icky, icky, rodeo
Icky, icky, icky, slime
Icky, icky, icky, rodeo

[Outro]
Everyone longs for love
Everyone want to capture that love feeling
That true love, that special love
The love that flows from heart to heart
And breath to breath
That inspires
That motivates you to be better
Once you find true love
You don't ever want to lose
I love you, you love me
You and me in love
Yeah[Intro]
Daaaamn, last time I seen her she was

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Last time I saw you, you was workin' out at the Slauson 24
Last time I saw you, you was tellin' me that you still searchin' for more (uh)
Bad bitches galore, I get it
Bad bitches link up, I get it
Ass shot, titty-job
Look, I get it
Everybody should know, I hit it twice, on everything (everything)
I want it in, on everything (everything)
Two seater, never win her by any means
Ass shot, titty-job, no wedding ring (wedding ring)

[Verse 1: Buddy & Kent Jamz]
Wait...
Elevator [?], top floor, penthouse suite, Encore, LV
Babygirl twenty-three, lookin' like she eighteen
Pull out the I.D., lemme' see, never get the best of me
You ain't gotta' lie to kick it (naaaah)
Babygirl', you ain't gotta ask permission (yeah)
I'm just trynna' figure out yo' addiction
Why you keep popping all those prescriptions?
And she got her hair all wavy
Nails done up all crazy
Grandma watching her baby
Eyes all hazy
Sleepin' all day, so lazy
When she wake up, she just wanna get drunk
She just wanna have fun
Wanna hit the club
She just wanna get fucked, yeah

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Last time I saw you, you was workin' out at the Rio Equinox
Last time I saw you, you was tellin' me how you couldn't get enough
Why? (Yeah)
You can't tell me why (Yeah)
Why I can't come over?
Why you won't let me inside it
You say you know what I want
I know what you need (Yeah)
You say if I come over, we gon' fuck all night
We gon' fuck all day and all night

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Yo
Girl I know you don't belong to me
But your man ain't here and I'm tryna take you home with me
Last time that I saw you, working on squats in the gym
Like you tryna keep it tone for me
Baby girl give it all to me
Yeah I see that nigga callin'
But it don't really bother me
Won't you come take a walk with me, talk to me
Put it on top of me, rock with me
Now we 'bout to get a little messy
Fuckin' up the bed sheets
Baby girl you get me
Know it's been a little while since you met me
Maybe you should let me
Hit it to the melody
Okay then, look at my eyes soon as I grip on them thighs
Don't run, just take it in stride
You can't fake it if you try, baby

[Bridge: Buddy]
Yeah
I know you like it (Yeah)
I know you like it (Yeah)
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it (Get on top)
Slow ride it (Hit it from the back)
Slow ride it
Slow ride it, slow ride it, slow ride it
Yeah, act like you know, act like you know
When you're alone, when you're alone
Just call my phone, just call my phone
Yeah, last time I saw you...

Last time I seen her... I tried not to seen her because I'm like hol' up, is that her? Do you see? Oh, there she go right there...do you see her? Aye, aye, aye, aye...[Verse]
Hey (Legend), everyone wants to be (Legend)

Don't try me, please (Legend)
Down in history (Legend)

Whatever's clever, nigga, know we way ahead of niggas
They always rappin' like they tryin' to be better than you
But it's evident they'll never be the president, I'm tellin' you
I deserve a medal, nigga
Just to cop at a condom at 7-Eleven
'Cause I'm better than that, and I'm tellin' you that
These bitches, these bitches, these bitches, these bitches

[Verse 2: Bas]
These bitches givin' it up, let's keep it a buck
My heart like a key in the truck, I'm keepin' it tucked
My heart like a key in the truck, I'm keepin' it tucked
My heart like a key in the truck, I'm keepin' it...
My niggas not givin' a fuck, let's keep it a buck

Amazon Prime for the fast track, yeah
Niggas in the hood tryna grab that, yeah
Follow the track before you add that, yeah
I don't need a confirmation to tell 'em that I'ma smash that
You can get stuck out in traffic
Even when you're in your own lane
Gettin' money like Bruce so I guess I'm a slave to my own Wayne
Hoes dance to the soul of they own train
Wanna blow me down like Coltrane
Or match with the king of the hill like propane
Baby got nerve on her like Cobain
Even when I spill game, bet you that I won't stain up

[Verse 4: JID]
This feels like nothin'
But everything at the same time
Same trouble in the grave, I'm napalm bomb
Every time make love
You may say I'm a little bit out of my mind, I don't mind
I don't be racin' for time, I'm alive
I lift a lot, a liquid drop
Love gives a sentence, stitch the block
Since an infant, my intent senses witness, vivid
Shit I shouldn't be dealin' with it but it's killin' it
My third trip, am I trill enough for the trilogy?
Truck in the path and you trippin'
I'm finna go chat with the I-10, bye ten
Even Benjamin Banneker be fuckin' up the math, I...
Alright, that's all I wrote

Thinkin' 'bout the throne
While I'm in the sittin' chair
And I don't know when I'll get there
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, just know I'm headin' for that
Big red bone is 'bout to bring the crown
I'm at the top floor and I can't come down
Now that's tight, yeah that's tight

[Verse 1]
Now let me tell you what I think is dope
How I get paid checks just to say what I want
Also got plenty of different chicks that I kick it with
And we be kissin' and holdin' hands
Smashin' and crash through clothes
Never flew first, but I have flew coach
Never got caught, but I have been close
And I never been rich, but I have been broke

And it's sad when you pull into the club with your shawty
Knowin' I just took her, so glossy
All I gotta do to get her to go naughty
Is walk into the booth and then they can go potty
Damn and I run this thang like a stampede
So much smoke, that a nigga can't breathe
All ya girlfriends still tryin' to date me
I'm red lobster, you're shrimp scampi, and I

Gotta tell ya somethin', hope it don't discourage y'all
It's my first act, and your crowd is clappin' for curtain call
Step through my mind, and I promise that you gon' be surprised
We're more alike than you realize, and I'm

And as soon as I came in
That's when new women start actin' all
Turnt up off that alcohol
We about to have a ball
Hoes on their toes cause they know I'm G'd up
And Pharrell's seen close, so I'm BBC'd up
Turn on ya TV's and you probably see us
And a lot of people think do you double these silks

Shucks, maybe I should let it go or
Quit racin' and turn applications into the Home Depot (naw)
That'll never happen, no it can't be
Workin' at a farm, sorry it ain't me
Besides I'm out here doin' my thing
And I proceed like, "Nigga, what's a Plan B?"

And them other niggas so sloppy
Plus they really mean to new niggas, so cocky
Look at magazines, and them niggas go copy
I'm only a teen, and I know that they won't stop me

All because I'm in the zone
Sittin' in church while I'm thinkin' 'bout thrones
Convertin' them thoughts 'til they turn into songs
I am dog, throw me a bone

[Hook]
Thinkin' 'bout the throne
While I'm in the sittin' chair
And I don't know when I'll get there
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, just know I'm headin' for that
Big red bone is 'bout to bring the crown
I'm at the top floor and I can't come down
Now that's tight, yeah that's tight

Man, I’ve been rapping for a while now

Every time we would have a little pow wow
Grab the iPod, plug it in the iSlide
Go ahead, cut the beat on
And I'm spitting hardball off top of the dome
But right before would I go, I be like

Hit me with that one more time, I be like
Hit me with that one more time, I be like
Hit me with that one more time, I be like
The next time I see you

[Verse 1: Buddy]
I think I’m about to get my barking on
Hopping out the middle of the water when I’m tryna get my dolphin on
Walk around the corner just to get a Swisher ‘fore a niggas pops get home
Caution homie, cause a nigga flow sick so
Every single thing I put a coughin' on is in a coffin, often
Plotting on how to make a little more cake with a little more frosting on it
Beats slap cause I got a martain on it
Aiming at my target then I'm launching on it
Then I’m flying off in a spaceship with a big sign on the side that say Compton on it
Uh, so don’t be gawking to me when you’re walking to me, talking to me
You don’t know how shocked I'mma be
You gon' be lost, standing there like, uh, well, um
Yeah, yeah, someone should have told y’all Buddy boy in this here
So I'm telling every single one of y'all, remember this date
Then check up on a nigga next year, yeah
Watch out, watch out, cause I think I’m about to switch gears
Smash on the gas, lemme fix my mirrors
And when a nigga pass, I’mma be like, yeahhh

My rent is due on the 1st, I keep on breakin' my phone
Tickets on my car window, I can't take this shit no more
I ain't thinkin' about you, way too focused on my dreams
I need less of what I want, I want more of what I need
Listen up, I got a little confession, I got some problems with women

Because I'm still tryna figure out if I'm livin' right

Back to where the pearly gates be
And I been counting down the days because I know we gotta die soon
That just means I get to fly soon
And I know I'm not the only one out here that's not afraid
Alright, alrighty, well I'm finally on my way

And if I don't hurry, I might be too late
Even with all of this darkness in my grave

Ever since I was a little baby this has been amazing
Thankful for the life you gave me
With every step and every breath know that I been living by you
Lord, just tell me, what should I do?
And I been counting down the days 'cause pretty soon this will be all gone
And your the one that I'ma call on
That's how I know I'll be free and won't be locked inside a cage
Alright, alrighty, now I'm finally on my way

[Verse 3]
Raised in the ghetto
I promised my family, told them that I'm 'bout to take it a whole 'nother level
These niggas that stay in my city be getting all cozy but I never settle
And I'm making my way to heaven while all of my homies been facing the Devil
And speak of the Devil
That nigga tryna get in my brain
So I roll my weed to ease my mind a bit, mind a bit
Sometimes I pace myself and take my time with it, time with it
Plus I be staying on track like a locomotive and I'm planning to make it
So it doesn't matter if you never notice a man in the making
And I close my eyes sometimes and dive in a pool of my dreams
And I been searching far and high and wide until I found my wings
You gotta be crazy if you say you fly as high as I do
As soon as I make it to the pearly gates I'm praying that they gon' open up

[Chorus]
I still can't help but shine (Shining)
I can't help but shine (Shining)
I still can't help but shine (Shining)
And we can't help but shine (Shining)
I can't help it
(I'm shining, you see it, ayy)
I can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ayy, ayy)
I still can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ayy)
And we can't help but shine
(I'm shining, you see it, ayy, ayy)
I can't help it[Verse 1]
Followed you home
Won't leave you alone
Then why'd you leave?
Keeping the bar warm's
Better by far
Your quiet company

[Pre-Chorus]
You're golden lights on a one-way flat sign
(You're golden lights on a one-way flat sign)
Now that you know how to let go, let go of me

[Chorus]
Slow light down
Thinking it away
Then give it away
Then give it away, ah

[Post-Chorus]
Slow light down

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the bed
You made mistakes that nobody sees
But you're too smart
To remember at all, to my envy

[Pre-Chorus]
You're golden lights on a one-way flat sign
(You're golden lights on a one-way flat sign)
Despite what they said, it isn't love if you're not ashamed

[Chorus]
Slow light down
Then show me the way
Then show me the way
Then show me the way, ah
(You're golden lights on a one-way flat sign
You're golden lights on a one-way flat sign)
Slow light down
Then show me the way
Then show me the way
Then show me the way, ah

According to you cause we do?
The number one cutie everytime you roll a doobie
And look, I'm feeling the feather

Just set up the TP for a week three

She would brag 'bout the blunts that she roll
So I told her to show me, Hey
So I'm already goin' in the moment
I'm about to get the chonies, Hey
The chick with the J on her lips
Got a bong, proceeded into taking a rip
Blew an O, just to let her know
That she's willing to roll
Baby, come home we can take a dip
Trust me, Trust me, Trust me
We can go wherever you want
Baby, please don;t rush me, Nine times out of ten, baby
You got a ten, If you down to put it in we can get it in

[Chorus]
I'm sending out smoke signals
And I'm sure you can see them, Westcoast
Come chief for me girl
Lets Smoke, we'll be hanging out up in the clouds
There's no way that we can come down
Go, come chief with girl

Now I'm back fo' some mo', oh fo' sure
Hey, I'm at a loss for words

Everybody sleep, we should quiet it down, we a lil' bit loud
I'm in and out, in and out, strokin' you up and down, all around
Pushin' your head to the south side 'til ya knees hit the ground and ya face down
I bet it's hard to talk wit' my dick in ya mouth
You be suckin' me up
Feels so good, it be shuttin' me up
Can't put it in, got me ready to nut

See silence is golden baby, and duct tape is silver
I rest my head on the pillow and then you shh

Staircases take me high
Escalators take me high
Ladders take me high
Elevators take me high

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Started at the surface so my goal is up
Cause once you stay down then you gon' get stuck
And I'm just trying to climb and grind, the same time
Dangling off rooftops is what I call our hangtime
Walking through the hall, counting my flaws
My ego got caught in a elevator wall
Got it out, raised it to the rooftop, damn
Got to take the ladder cause the escalators jammed
Made it to the top but I ain't even stopping
I said a prayer and a wish and turned my skateboard to a rocket
I'm gone, to the skies, I'm nothing more than another rebel
But I'm still trying to take it to another level
Get up out the ghetto, maybe hop up on the shuttle
Jello with a piece of metal, my foot on the pedal
People say the world could fit into a little pebble
Then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
(Let's get it off)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
Deep inside my pupils the aliens camouflaged
Another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
I'll drop a gallon of Henny in the Big Dipper then dive
Bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
Ever seen a Martian? Gorgeous or some U.F.O. Porsches
I live inside the air plus I wear Air Jordans
So the mic is always near me whether swaggin' or recordin'
Journey on my voyage, you know the sky is the limit
But it's ironic that method never applied to Kendrick
I catapult over your telescope and when I'm finished
I grab the fire that's burning from Mars to light an incense
This rapping's just a metaphor and I deserve a medal for
Writing another metaphor, about ambition
I envision me taking off astronautin' myself
Fuck the world, I'll beat that bitch with the Orion's belt

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Buddy]
As I'm floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone
Getting high so I'm not sinking
As I'm floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone
Getting high so I'm not sinking
Getting high so I'm not sinking

Hey, ooh baby, you caught me off guard
I never had a love quite like yours
And it's hittin' me down in my core
First I had doubts, now I'm sure
Yeah, and I never thought that it would be like this before
You're the one I adore
Let me love you some more

I feel the magic when I'm kissin' you
This is somethin' new, ooh

Get a shot of Moscato and lil' mama get slutty
On the real, though
Let me tell you how I feel, though
She ain't fuckin' with no weirdo
So back the fuck up out my face
Straight out the bottle, I don't need no chase

Surprise, open your eyes, peek-a-boo

Oh, you wanna roll with the big dawgs?
Smoke a little 'dro with the big dawgs? (Big dawgs)
Pass that indo
Take one shot then I evolve
Put the tab on your tongue let it dissolve
And you got something to share you can get involved
Listen to Grateful Dead and I'm tripping balls
Hop in that UFO and I lift off, yeah
Fuck yo' plug, fuck yo' drugs
I got my own nigga
Took a stem and a cap to the dome nigga
I ain't been this high since Coachella
New level, I can feel it
Psychedelic
Please do not fuck wit' my energy
Is you my friend or my enemy?
I could do this 'til infinity

[Verse 2: Buddy]
I'm back at it again
I'm comin' down Melrose
Runnin' a checkup for cardio
Smoking Luigi eating at Mario's
Okay, now let's see how far we go
Off the shits when I'm in the studio
Trippin' on acid with Roofeeo
Minds turn into kaleidoscopes
I think I'm goin' delusional
Brain dead, mind gone, warp speed
Flyin' through time zones
Roll a blunt about a mile long
Can a young nigga get his shine on?
Pour the liquor on my tombstone
When I die, bet I get my halo
Cause I aim high, never aim low
Bout to take off like Quavo

I'm sippin'
Sippin' got me twisted up

I'm trippin' out
I'm sippin'
Sippin' got me twisted, up
I'm catching all the energy your givin' out
Layin' on the ceiling, man, I feel like I could touch the clouds
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin' out

Please leave your message-
You supposed to answer the phone when a real one calls
You must be high off drugs if you missin' my calls
What's up with you?
Get yo' life together, nigga
Call me back
You trippin'![Verse 1]
Just so good at being in trouble
Spending my days out in the ghetto
Mama say that I need to be careful
Going downtown on the Blue Line Metro
Car overheated and I can't afford a rental (Shit)
Broke down Chevrolet, sitting on Central
Turning on my headphones looking out the window
Lauryn Hill playing, it could be so simple
Damn, I just can't wait 'til I get on
What the hell is taking so long?

[Chorus]
I wish I had a girl by my side
Wish I had a brand new ride
I wish I had a light
I wish I had a private flight
I wish upon the stars sometimes
I wish I had it right
I wish I had the finer things
I wish I wasn't so Cobain
I wish I had you (Shit)
And I wish I wasn't stuck on Central

[Verse 2]
Just so good at being in trouble
Spending my days out in the ghetto
Papa say that I need to be careful
Heard a nigga just got popped at the Arco
Pros on the hoe stroll, junkies on narcos
Long Beach, Compton, Watts to South Central
Damn, I just can't wait 'til I get home (Shit)
That's when a cop had pulled me over

[Chorus]
I wish I had a girl by my side
Wish I had a brand new ride
I wish I had a light

I wish I wasn't so Cobain
I wish I had you (Shit)
And I wish I wasn't stuck on Central

I wish I was in control
Really wish I wasn't stuck on Central
I still got so far to go, yeah
Won't be stuck here, not for long
Just hold on, hold on

Anytime that I hit the dance-floor, you ain't tryin' battle me bitch!
Start with the right cheek, go to the left cheek, back to the right cheek
All of them ass cheeks, how in the hell did you fit 'em in them damn jeans?

Honestly, I'm floating

Eyes barely open from the weed
Used to smoke 'em with them champs

Yeah, yo
Back in high school I used to catch the train home
Lookin' out the window pane, as it's getting rained on
Listenin' to the beats that's in my headphones
Plugged in to my cell-phone
Tryin' to keep my brain strong
Almost falling asleep, my head drops, nearly missing my stop
But I get up, I get out, started takin' a walk
Saw the cop
Shoulda' bought a ticket, but I did not
Now here's the plot
Trynna' see which fence that I should hop
My feet plop on the pavement
Got away with a lot, they can't phase him
Rollin' up on my pops, stuck in a daze, steady countin' my paper
Got paid, 'round the time I started stretchin' my gauges
I was off to the races
Can't tell nobody how much you got when you gettin' paper
These niggas' always watchin' and grabbin' they calculator
I do not have no time for this, dawg, I'mma see ya' later
Homie, I don't wanna' build with ya'
Hell nah, talkin' 'bout how you a real nigga'
Yeah right, yeah boy, I hear ya' talkin', but I don't trust
Yeah them boys they be jockin', but they ain't us (ain't us)

Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl, yeah

[Verse 3]
Stay on me, stay on me
Baby look like Naomi
Say she wanna run a play on me
Stay ready, stay ready
Lookin' like Halle Berry
You know I stay ready
So I took her to a restaurant, yeah
Told her, order up whatever you want, yeah
And I'm a upper-echelon, yeah
Go and tell the man what else you want, yeah
And I'ma hit it from the back when you
Poke it out like Rihanna
Ooh, girl, you know you wanna
Smokin' on marijuana (ooh, la la la)

[Pre-Hook]
One time, baby girl, I just need one time
Promise you I won't waste no time
I'ma make you love me long time
Oh yeah, bet you ain't never had it like this here
I could show you some whole new things
I'ma make you my new boo thing
Alright, every little thing's gonna be alright
You and I, we can fuck all night
Soon as you let me inside
It's true, I ain't gotta lie to you, baby, it's true
If you ever leave, girl, I'll miss you
Everything I do is all for you, ooh

[Hook]
Wonder Woman, take me to your world of wonders
What's in your world, I wonder?
I wanna go
Ooh, you know I need that
What you got on underneath that?
I wanna know (ooh, la la la)[Chorus]
Betta when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young
Betta when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young
Betta when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young
Better when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young

[Verse 1]
Ayy (Ayyy)
I'm really out here, my nigga (My nigga)
No responsibilities
Fuck the consequences
You can't tell me anything
Nah, never ask permission (Nope, no)
Only ask forgiveness (Yep, yep)
God is my witness (Woop, woop, woop, woop)
Mama say I'm oblivious, daddy think I'm oblivious
Driftin' into oblivion
Buddy back on his bullshit again (Ooh, I'm tellin')
Oh, how I wish I was a kid again
Got a hard time with listenin'
Same problem with discipline
Still gotta get my dividends
It's so much adrenaline
Head is spinnin', I know I'ma sin again

[Chorus]
Betta when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young
Betta when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young

[Bridge]
It's a fine line between love and hate, ya see
Came way too late, and baby, I'm on it
Yeah, it's a fine line between love and hate, ya see
Came way too late, and baby, I'm on it
Can't worry 'bout what another nigga think
Now that's liberation, and baby, I want it
Baby, I want it
Can't worry 'bout what another nigga think
Now that's liberation, and baby, I want it
(Lemme hear, lemme hear, lemme hear those)

[Chorus]
Betta when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young
Betta when ya young
Swear ya betta when ya young

Swear ya betta when ya young[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
...-Like that, It's like this
When you hear the nigga yo he be in a bliss
'Cause I make the rhymes and it's just a easy gist
With a twist, of my nouns and my verbs
Consummated, into a sentence, ease of words
That I'm at (hmm), so amazin', when I'm blazin'
Just like a trip to Portland, Trail Blazer
But yo listen, yo I gotta say it like this
I got the Phife Dawg and he wants to assist
To persist (yeah) with the rhythm (yeah)
Give 'em (yeah) what you got (yeah)
Phife Dawg hop (check it out) off the mic (check it out) and make the joint hot

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Malik Izaak Taylor is the illest rhyme creator
Let me be the first to say; that I be's a player hater
'Cause I hate when emcees play on this device known as a mic
Then have the nerve to even think that their rhymes and they're tight
So I laugh, quietly watching how the industry's bust
All these video sluts, and guys who front like they're tough
All these million-selling rappers with the bogus-like husks
Withew[? 0:48] brothers screaming "Brooklyn!", when they're probably from Lynbrook
And oh, I see hood raps putting 40's to their lips and head
Go out buy a chalice, and they wanna be a dread, oh my head
Someone pass the buffering, I'm sufferin'
Too many heads out here, word is born, they just frontin'!
I'm stayin' true, making sure my game's legit, no time for ass and getting caught up in that glitzy
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it
But just by having them around lets me know I won't fake it
So big up big up!
Because you emcees ain't ready
Peace to Allen Iverson, my man Stephon Marbury up in, the NBA
And I'm gonna be writin' for the magazine soon
Check me out, boom!
I'm out!

You on point Phife?
Once Again Tip
Word
Watch me bust they shit

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

[Verse 4: Phife]
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you got to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

[Hook]
You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once again Phife

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on[Instrumental][Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face!

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'?
Love and peace from Phife for '93, know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown 83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

[Interlude]
*sounds of frogs

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool[Intro: Phife and Tip]
Back at you
Right back at you

[Verse 1: Tip + Phife + both]
Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away, think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window, the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all?
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Hook: Tip and Phife]
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world

Dame un beso, s'il vous plait
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way
If we was on video, I'd press rewind
A nigga think about you all the time
Pigeon dropped a note, on top my head
RnB, pop, girls thoroughbred
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...
Pick you up
Raise your cup, let love erupt
Vol-ca-no, natural disast'
Fall in love with me? Huh, well that's that ass
Wanna get you, inside my world
Process, straight, afro or curl
Stretch me out, phase me in
Forever you and me, let me see you grin
He fucked you, I'mma tap his chin
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on "The Promo"
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man

[Outro]
Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
The madman Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia
Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin', master as in great
I'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'
While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin' around with wack rhymin'
You lose your grip from chalk climbin'
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cipher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef
Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street
Phife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Makin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath

[Chorus: Consequence]
Ay yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I'll be lettin' off gism
Writin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucka MC in my path, hey man, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit
'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, every day all day, similar to water
Crushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians
Ya new mean

I just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest
Through the years
This be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin'?
Tip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life
Featuring my man, you know what I'm sayin', Consequence
192 is the area where we represent, for the ladies and gents, haha
You know what I'm sayin'? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man
Christine, you know what I'm sayin', word life (fading out)
The Abstract Poetic, rockin' this track
Bouncin' it all over the place, up in your face
You know what I'm sayin'? My man Lightro...[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
...-Like that, It's like this
When you hear the nigga yo he be in a bliss
'Cause I make the rhymes and it's just a easy gist
With a twist, of my nouns and my verbs
Consummated, into a sentence, ease of words
That I'm at (hmm), so amazin', when I'm blazin'
Just like a trip to Portland, Trail Blazer
But yo listen, yo I gotta say it like this
I got the Phife Dawg and he wants to assist
To persist (yeah) with the rhythm (yeah)
Give 'em (yeah) what you got (yeah)
Phife Dawg hop (check it out) off the mic (check it out) and make the joint hot

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Malik Izaak Taylor is the illest rhyme creator
Let me be the first to say; that I be's a player hater
'Cause I hate when emcees play on this device known as a mic
Then have the nerve to even think that their rhymes and they're tight
So I laugh, quietly watching how the industry's bust
All these video sluts, and guys who front like they're tough
All these million-selling rappers with the bogus-like husks
Withew[? 0:48] brothers screaming "Brooklyn!", when they're probably from Lynbrook
And oh, I see hood raps putting 40's to their lips and head
Go out buy a chalice, and they wanna be a dread, oh my head
Someone pass the buffering, I'm sufferin'
Too many heads out here, word is born, they just frontin'!
I'm stayin' true, making sure my game's legit, no time for ass and getting caught up in that glitzy
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it
But just by having them around lets me know I won't fake it
So big up big up!
Because you emcees ain't ready
Peace to Allen Iverson, my man Stephon Marbury up in, the NBA
And I'm gonna be writin' for the magazine soon
Check me out, boom!
I'm out!

[Interviewer]
Hahahahahah, yes, indeed!
Yes in-[Intro]
You on point Phife?
Once Again Tip
You on point Phife?
Once Again Tip
You on point Phife?
Once Again Tip
Word
Watch me bust they shit
OK

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

[Verse 4: Phife]
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you got to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

[Hook]
You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once again Phife
Ayo that kid is niiiiiiiice

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on[Instrumental][Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face!

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'?
Love and peace from Phife for '93, know what I'm sayin'?
Tribe Called Quest, Shaheed and Tip
This is how we flip

My man Muhammad in the house, huh [come on, come on]
Zulu Nation in the house, huh [come on, come on]

After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown 83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

[Interlude]
*sounds of frogs

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool[Intro: Phife and Tip]
Back at you
Right back at you

[Verse 1: Tip + Phife + both]
Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away, think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window, the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all?
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Hook: Tip and Phife]
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?

[Verse 2: Tip + Phife + both]
Dame un beso, s'il vous plait
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way
If we was on video, I'd press rewind
A nigga think about you all the time
Pigeon dropped a note, on top my head
RnB, pop, girls thoroughbred
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...
Pick you up
Raise your cup, let love erupt
Vol-ca-no, natural disast'
Fall in love with me? Huh, well that's that ass
Wanna get you, inside my world
Process, straight, afro or curl
Stretch me out, phase me in
Forever you and me, let me see you grin
He fucked you, I'mma tap his chin
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on "The Promo"
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA

[Outro]
Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
The madman Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia
Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin', master as in great
I'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'
While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin' around with wack rhymin'
You lose your grip from chalk climbin'
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cipher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef
Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street
Phife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Makin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath

[Chorus: Consequence]
Ay yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I'll be lettin' off gism
Writin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucka MC in my path, hey man, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit
'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, every day all day, similar to water
Crushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians
Ya new mean

[Outro]
Word up
I just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest
Through the years
This be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin'?
Tip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life
Featuring my man, you know what I'm sayin', Consequence
192 is the area where we represent, for the ladies and gents, haha
You know what I'm sayin'? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man
Christine, you know what I'm sayin', word life (fading out)
The Abstract Poetic, rockin' this track
Bouncin' it all over the place, up in your face
You know what I'm sayin'? My man Lightro...[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
...-Like that, It's like this
When you hear the nigga yo he be in a bliss
'Cause I make the rhymes and it's just a easy gist
With a twist, of my nouns and my verbs
Consummated, into a sentence, ease of words
That I'm at (hmm), so amazin', when I'm blazin'
Just like a trip to Portland, Trail Blazer
But yo listen, yo I gotta say it like this
I got the Phife Dawg and he wants to assist
To persist (yeah) with the rhythm (yeah)
Give 'em (yeah) what you got (yeah)
Phife Dawg hop (check it out) off the mic (check it out) and make the joint hot

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Malik Izaak Taylor is the illest rhyme creator
Let me be the first to say; that I be's a player hater
'Cause I hate when emcees play on this device known as a mic
Then have the nerve to even think that their rhymes and they're tight
So I laugh, quietly watching how the industry's bust
All these video sluts, and guys who front like they're tough
All these million-selling rappers with the bogus-like husks
Withew[? 0:48] brothers screaming "Brooklyn!", when they're probably from Lynbrook
And oh, I see hood raps putting 40's to their lips and head
Go out buy a chalice, and they wanna be a dread, oh my head
Someone pass the buffering, I'm sufferin'
Too many heads out here, word is born, they just frontin'!
I'm stayin' true, making sure my game's legit, no time for ass and getting caught up in that glitzy
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it
But just by having them around lets me know I won't fake it
So big up big up!
Because you emcees ain't ready
Peace to Allen Iverson, my man Stephon Marbury up in, the NBA
And I'm gonna be writin' for the magazine soon
Check me out, boom!
I'm out!

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

[Verse 4: Phife]
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you got to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

[Hook]
You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife

Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once again Phife

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on[Instrumental][Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face!

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'?
Love and peace from Phife for '93, know what I'm sayin'?
Tribe Called Quest, Shaheed and Tip
This is how we flip

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown 83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

[Interlude]
*sounds of frogs

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool[Intro: Phife and Tip]
Back at you
Right back at you

[Verse 1: Tip + Phife + both]
Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away, think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window, the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all?
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Hook: Tip and Phife]
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?

[Verse 2: Tip + Phife + both]
Dame un beso, s'il vous plait
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way
If we was on video, I'd press rewind
A nigga think about you all the time
Pigeon dropped a note, on top my head
RnB, pop, girls thoroughbred
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...
Pick you up
Raise your cup, let love erupt
Vol-ca-no, natural disast'
Fall in love with me? Huh, well that's that ass
Wanna get you, inside my world
Process, straight, afro or curl
Stretch me out, phase me in
Forever you and me, let me see you grin
He fucked you, I'mma tap his chin
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on "The Promo"
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA

[Outro]
Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
The madman Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia
Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin', master as in great
I'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'
While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin' around with wack rhymin'
You lose your grip from chalk climbin'
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cipher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef
Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street
Phife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Makin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath

[Chorus: Consequence]
Ay yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I'll be lettin' off gism
Writin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucka MC in my path, hey man, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit
'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, every day all day, similar to water
Crushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians
Ya new mean

[Outro]
Word up
I just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest
Through the years
This be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin'?
Tip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life
Featuring my man, you know what I'm sayin', Consequence
192 is the area where we represent, for the ladies and gents, haha
You know what I'm sayin'? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man
Christine, you know what I'm sayin', word life (fading out)
The Abstract Poetic, rockin' this track
Bouncin' it all over the place, up in your face
You know what I'm sayin'? My man Lightro...[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
...-Like that, It's like this
When you hear the nigga yo he be in a bliss
'Cause I make the rhymes and it's just a easy gist
With a twist, of my nouns and my verbs
Consummated, into a sentence, ease of words
That I'm at (hmm), so amazin', when I'm blazin'
Just like a trip to Portland, Trail Blazer
But yo listen, yo I gotta say it like this
I got the Phife Dawg and he wants to assist
To persist (yeah) with the rhythm (yeah)
Give 'em (yeah) what you got (yeah)
Phife Dawg hop (check it out) off the mic (check it out) and make the joint hot

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Malik Izaak Taylor is the illest rhyme creator
Let me be the first to say; that I be's a player hater
'Cause I hate when emcees play on this device known as a mic
Then have the nerve to even think that their rhymes and they're tight
So I laugh, quietly watching how the industry's bust
All these video sluts, and guys who front like they're tough
All these million-selling rappers with the bogus-like husks
Withew[? 0:48] brothers screaming "Brooklyn!", when they're probably from Lynbrook
And oh, I see hood raps putting 40's to their lips and head
Go out buy a chalice, and they wanna be a dread, oh my head
Someone pass the buffering, I'm sufferin'
Too many heads out here, word is born, they just frontin'!
I'm stayin' true, making sure my game's legit, no time for ass and getting caught up in that glitzy
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it
But just by having them around lets me know I won't fake it
So big up big up!
Because you emcees ain't ready
Peace to Allen Iverson, my man Stephon Marbury up in, the NBA
And I'm gonna be writin' for the magazine soon
Check me out, boom!
I'm out!

Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

[Verse 4: Phife]
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you got to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once again Phife
Ayo that kid is niiiiiiiice

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on[Instrumental][Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face!

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'?
Love and peace from Phife for '93, know what I'm sayin'?
Tribe Called Quest, Shaheed and Tip

After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown 83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

[Interlude]
*sounds of frogs

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

Back at you
Right back at you

[Verse 1: Tip + Phife + both]
Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away, think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window, the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all?
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Hook: Tip and Phife]
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world

[Verse 2: Tip + Phife + both]
Dame un beso, s'il vous plait
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way
If we was on video, I'd press rewind
A nigga think about you all the time
Pigeon dropped a note, on top my head
RnB, pop, girls thoroughbred
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...
Pick you up
Raise your cup, let love erupt
Vol-ca-no, natural disast'
Fall in love with me? Huh, well that's that ass
Wanna get you, inside my world
Process, straight, afro or curl
Stretch me out, phase me in
Forever you and me, let me see you grin
He fucked you, I'mma tap his chin
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on "The Promo"
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man

[Outro]
Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
The madman Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia
Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin', master as in great
I'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'
While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin' around with wack rhymin'
You lose your grip from chalk climbin'
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cipher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef
Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street
Phife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Makin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath

[Chorus: Consequence]
Ay yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I'll be lettin' off gism
Writin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucka MC in my path, hey man, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit
'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, every day all day, similar to water
Crushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians
Ya new mean

[Outro]
Word up
I just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest
Through the years
This be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin'?
Tip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life
Featuring my man, you know what I'm sayin', Consequence
192 is the area where we represent, for the ladies and gents, haha
You know what I'm sayin'? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man
Christine, you know what I'm sayin', word life (fading out)
The Abstract Poetic, rockin' this track
Bouncin' it all over the place, up in your face
You know what I'm sayin'? My man Lightro...[Intro]
It's Bas, It's Bas
Super Mooking Fiends, Super Mooking Fiends

[Verse 1]
Hello, I'm back again
Money under mattresses
Flying over atlases
First-class, so to see
Turned into some mattresses
All my niggas down
When my niggas in the deficit, blowing out the pound
Cause my niggas depressed and shit
Money is the issue, Ha
Right up of the press and hit every corner
Hopping out her dress, and I barely know her
Maybe Mama didn't show her, Papa wouldn't hold her
I show her shit she's never seen, I'm the wick
Dip inside her kerosene, You ain't special, must be on that Ketamine
On my level, bitch I'm so serene, sureal
Mooking with the Fiends, oh foreal

[Chorus]
3 Rules that I follow

[Under transcription][Hook]
Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Could you be what you seem, Amazonian queen

(Verse)
Vines in the ravine
Swing down from your throne and bow down to your king
What a life we chose, nothing but hoes
The good ones, few and far between – getting hard to see 'em
Come on Eileen, could you be my visine
I’m in need of your light, could you be my high beam?
Only for a few nights, I ain’t quite what I seem
In your city couple times a year, you know what I mean
Yea, you know what I mean
Bitch, you know what I mean
Girl, you know what I mean
I don’t move keys but I got room keys
All the salty women leaving on a sour note
All the sweet ones end up chiefing on my dab of smoke
Only evening that’s in question we was laid up at the Weston
Keep some candles that be scented, until it does
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
For the loud  gotta dampen the sound yea
Gotta dampen the sound yea...[Verse]
Quarter water raised me
From a boy to a man
Like the shore to the sand, nigga I’m just tryna be free
I got a plan that you wouldn’t understand
Inmates to the man, now the BC’s
See this is Attica for the soul
Revolution, barricade all the doors
Let 'em know my soul ain’t for sale
And won’t be concealed in no type of cell
A cubical, the resistance different than a cuticle, shit is beautiful
When they try and break ya but they couldn’t graze ya
‘Cause you high up in the sky
Nigga, why you admiring the pie?
Come get you a slice 'fore these muhfuckas eat it all
But life ain’t cake, full of trials and tribulate
But we good ‘cause we beat 'em all
My maker hold my fate and I know we got a date
So I’m good if I don’t see tomorrow
I’m scrapin' up the plates, stuffin' life in my face
Just in case I never see tomorrow
Just in case I gotta see the morgue
Well in that case I hope I see Allah
And ask him why he had to take Amir
Man I really miss ya, it’s been too many years
I see you and your sisters, I see you and your kids
I see my aunt crying, man she spilled too many tears
But know this, fuck showbiz
If I make it anywhere, your kids already there
And boy you know we think about you every year
Every month, every week, every night in my sleep
I hope you come and visit like you do my pops
Man I just wanna kick it like we used to
Allah, please give a nigga blues clues
Why you take him? Why you spare me?
‘Cause I remember clearly
Sounds in my ears of them bullets flying near me

[Hook]
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
All my niggas just fly, yea fly, yea fly
Let’s go
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
Boy fly, yea fly, yea fly

This one is dedicated to
My bitch ass neighbors, ha, ha, yeah
'Cause I'm livin' better now, better now
Bitch I'm livin' better now
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I had to move 'cause my neighbors so racist (Fuck niggas)
My new crib fly though (Sheesh)
Lookin' like the 4th of July though (Fiends)
Lookin' like a frosted gelato (Dam)
Cool as a chill, Navy Seal, nigga (Pew, pew)
Hot as the heels on a field, nigga
Puttin' in work, fuck how you feel
Buy my family trips, fuck value meals
Only lie to police, I ain't tyin' your leash
I got higher motives, fuck lyin' still, I am on a whole 'nother level
Got up out the street, ran up in the industry
Just to see, that I'm dealin' with a whole 'nother devil
Whatever last, smoke buddah, make more Gouda cheese
My whip European but the kid Sudanese
Got a laundry list of niggas with the list of they needs, holy
Them cats is prone to actin' phony
Get no actions ask the homies, you ain't know?
We miles ahead, the matrimony's dead
No time for fakes, my niggas make mistakes
Heard it all, the commentary's dead
They go to state, don't get no GPAs
Got GTAs, the commissary's fed
I pray to God, I call in my request
I tell Him my regrets
I tell nobody else how it feels, I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Chorus]
I tell em my regrets
(Tell me things and old desires)
I tell nobody else how it feels
I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Verse 2]
I can tell you're apprehensive and I can't ask why
I'm like fireworks in the Baghdad sky
I might b'e the second coming, I might be the end all
But I keep her comin', especially off the Henn' dog
In the end all rivers, lakes will dry out, but us involved we gon' leave a ocean of salt, Lord
So many love's lost, let me count it with the gloves off
I need more fingers, Cole lingers long in my soul
Got my eyes down but I can't find ground
Ten toes holdin' the floor, like I'm tied down but I can't find ground
We the same, thought you came from the roots too
So love ain't love like it used to be
You abstain from the blame if you chose to
But I'ma be here some years so get used to me

[Chorus]
Tell me things and old desires
I tell nobody else how it feels
I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Verse 3]
'Cause for his new recital he go suicidal
Not me, blue recital, hit the main stage, I'm the coolest I know
How I maintain empty bottles in the silver buckets, say it's luck
Come and spend the day with us
I've been up the past 48, first 48 going great
Forty states in forty in days, got them motherfuckas goin' crazy
When all they waitin' on is me and I been waiting long to see it
Bassy

[Outro]
When you milk, you milk, you can't deny the milk
The only way to go is the milky way, my boy[Intro]
How did you know
This is what I always wanted
Could never have done many thing
Where you quick taking me? I might tumble
I’m trying, will somebody make you just shut up about it?
Can we settle down, baby?
No, let’s ride

[Verse]
I’m wired nigga on molly and Red Bull
Party with the fiends you know ain’t no party in civil
2 devils on my shoulders and I’m just caught in the middle
Got decisions to make, the decision’s been made
I swear these bitches screaming YOLO fore they sniff the yola
Feeling like a Porsche 4 door, used to feel like Corollas
My niggas still moving the yola, till they fill the quota
Popo on em like they just paroled
And fuck the help, they never showed em
So we outchea, get it by any means
I’m on fire; no lying, them boys remind me of anti-freeze
And my engine keep running, I’m supplying the energy
Ain’t a thing, you great a sin, I’m high on the canope
Looking out for my niggas, keep an eye on my enemies
Bitch, I’m just where I plan to be
So fuck what you say
This a new CBA, your favorite rapper’s been amnestied
Don’t pretend to be classy, ho
‘Cause I prefer nasty hoes
Test driving broads, ho I’m a car show
Pockets all stinch if I see them narcos
Prolly gonna pinch, nerf a nigga in the stick
The prison’s like the man, it shoulda gave us bar codes
Heart cold like it’s waiting to be transplanted
Band wagon feeling, guess I’m grant standing
Got them hoes on all 4’s, guess they can’t stand it
Shouts to oak shades, shouts to bandanna

[Hook]
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, one bottle won’t do, no
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, two bottles won’t do, no

[Bridge]
I check the homies and I breeze
And chickens hit my phone up, say they only wanna please
Some niggas actin phony ‘cause they only want a piece
I’ll be it, I see through, I never deceive you
Fiend

[Outro]
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue[Verse 1]
You never thought I'd make it this far, did you
You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star, bitch didn't you know?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
My brother Ib told me some niggas just wanna be safe
And some niggas just wanna be great
Which one are you? Let's go make history today
Let's go make history today
Boy use your brain, only your heart can lead
You'll figure your way man, this shit ain't for me to say
I come, I love until my heart can't bleed
I'm on the road, I guess it ain't meant for me to stay
But I'm here with you

[Chorus]
I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm here with you

[Verse 2]
Hey world, your favorite movie is on, it's called Attack on Niggas
The fathers that didn't pass, they all stacked in prisons
But that shit don't get a pass, no that shit don't get a grant
Might as well go fill a bag
Ridin' around, no tinted glass
Why I can't have tinted glass? Cause that cause suspicion
Cops flash like Cinemax, don't lack ammunition
Might as well go get a gap, might as well go give it back
Don't know if they'll get it right, but I know that we'll get it last
Might as well go spend a rack at a black-owned business
Had my mind on hoes, now I'm back on business, that's real
Back to what's important, I'ma build with you
Cause you're here for me and I'm here with you

[Chorus]
I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm here with you

[Outro]
You never thought I'd make it this far, did you
You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star, bitch didn't you know?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?[Verse 1: Bas]
I'm just trynna get ahead like the Grand Central ramp to the L.I.E, When a nigga headed west and the traffic is a mess
Why the police pull me over? wanna see ID & registration
Them papers don't show you my dedication
I done came up like David Blaine
Y'all niggas don't know bout levitation
It's for the takin' shots up no hesitation
No head fakes, I ain't never waitin'
Me and mines these are bonds that ain't never breakin'
Building blocks 'til the ceiling pops
Y'all killin' time that's record pacing
Dreamville shit record breakin'
Been cookin' up since my parent's basement I'm still cookin', these records blazin', you hear this shit?
I don't see you niggas I just see myself on some mirror shit
Re-decide 'fore I pull your blinds
Ain't no seeing eyes on my pyramid
Joke nigga you serious? startin' shit but I finish it like a period
And you still a bitch like a period and that's real[Verse 1]
Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down, rake the leaves
Piece of little weed
Nigga break it down, pick the seeds
Fiend, roll a swisher please
No promethazine, got amphetamines
Got me on a devil lean
Sahara to the Gobi niggas know me to be hot as water
Say, "Trust me, he flows"
Not livin' for tomorrow, got no time to borrow
Bitch, I rep my borough
Yeah, trust me Queens know
Fuck a knight in shining armor, play for team No Daughters
What this game has done taught us is "Trust me, she blows"
Stop makin' demands, bitch stay in your pocket
She eyein' my grands, bitch stay out my pocket
She eyein' my man, go ahead bitch rock it
We get it and split it, I never could knock it
I look at the bar and I bet I could top it

[Hook 2x]
Hundred racks just to drive off a lot, though
Scenic route just to dodge all the potholes
20 racks at retail, isn't it?
Cause the devil's in the details, isn't it?

[Verse 2]
Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down, rake the leaves
Here's a lil' weed
Nigga break it down, pick the seeds
Fiend, roll a swisher please
Cause the mook it give me epiphany
When hoes try to play me like tympani
Like Mighty Kong, show me finer homes
And designer stones, I want Tiffany's
Told her find a clone, I know I'm kind of stoned
No trick bitch, you can't get wit' me
Cause I found my zone
Had to put on a form, a good fit for me
I seldom see myself in dreams
I live this shit, no issues wit' my self-esteem
Tunnel vision, hear every station
Yo television, I failed to mention
Frail attention in school, dog
Failed attention, that rude boy
Fire lit by my crew boy
To acquire shit that I'm due boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fall back or pass through
Matter fact, that nigga that gassed you was ass too
Son, we gon' last like tattoos
Ho nigga get a glass shoe, why?
You can try it, but you can't high tie it
That shit weak and you can't fight fire
I've been wired for days, out in London town
I just lock shit down but I ain't got priors
Feelin' like the best, nigga ain't that biased?
Fuck, try it straight to the head but I ain't Lem Bias
From the ground up, to them telephone wires
I hold down my city since Boys on Da Block
They gave me the key, I done blown all the locks
Called a committee, Queens in this bitch
I hit all the spots, I brought all them with me
Never been petty, don't got the time to be harboring envy
I'm Fendi with mine
Gucci, bitch I got the plug, I got whatever you need, but I ain't got no love
Got something to say? I don't hear it, I can't understand
Your chatter don't make it across the Atlantic and I'm out in Europe
I'm wit' all my niggas, I never take this shit for granted
The cards have been handed, deuces is wild
Deuces is power, deuces like two hundred twenty two thou
Deuces for love, Cut it though deuces I'm out

I'm out
I'm out[Intro]
Got them speakers in my ride
I like to keep 'em bumpin'
I'm hustling, chasing dreams
In hopes that I could become something
I threw a party, she say Bassy, thank you, but it's nothin'
Cause I had to keep it jumpin'
Ya a'int  Blake Griffin, but I know that you be jumpin'
Poker face stiffin', but I know that you be bluffin'
No, I don't be cuffin', all these ducks be gettin' ends
Rubber duck etcaeterin', and I'm the pain
I left to make, and can't be ya crutch and meta...

[Verse 1]
Piffy lined up, fired up in the dutch
Or the EZ Widers, slide up, six speed
Like clutch, the city on me, I'm clutch
No Worries they depending on me, I'm clutch
Toast up mimosas at thirty thousand feet
Henny in hand, land, can make it out my seat
Michelin man, making grip up out the street
Grab The D cup on the freak, played that bitch and press repeat
J-Walkin' thru time zones, I'm on that trip
Got yo piece of the pie, and you pawn that shit
I'm takin' all that shit until I own that sis
College shit get mind blown, I'm on that quick
She got expensive addiction and a nose that's rich
Nothin' betta than brown dough that's on that stick
A lil' hashish, shiish, baby
If you roll it up with some keif, Super Mook
Super Mook chasin paper 'bout my loose leaf
Rollin papers yeah I do chief
Meditatin' like I'm Bruce Lee, at the Carter like I'm Tunechi
Riddin' thru the borough while this cutie feed me sushi
Salmon, avocado and an order of the cuchie
Charles De Gaulle to JFK
Brods givin up the draws like I'm JFK
Guess I'm flawed, after all, ain't nobody perfect
Do it all just to ball and the shit is worth it
Fiend

[Bridge]
It's like that now
Quick, fuck that let me get back

[Verse 2]
I'm in L.A. but my Jays got sand from Dubai
I'm getting brains all day like I'm Magna Cum Laude
Cause, while you boys planked I was getting more stamps
Now my passport shitting on your whole camp
Fuck ya Instagram, that monkeys do delivery, that instant gram
Damn, put them ones up for them ones that's above us cause we miss them man
And to the niggas stuck up in the can
And slam a cage up in ya body put cha body up in a different plan
Different plain
Same hustle different game
They don't love you if they always wanted you to stay the same
Slidin' through the 'jects, now I'm slidin' through the W with different dames
That's a W nigga figure that shit is game
I just keep doubling figures until my niggas ain't
Pedelin' pills and kaine
Cause in the streets, or the industry man them presidents still the same

[Outro]
Them presidents still the same
I get that green back
I see stacks and relapse
Fiend Bas, I mean that
I need that[Intro]
Just another story in the game
But every story ain't the same
But if you change can you change back
It's a shame that I came back

[Verse 1]
But my niggas wouldn't let me hold no weight
They said Bas you gonna make it get us out this fuckin' place
Anywhere we wanna take it Tokyo, Makow
Make hoes make french toast, and bow
Dinner at Del Frisco's
Houses in every zip code
I'm headin' out to Cali nigga you should see my rent though
I'm fuckin' with the vibes this shit a different tempo
I never need a mink coat we makin' strides
But I swear this shit is never simple
I'm trying to keep my lady
She never had a baby
I know she got the kid though
I sent more and pondered how to do that
Cause I ain't too good at love but I know how to do raps
Write it like MJ playing the 23
Wiser my age I've been graying since 23
Everyday it's like 20 beats I feast
Cause everything on my plate the fiends they just relate
We ain't even there but bitch look what we made
New York, New York, my city that is my state
My niggas going to court for ballin' love of the sport
Supply and demand, let's call it love of the snort
Let's call it love of the snort and all of the sort
It push me harder and farther
My father pushin' 70 don't want him dying a martyr for me
For his guidance I'll be grinding till he's off of his feet
I pray it all come from me
This shit is all for the fam the rest is all for the team, fiends
Never once slide type clique
Never untie hit the ground like a bus ride
Shake the town like a mudslide

[Hook]
City of the Empire
City of the Empire
City of the Empire

[Outro]
Queens shit, fiend shit
Queen bitch roll blunts seamstress
G shit, allegiance
To my real bitches and my real G's salute thee
It's Bas[Intro]
Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the rider
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
Everything glowing ain't a diamond
I know everything glowing ain't a diamond
Girl you shining

[Hook]
But I ain't felt love in a long time, and I  told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

[Verse 1]
Killing these niggas, I got a feeling these niggas is out to get me but trust me I got 'em
Straight out the borough my city love me we thorough
My nigga you don't want none of them problems
She acting crazy she calling me baby I just be feeding them bitches the bottles
She live in way up in Harlem but she come to me when I call her
And she all about her fashion she be working for Vogue
Me I'm all about my stacking I be working the road

[Bridge]
But them clouds never get old
Them clouds never get old

[Verse 2]
So focused on, make the dopest song
Got this chick open armed, got her lit on patron
Got her ticked off, cause I got no tick for her
I got no time, but I got some dick for her now
She was lit, I was milk
Girl don't let that milk spoil
You got some friends that stress you
He ain't loyal, I got some friends, don't let 'em think for you now
Pull up the whip for you now, here go the town
I am no pimp, but I am a player
You not with the shits? I'll talk to you later
I'm playing girl I got a thing for you now

[Hook]
But I ain't felt love in a long time, and I told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

[Bridge]
718 to your state, 212 to your city
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
718 to your state, 212 to your city

[Verse 3]
Throwing fishing nets in the ocean to cash
Good catch, here's to hoping it last, nigga
And bring them hoes back to the pad from the show
But only if they know how to act, nigga
Don't ever get stuck on your laurels like
All of them stuck in the past niggas
Shit, it's how I got past niggas
For real

[Outro]
Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the rider
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna[Verse 1: Bas]
They putting prices on heads, silver or lead
I pray the scores settle 'fore the devil notice you dead
Got me smoking the potent, my eyes open and Otis, they red
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said
That aunty sippin on, we missin ya
Even tho you gone, your thought alone can lift us up
This is us
Got some niggas never call me 'less they need something
But I pick up, like, "whassup, what you need cousin?"
My niggas know that I love 'em
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow
Used to borrow your digital scale
Flippin' them sales
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger
The swishers and dutch fill up
Bitches in lust with us
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing
Had a talk and she remark: "you so engaging"
Running game, it's all the same
I'm growing jaded
Had a couple things in common, like Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too faded for conversatin'
I'm sittin' here contemplatin' how to win

[Chorus: J Cole]
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Yeah
Cousin in jail again, asking me for bail again
Close when I was 12, but I was much frailer then
He was like 16, a nigga from the gutter and
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now you buggin'
Cause you looking at the cover and you say "Yo that's my cousin"
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden
And I'm showing love saying "yo look what I did
Man, nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big"
But now you saying "Man enough about you
Shit what about me, my nigga what about me?
Oh you forgot about me?"
Same niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cuz got yo back
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up
See you headed to the top you need to let me catch up
Please let me catch up
Won't you let me catch up man"
"I'll see you when I see you
Harsh as it seems to say, I wouldn't want to be you
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you"

[Chorus: J Cole]
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey[Interlude]
When they see you are inferior do not believe a word they say. Fiends. Resist. When they say they need billions of dollars to build bonds instead of schools open your eyes. Fiends. Resist. When they say they want to reserve our way of life so they must take life, this is a lie. Resist. Super Mook. Speak truth of power, do not comply.

[Verse 1]
Listen up, I'm gone like ET
No prone alloy, all white GT
Waking up early morning not easy
Bas is a fiend, snort 'til at least 3
Coming up, watch me peak
White home with a loan, this not DC, but I be the president
Run the confederate of the generous
Well, bitches never sell a bit
Trying to get in my city better sell a bit
Sell a bit, sell 'Piff, nigga sell a brick
Sell tricks up, make your stretch boy
New Jigster, that's my next toy
Going like Wall Street after exploits
Off that, bomb weed that I explore
Calmly, board the next plane at the airport
Where I'm going? Who knows
Anywhere it ain't snowing with two hoes
Penthouse, condo with two floors
Dipping through minor coke and two doors
New ports, shit, they ain't hotter than me
Kick up my feet like an [?] G'
Wake up, my bed makes itself
Bake up, inhale, take deep breath

[Interlude 2]
Do not believe. Do not accept. Do not be afraid. Do not surrender. Do not judge. Super Mook. Do not [?] against my neighbor.

[Verse 2]
So high I can never find a fucking thing
But I always find my fucking bling
Where was I?
Riding on the rings
Saturn, swagger, got me all rapping out of pattern
Smoking good, give your bitch wood like a tavern
If they could, bet them niggas would
Doesn't matter, cause they can't serve them hoes
They ain't on a platter, took my bank
Eminem, nigga Marshall Mathers
That's a couple milli' hoe, stuntin' like a video
Burning on the piccolo, green
New York City Fiend
City colder than the ghoster
EDM mean
Streets like a cobra, until you get bitten you probably wouldn't even know what I mean
They ask, but they never know what I seen
So busy trying to scheme a nigga forgot to dream
I'm dreamin' lucid
Chess not checkers ya'll niggas stupid
Bet's not check cause ya'll niggas foolish
Bas serve 'em hot ya'll at the [?]
Damn, revenge is a dish best served cold
So, I wish that to them assholes
Yeah, wave goodbye to my last goals
Set sight on the flag poles
Bas[Chorus]
In a vault that I hold you in
Open and close
Safe as thoughts that I hold you in
Open and close
Open and close
Open and

[Hook]
Fly to Japan, saw panda like Desiigner
Fly out to London, the drugs was like designer
Fly out to France, bought some pants that was designer
Did that by design, I did that by designin'

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm a star, dodgin' bitches like they be comets
Or they be comics, or read comics
Way too often ain't no hero, let me be honest
Get a cake made, can never overstate
I'm dedicated to my pay-grade, I'm heavy goin' eighth
They play it safe it so they never be afraid
But my fears make me great, make me feel alive, levitate
Let you bear the weight of how I feel inside
Let the pain go, I choose to move freely (freely)
Let my wings grow, I'm movin' too freely (too freely)
See, this game, it'll ruin dudes easy
Platinum chain, but the ego bruise easy

[Hook]
So I fly to Japan, seen a panda like Desiigner
Fly out to London, the drugs was like designer
Fly out to France, bought some pants that was designer
Did that by design, I did that by designin'

[Chorus]
In a vault that I hold you in
Open and close
Safe as thoughts that I hold you in
Open and close
Open and close
Open and

Be faithful, it's harder to stay it
I don't know how else to say it
The wonders of all the mosaics
I don't know how I could stay put

[Verse 2]
Slim chance, I gotta straight crook
Like I trace edges, let my pace tell it
I shine like the cave dwellers on their first day smellin' pine
Happy Earth Day, you heard, the world is mine
And don't it show? And nigga hate to brag but it show
I been out collectin' bags 'cause the tape a classic
Told myself I would make it happen

[Hook]
Fly to Japan, seen a panda like Desiigner
Fly out to London, the drugs was like designer
Fly out to France, bought some pants that was designer

[Verse]
Okay, I got this chick enthralled, slippin' out her draws
Stick it in her jaw first then I'm in her snatch like I'm dippin' with this broad, purse never comin' back
Cuttin' like a barber stupid niggas spoiled her
But I'm a G see? Luke I am your father
Vader how I son these niggas, cater how I serve these niggas
Big beard, Al-Qaeda with the fuckin' clippers
Six gears y'all chasin' when we fuckin' dip in
Pop my clip and shoot my shot
Got her butt naked in my fuckin' kitchen, alfredo what she cookin'
Light a blunt when we want a killin' of the good shit
Niggas front, I got a couple hittas up in Brooklyn
So they can go to hell they haters
Catch me a fine honey, bag two bitches in the elevator
We'll celebrate her penetrate her, shit cold
Top floor, you ain't got the code for the elevator
Shine like a laminator so the hoes wanna stronghold
Hit 'em with the Arnold, part one, two, three I'm a terminator
Salvation week and honestly man, the last couple weeks
Light the gas on the beat, like a pass from the heat
James, Wade, Bas I'm a G, no stage name
Ties on the street we bang, bang
Eyes on the prize so my mind run in circles
Try and go for mine, and I'll fuckin' hurt you
Moms was a dime? then I probably birthed you
Gave you a style boy now it's time for curfew
Sleep tight, see the light of day
Sticky finger face time, Onyx with technology
School I used to waste time, but I know biology
And I know my chemistry, bet I know my math
I will solve the task, pushin' somethin' foreign with 200 on the dash
When they call ignore 'em if it ain't about the cash
Shorty got it goin', she amazin' with the ass
Bas lap these rappers like I'm tapin' down the gas
Pedal to the metal, New York City prince, rose pedals for the fellow
This is hella instrumental, shit, I had to go and get a rental

But oooh I've been waiting for you
Ooooh I've been waiting for you

And I was like Looord
And she was like "boooy you better be smart with your ways"
I turn to Mike Shaw
And he was like dawg  "I think she got the Donk Of The Day"
Cause girl you got the Donk Of The Day
That gotta be the donk of the day
You know you got the donk of the  day
That gotta be it

[Verse 1: Bas]
Never had a day worth planning
Cause every damn day is outlandish
I holla'd at Wave Bandana
My nigga is so high outlandish
I said we can hit the hood spot
My niggas do spray they canvas
Or we can hit the good spot
But Imma have to change appearance
I went to buy a cardigan
I seen you at the mall and then
I could re-call again, I was on youuu and
My nigga was on your friend
They been steady two years now
But I never called again
And you ain't never fall off
So can I get on again
Breeze through the city baby
You would think I'm on to win
I think I was born to spend
I heard you was dancing girl
I think you were born to bend
I think I was born, born again when I found that pen mothafuckin' right

[Chorus: Bas]
Every day, everyday, everyday, everyday
I been chasing the truth
But oooh I've been waiting for you
Ooooh I've been waiting for you

And I was like Looord
And she was like "boooy you better be smart with your ways"
I turn to Mike Shaw
And he was like dawg  "I think she got the Donk Of The Day"
Cause girl you got the Donk Of The Day
That gotta be the donk of the day
You know you got the donk of the  day

[Verse 2: Bas]
Never had a day worth planning
Cause every damn day is outlandish
I'm going over sees outlandish
A nigga so high outlandish
Man I'm like a fly on the wall
And these four walls heard it all
I could hit a feline in your voice
But them words won't hurt at all
Cause these broads gone leave til the morning
Champagne form bubbles in my bong
All I need is the love of my crew
Fuck you, my borough know I'm on
Never been to work with a briefcase
But I'm still in each state
So my Momma text, and said, "be safe"
Saw one from my ex it said "be great"
First thought like she fake
Text back like "preciate"
Girl be brave
What you want hundred replays
This shit is dead like Enyce
Dear Nefertiti
I'm sure your'e a Goddess or
My shades are 3D
Cause damn they look large, them titties

[Verse 3: Bas]
She always on them up is when they go down
All she know is turn up girl slow down
Slow down, girl slow down
Body type Mya, face more Aaliyah
Stacked, used to run track
Til she tore her knee up
Me I'm from Queens
And we up, my last shit crack
Bitch I'm back with the re-up
Already caught the vibes
But I don't got the time
Girl I'm saying you should know
She said, "bottom line I be lying if I said I was surprised when you said you had to go
Met her out in France and her ass meaner
In them Euro hotels with the Ass Cleaners
Long ways from them days when we had peanuts
Looked back we just laugh like damn we up
She said let's go
Back to the bathroom to do some blow, Woah
Said you was sprinting, you really shouldn't do that blow no more
Said I do what I do, it ain't enough for a vote
What's it to you, you don't know how I cope
Shit I done seen it's like ether to me
You don't know how I roll so you speechless to me
You niggas, Niggas don't get it you got it so good
I'm developing penis envy, Pause
No Venus in me, give a fuck if you niggas from Mars
You need to chill
I see the Coke in your jaw
You getting  too aggy
You still got about half a gram in that baggy
I'm gone take care of this tab
And I'll probably just hail you a cabby

[Chorus]
Every day, everyday, everyday, everyday
I been chasing the truth
But oooh I've been waiting for you
Ooooh I've been waiting for you[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
This a true flame, this ain't butane
Who changed when you called? Who came?
Still do, never falter
You know I rock with you like Gibraltar
Ain't no pressure, how 'bout me and you make a movie in memories
Remember, now that's forever
Gotta love the way we put it all together
Lord knows I love the way He put you all together
You are stellar, and I'm a champion
Clique full of real niggas, living way up in the hills, nigga
My next door neighbor's a Hilfiger
Big gate cops can't come thru
Got chicks down for the one-two
Got one thing, she the one to
Lord, how many of my dreams gon' come true?

[Pre-Chorus]
With you I could be patient
Limousine, that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need, put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl, we go deeper

[Chorus]
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for a nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for a nigga, don't

[Verse 2]
Don't front, when you see me in the city and your friends, they  talk about me
Talking down about me, how they say I ain't committed
What the fuck they know about me?
Told you everything there is to know about me, still you doubt me
I got niggas in the state and the county and the city
All my niggas that escaped, 100k to Sallie May, let me get the record straight
We gon' see some better days, facts
Bassy Bas the Basquiat of rap then basket my pain and left on my needs
Peel on these scars, appealing to bars
It's something I need to function, not me
It's nothing I need, nothing like you, so that's what I need
Looking for you, and you and I need it, got justice side
You to my dreams, you were my angel, viewing my demons
You are now in all of my sins, I pray you're undo
All that I been, I pray it come through, I pray it come too
I pray it come true

[Bridge]
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for your nigga, don't

[Pre-Chorus]
With you I could be patient
Limousine, that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need, put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl, we go deeper

[Chorus]
Don't front for a nigga

[Bridge: Bas]
A moment of silence with words that he heard on the phone
Strapped up just like a Platoon, won't find no Oliver Stone
He had four brothers when he was 16 and my nigga now all of them gone
I break a pound of that loud, I smoke it all on my own

[Verse 1: Cozz]
Look, I'm at work like fuck it man
I might flip and tell my manager to suck it man
Whats two hundred dollars a week
I got a bunch of fam
Got aunties, got my brother, my sister, my father, my mother
Plus I got Uncle Sam
And this mop ain't the only thing right in this bucket man
But back to mopping like fuck it man
Know I got a lot things coming man
I know a lot of niggas doubt but they don't understand that
Ain't no limits to what God can prove
They told me this life wasn't logical and I showed my niggas it was possible
Like fuck an obstacle cause this wasn't even in the plan
And now I notice what I got to do
And I'm not just going to shine I'ma blind you too

Got a whole tank of dopamine, flush it

You're never as low as you think, nah, nah, man your never as low as you think

[Verse 2: Bas]
Shit, cause I ain't rich enough
I mean my father got a whip but ain't sick enough
My mother need treatment like she ain't been sick enough?
My cousin need treatment like she ain't been sick enough?
My God I mean before I die give me everything required to die knowing I did enough
And my niggas well, they can never drink enough
Let me get a couple bottles get 'em liquored up
Young kings in the city so we feast like the royals, sleepless
The city the only teacher, the snakes in retreat
Don't retreat thats a coil
Stray from police they will seek and destroy you
Nigga no pirates, homie I got lockships
I go Loch Ness on these fuck niggas, can't fuck with us
They all boxed in, might circle round and dump shots in
See Cole, he might pop in and go beast mode
The new East Coasts, them Queens niggas to them Ville niggas gone speak for it
Niggas know it, I feel at home in like every city
Rock big body like 750
My bitch body like Heaven pick me
I'm winning nigga, I'm winning nigga, I'm

Keep you close to my heart
Save up the moment,  a moment

[Verse 1]
Since my niggas facin probation we gon smoke they faces off
Wish that we can smoke and smoke until we burn them cases off
I’m not too proud about, not much to smile about
It’s like they never took them fuckin braces off
Gunshots
 but ain’t no fuckin races start
Either play your part and play it apart or play it raw, hole in 1
Few hunned yards, you a superstar groupies heart
But yo lady got the truest heart
I’m on the verge of greatness, patience is the only virtue
But for the moment I’ll be
 overindulging, I see
Gracious faces, greener passes, gold chains, purple fumes
Couple niggas still breathing but to me R.I.P
I give niggas a shovel, tell em “get to digging, you ain’t finished?
Til that hole is big enough for you to fit in”
I don’t need credit, I don’t need a fuckin credit limit
Me and my team travel like we never learn to pivot
And spend it in cities where bitches numbers be like 21 digits
How I’m supposed to dial that when I’m high as that, hah?
How was such a chilly breeze flowin from yo eye and flash
I thought fire breed new life but niggas is dying
 fast

[Hook: Bas]
I’m on a pill, think I love this bitch – that’s how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin, that’s the cleanest bill
Poisons infiltrate my regiment and even still
I ain’t numb and under this I could feel it still

On these tracks, miles ahead, you twice lap
Ego bruised, you come through

It's just me, you, Jack and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her pour me a glass
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
And if it's mine that's you honey
Stick together like new money
Hit Dubai on that dune buggy
Catch some rays like it's Tampa Bay
And I know what drives you crazy
On how I switch daily
From love is so amazing
To love is so enslaving
Yet all you have is patience
Fight for us as if life is love
If love is gone it's dead life in us
I repent all my sins
Always trynna put knife in us
I hear my devil's enticing but
They run amok every night
They love to fuck (Whoop!)
They ain't nothin' but some pressure cause
Pressure bust (Pipes)
Promise for the two of us, I never rush
It's just me, you, Jack, and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her, pour me a glass
I'm in my zone

And she was like Lauryn Hill tell him
I was trynna be a player still on my Bill Bellamy
But she couldn't understand
Cause everytime we go out we go out with a bang
She just want a taste
Fill up with regrets now you get em by the text
Bitch you never wear the smiley face OK
You can tell me bout it or you can tell it to the ace
Cause we never let it go to waste
Don't you ever let me go to waste
Black star so we couldn't burn out
Like black cards we ain't gettin' turned down
My God gon' get the word out
That's laughter my bitch got ass like NASA
That line prolly only makes sense to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me

Call me when you need, only when you- ooh

I'm going OT for the week
Double OT for the weekend
Got me a freak and she geeking
She talk a lot when she peaking
Speaking 'bout life, drama and her current affairs, let‘s bury it there
I got enough problems, got no worries or care, spare you an ear
And she think that's me on the internet
She don't know me that's the internet
She just get high off my intellect
I just get high tell her "give me neck"
My mind on this check (you know what I'm saying)
My mind on this check (just know I ain't playing)
My mind on this check (this money of mine)
My mind on this check (that's all on my mind)

General guidelines to ride by
Can't kill my vibe, you couldn't find mine
Come to New York City, I'm in the skyline with a fine dime
And nigga we ain't fine dining
Hit the Halal stand for cheap plates
Hit the high line, that's a cheap date
I ain't worthy, fuck it who is?
Do what you do girl, fuck it you lit
Hundred niggas yelling "New York back"
I hear em rapping they only set, "New York back"
I'm in Queens to Harlem, the Garden I rap
And I'm only hearing New York clap
Bout to move out to Cali, got a little thing out the valley
And this one girl at hollywood hookah
I wish I knew to show her how to maneuver
Truth, through the city like a presidential motorcade
On my way so the motherfuckers don't shake
Never mind I'm just smoking that grade A
Running with the same niggas since grade eight
You ain't never seen no strange ones appear
My niggas been the same ones for years
I don't do it for the peers, I do it for the fam
Man, all of my angles are clear
Other day yo, I was shopping on Rodeo
Got a call from my nigga Cheyo
Said the hood hot bro
Gotta get away yo
Losing niggas like every day
Told 'em 18 months I'ma get a tour bus
Coming up and we never looking back
Need a rut to the cuts that bleeds deep
Three ducks in the truck like beep beep

[Bridge]
Life is what you make of it, it's play-doh
This year, this year man goes back to the moon

[Verse 2]
If you coming to my city wanna know the deets?
I'm the embassy, I'm the one to see
Yeah baby, yeah baby
From over here but I took it over there baby
Riding in the drop, let your hair crazy
Climbing to the top going stair crazy
Crazy how the game opened up
A nigga ain't been home for some months
But when I get home I be posted up
Do it for the city til the coast is us
From a city where a nigga turn a penny to a twenty
But when the penny turns friends turn to enemies
As semis turn urns into memories
Make shots nigga burn like the Hennessy
The city got problems, the city's so godless
I watch it all burn like it's heresy
Witchcraft for your bitchass, which craft is you gift at?
I live in the moment, the moment is timeless
I hear all your talk but you're so unaccomplished
Opinions are nonsense
And I ain't got time for opinions to process
These days I'm inspired by me and nothing else
Bottles of tequila and some weed and nothing else
You know my niggas with me and no one else
I ain't pressing you can hold them hoes, sudden death
Got golden goalsYou gotta do what your heart tells you to do. Let me tell you something' right now. You're only allowed three great women in your lifetime. They come along like the great fighters, once every ten years. Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Louis. Sometimes you get 'em all at once. Me? I had my three when I was 16. That happens. What are you gonna do? That's the way it goes, you know? Tell you right now. See this girl? Maybe this girl, she put wind in your sails. Maybe she's your first great one[Verse]
Fuck you Quick, Quick!
Get it regardless
Fucking the game, I hit it the hardest
It won't be the same I give you my word
I never do promises unless I deliver
Life's a bitch but ain't no living unless I forgive her
That's bottles after bottles all this stress on my liver
I don't ever watch the news
They don't ever do no articles about the stress on my niggas
We the best in the business, I'm their Captain-Lieutenant
Cole he caught a jet and rolled
He just point ahead to roll, niggas slept for a minute
Now its over for these hoes claimed the city for my own
Listen when the story told they gone tear, they gone cheer
They gone say the homies home yeah Queens, they gone say the burrows on
Bas

[Outro]
Shit
I'm happy as fuck nigga!
This my last winter
Two Week Notice
Fuck it, I'm not one with speeches nigga
That's itPart I: Highs

[Verse 1]
Strange highs, no day jobs, new address
Old vice, new temptress
Settle down one day this is practice
Where every coach is a model or an actress
Fiend
I just wanna meet some lawyer bitches
Fuck that, I just wanna meet some loyal bitches
So like Christmas Eve I just toy with bitches
Got hoes on beans like they Goya bitches
I, Minnesota bitches
Destroy the bridges
But you won't see my shoes wet
What you sayin ain't paid my due yet?
Well, fuck boi I be on the road still puttin work in the Duet
Fuck nigga, can you hear it? Me and your bitch gon sing a duet ( La- La- La- La)
No hero to them hoagies
Cause hoes get loose like bogies
If my nigga ask for it he could have her, I could only have two left
Broads all look from afar see the same view
Could accept who you are till they change you
Can't lose what you ain't choose
As far as I see it

[Hook]
Ironic, I was just lookin for a lighter but I found you now lets go
And fuck the night up ( the night up, the night up)
Lets go and fuck the night up ( the night up, the night up)
Lets go and fuck the night up
Ironic, I was just lookin for a lighter but I found you now lets go
And fuck the night up ( the night up, the night up)
Lets go and fuck the night up ( the night up, the night up)
Lets go and fuck the night up

Part II: "Illegal In America" (Excerpt)

[Interlude]
What we about to get into?
Stuff that's illegal in America, but legal here
A bunch of weed smoking and bitches
Bitches!
Embarrassing the family name[Intro]
We ain't buyin' none of that
None of that

[Hook]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce

[Bridge]
Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit
Pissed off my scholarship quick
Now I'm back in the town
I'm back in the town

[Verse 1]
A nigga been searching for purpose, there's nothin' around
Back in there makin' my old moves, wrong move
Play the game and nigga no rules, poor you
You could probably lose your soul too, dancing with the devil
The seeds were planted back in '02
I guess I learned my lesson
Cause now a nigga at the O2, London on tilt
With the G's, ballin' like we watch film
If you talking Queens, nigga please
Them niggas reaching, we sould put em on stilts
I know we cool and all but cool it y'all, they pullin' off him
My nigga who are y'all? Don't get my crew involved

[Hook]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off

Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only

And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
(You niggas just talking the most like housewives)

[Verse 2]
Millions soldiers get a re-deployment
Cause ain't no leader here that we appointed
We the only ones that matter now
Cut the chatter down
Fuck your style, this ain't dappered down
Wear my own shit, still hittin' bitches like it's batter round
Call me spring training
I've been whiling but I'm maintaining
Young burrow Bassy
Dawg, whole borough watch me
Fiends, boys from the block
But we got hoes in the lobby
A tree grows from the concrete
Like he rose to the top
Cocky, them boys finna flop
But not me, your boy been alive

Pockets is full of the hope from the quotes I never wrote
Tell em' me and my bro Doe Burger came for the dope only
Benjamin Franklin them folks owe me
Bassy told you my nigga, I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit, but ain't pay off all my tuition
Now I'm back in the town from rapping for crowds
A nigga been searching for purpose
And guess what I found?

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Pastor Black Lip join my diocese
Warn the people sleeping on the legion
I'm a Dreamvillain talking major keys
Think DJ Khaled playing Mavis Beacon
Soulo found the loud and lit it back woods
Back to back, it's like I'm mad at Meek
Burning brain cells with my nigga that just made bail like last week
Still ducking strays in the plies like submissive bitches
With my dogs at the top and we in heat, fuck all ya'll 'til I'm in the box
Six feet underneath the gravel, casket made of 47 karat gold
Hear the trumpets blow, Jesus banging the gavel
Soul

[Hook 2: Bas]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives

[Verse 2: Bas]
Soulo hold up let me get it back
Had to run the borough, bring the city back
Got the power in my head, yeah, yeah
Been a year since I fit in fitted caps
Go and tell them niggas that Bas brought the East back, eat that
Niggas play my album and repeat that
Niggas play your album, hear them weak raps
And delete that, that's soft shit
Need some wheatgrass
Better boss up, awh fuck
Got your bitch starstruck, all fuss
Got five figures in my offers
My how the times have changed
I might leave tour and go buy the Range
I see the snakes, I see the fakes
I see 'em straight through designer frames
I just got crib out in L.A
I get my pick at the thots, but she can not stay
If she had her way she'd be picking the locks
Got a shower big enough to dance in
With your favorite singer and the dancers
In the party, in the back booming
Rep the city like I'm Pat Ewing
Fiends high as bald eagles
And my product all legal
Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit

[Hook 3: Bas]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Like I do my Saint Laurents
She can't wait to take 'em off
Complimenting my expensive jeans
Turn your housewife to a thot-ty
Thought a bitch cadance made a thizz face
All these niggas do is copy, wait what?
We ain't buying none of that shit, that shit
For the birds and the fact is, you just a gnat to a pterodactyl
However unbalanced that is, this ain't about status
We cease and desisting y'all, the teachers dismissing ya'll
Insisting you give it up
Cole World, codeine in my cup
Fiends

[Hook 4: Bas]
Look at 'em sippin' the sauce

Watch me ride the beat like Hidalgo

Cause ima need some proof money, Louis with the bands inside[Intro]
Fuck, what time is it? C'mon, man

[Verse 1]
Look girl, I see the sun is comin' up
What the fuck is up? Girl you trynna cut a rug or what?
If you trynna front, bitch I ain't the one, I ain't the one
Don't be trynna stunt, got some bud and one vanilla dutch
Roll another blunt, mooked
Got you slow-mo so, even if we rush by the time I cut
It'll be feelin' like a couple months, but it's only what?
10 minutes in this rented truck
Girl I only want 10 minutes in this rented truck
Got them windows foggin', hazy baby
Wildin' I'm an 80's baby
Super mookin' fiend we found nirvana like that naked baby
Danica, Patrick, way she strip this chick is racy
There they go, her top, her bra, draw, I'm reachin' for her daisys, daisys, daisys, I'm reachin' for her daisys, then I screech in that mercedes I be ghost like Patrick Swayze, Swayze, Swayze
Girl yo ass is crazy if you think I'm wifin' you

[Hook]
I ain't the one for you, I ain't the one for you
I ain't the one, nope, yeah

[Outro]
And we everywhere, fiend flight, club fiend, [?] roll the grass up and he light it like a light bulb
And we everywhere, fiend flight, club fiend, [?] roll the grass up and he light it like a light bulb
Like a light bulb
Like a light bulb[Intro: The Hics]
Since I've let go of you and I
Lately I've been feeling too alive
Flying too close to the sun, yeah
Flying too close to the sun, yeah

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Oh yeah
Trees that grew between us
Tears that drip between us
Years have blew between us just to throw away
Might've lost our glory, but I love our story
Yeah I lock the door just to store it away

[Bridge: The Hics]
They say love don't cost a thing
Yeah right that's a underbid
They say love don't cost a thing
Oh yeah right that's a underbid
That's a underbid
That's a underbid
They say love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1: Bas]
And you know they be lying like Kellyanne Conway
I just get my thoughts off, I just take the top off
When the cauldron bubble, we come from the back block
So they call us trouble, we can never slouch nor stop off
Weekend on the couch with the socks off
Nah, we can make it count, run the clock off
We can count lives on the block lost
Cautionary tape, that we can never block off
All I see is hate, how many memories can a million make?
Opinionated, young nigga seen the whole world with my own two
What they gon' do with this young nigga?
Whole squad workin' on the same page like we one nigga
Like we one
I can't get jiggy with you clowns
I'm busy I've been giving New York City a whole new sound
Who really gon' hold this down? Who? Me, funny
I catch niggas gettin' sore when I do me
I still wish them niggas more than they do me
Gotta live up to the blessings of my Umi
Bring myself, couple steps closer to my God above
Never read the "Art of War" but it's hard to love
Never know when you go rollercoaster
All your highs got a low, rollercoaster
Bring myself, couple steps closer to my God above
Never read the "Art of War" but I could write the Art of Love

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Oh yeah
Trees that grew between us
Tears that drip between us
Years have blew between us just throw away
Might've lost our glory, but I love our story
Yeah I lock the door just to store it away

[Verse 2: Bas]
The inner me is tellin' me, "I gotta pace it"
The winner in me is tellin', "I got a bottle of Ace"
Cole gave me at the Garden from the case Hov sent him
Looked him in the face
Told 'em I can't pop it til sell it on my own occassion, bold claim
Told my momma I'd be back and I make it, both came true
Thought I was escapin', just to find myself right back in the Matrix, both pills blue
I thought I'd be fulfilled
I came from not a dollar in my momma basement
I came from baggin' product in my momma basement
Almost caught some shells tryna bust a couple sales
They went and caught a collar in my momma basement
I've been tryna keep her proud since, nigga way back
Got some niggas, keep me grounded, that's some way back
But I gotta take flights sometimes
These are fightin' times, I'm my only opponent
Somedays I'm betrayin' my holiest moments
I don't know who could control 'em
I don't know who could control 'em
I ain't living for me, I'm the youngest of five
And if I don't survive, I don't know who could console 'em
I don't know who could console 'em

[Outro: Bas]
Since I've let go of you and I
Lately I've been feeling too alive[Dialogue: Gloria Clemente & Billy Hoyle]
"How much do you love me?"
"I love you infinity."
"That's not enough."
"Infinity is the biggest number there is."
"No it's not."
"You tell me one bigger."
"Infinity plus two."
"Ha, I love you infinity plus two."
"Oh Billy you so stupid! You should've said I love you infinity plus infinity!"[Intro]
Girl get your head right, you best get your head right
You make sure my home good, I make sure your neck bright
You text me you wanna be next to me

All my niggas high as hell and blunted
Bought my bitch the YSL she wanted
Nigga, Mom Dukes wanna trip to Dubai
I'ma get her everything she wanted
I'ma do this shit the way I wanna
Cube hard to them California days
Remember hoes I had to motivate, now they see Sun, like the water breakin'
They get to count my dough but you got your own, you the star of the show
We do it big, goin' hard on the road, but you got my heart on a rope
You invaded my conscience, I'm a dog, but not much of a bark
You smart, you takin' precautions, shit, I knew from the start

[Hook: Correy C]
This for all time, you can't blame the summer, girl
Get your head right
This for all the time, you can't blame the summer, girl
Get your head right
Oh, girl, you gotta get your head right (girl)
Oh, girl, you gotta get your head right[Hook]
Faded on the Henny Imma need the Champagne
Mayor of my city I don't even campaign
We never say sorry, fuck the authorities
I get stamps from customs, you get them from the club man, check your priorities

[Verse 1: Bas]
See DB hate his job, but DB half way to a DB9
I think he'll be fine
And Doubi out in Cannes every summer time hit me like "Bas, gotta come on time"
And Ash out in Dubai, and Gwelly my Nigga
I ain't seen him in a minute so he probably got a new ride
And Gunna One Hunna, and Reg gettin' fed
My Nigga 500 and my Niggas have a Q Ride
Reminiscing on the Q Ride
I'm talking about the bus
They talk about the city now they talk about us
Nas nigga, 50, I need money like Puff
Man, I be on my grind til I'm on the Mount Rush and
Ced just got bread, cop a ounce puff
Don't care Nigga next year, charge it to the budget
Fuck it, Last Winter
You got a fatty honey, I could build a tent on it
Bring ya girls too, whole clique roll it
Ride around the city no tints on it
Get money throw around like dick to these hoes
Stick to the code, you murky water
But you only like hip to the toes
I'm hip to it this how you get to it
You ready? Get to it take another hit to the heady
Wooo! Take another sip now
Nigga get a grip, get a grip nigga sprint to the Feddy

We never say sorry, fuck the authorities
I get stamps from customs, you get them from the club man, check your priorities

[Verse 2: Bas]
Nigga, Fuck lions, tigers and a bear too

Ced on the beat, this is year two, bitch all of my dreams just seem so lucid
Man what is life, I don't know but I love this life
Last Winter, Four hundred nights
She a freak in them sheets all one at night
But don't tell you Niggas never see me Black Santa in Santarelli

Chillin' chillin'
Tired, you shouldn't have been fuckin' wit' these bitches last night

Yea buddy, ahh, hold on a second, hold on a second

[Verse 1]
Matty P, the baller, I call ya in a minute

Pussy like credit, no limit
Imma spend it in a sec, why Daddy what you mean, I was finished
Rolled the spinach, fancy dinners, yea
Yea right, Hoe say hello to Ham and glutten grimace
I ain't broke, flying Frankfurt out to Venice
Floss so much, reprimanded by my dentist
He said "Bas man, you gon' pull your teeth out"
My bitch walk around like Prince, with the cheeks out
My connect on Deck, bring the reef out
And if I'm there, bitch I finna bring the streets out
So fuck a beef, cow, bull and a mill
Shoutout to my Emcee niggas in the Ville
Finna get this paper, stack a couple bills
High up to the sky, that's a couple mil
Bas

[Under transcription][Intro: Sample]
Do you still believe in love?
Or do you like drugs?

[Verse 1: Bas]
Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary, Fiend

[Hook: Bas]
It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?

[Verse 2: Bas]
She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say "Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking
Stand back, catch my amazing graces
Photo finish and fornication
Photo finish and fornication, fiend

[Hook: Bas]
It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?

[Bridge 1: KQuick]
Feel the buzz
Can you feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz, ohh-whoa, yeah
Do you believe in love?
What's your drug? What's your drug?
Ohh-whoa

[Bridge 2: J. Cole]
Take it all the way from the beginning
Yea, yea, yea
Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that lets people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that...

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, um world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'
He made it rappin', now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
(It's lit, feel the buzz?)
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
That's deep

[Outro: Bas]
Feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz?[Intro]
It's Bas, It's Bas
Super Mooking Fiends, Super Mooking Fiends

[Verse 1]
Hello, I'm back again
Money under mattresses
Flying over atlases
First-class, so to see
Turned into some mattresses
All my niggas down
When my niggas in the deficit, blowing out the pound
Cause my niggas depressed and shit
Money is the issue, Ha
Right up of the press and hit every corner
Hopping out her dress, and I barely know her
Maybe Mama didn't show her, Papa wouldn't hold her
I show her shit she's never seen, I'm the wick
Dip inside her kerosene, You ain't special, must be on that Ketamine
On my level, bitch I'm so serene, sureal
Mooking with the Fiends, oh foreal

[Chorus]
3 Rules that I follow

Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Could you be what you seem, Amazonian queen

(Verse)
Vines in the ravine
Swing down from your throne and bow down to your king
What a life we chose, nothing but hoes
The good ones, few and far between – getting hard to see 'em
Come on Eileen, could you be my visine
I’m in need of your light, could you be my high beam?
Only for a few nights, I ain’t quite what I seem
In your city couple times a year, you know what I mean
Yea, you know what I mean
Bitch, you know what I mean
Girl, you know what I mean
I don’t move keys but I got room keys
All the salty women leaving on a sour note
All the sweet ones end up chiefing on my dab of smoke
Only evening that’s in question we was laid up at the Weston
Keep some candles that be scented, until it does
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
For the loud  gotta dampen the sound yea
Gotta dampen the sound yea...[Verse]
Quarter water raised me
From a boy to a man
Like the shore to the sand, nigga I’m just tryna be free
I got a plan that you wouldn’t understand
Inmates to the man, now the BC’s
See this is Attica for the soul
Revolution, barricade all the doors
Let 'em know my soul ain’t for sale
And won’t be concealed in no type of cell
A cubical, the resistance different than a cuticle, shit is beautiful
When they try and break ya but they couldn’t graze ya
‘Cause you high up in the sky
Nigga, why you admiring the pie?
Come get you a slice 'fore these muhfuckas eat it all
But life ain’t cake, full of trials and tribulate
But we good ‘cause we beat 'em all
My maker hold my fate and I know we got a date
So I’m good if I don’t see tomorrow
I’m scrapin' up the plates, stuffin' life in my face
Just in case I never see tomorrow
Just in case I gotta see the morgue
Well in that case I hope I see Allah
And ask him why he had to take Amir
Man I really miss ya, it’s been too many years
I see you and your sisters, I see you and your kids
I see my aunt crying, man she spilled too many tears
But know this, fuck showbiz
If I make it anywhere, your kids already there
And boy you know we think about you every year
Every month, every week, every night in my sleep
I hope you come and visit like you do my pops
Man I just wanna kick it like we used to
Allah, please give a nigga blues clues
Why you take him? Why you spare me?
‘Cause I remember clearly
Sounds in my ears of them bullets flying near me

[Hook]
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today

Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
All my niggas just fly, yea fly, yea fly
Let’s go
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
Boy fly, yea fly, yea fly

Y'all hear the voice, y'all see the name, nigga
Biggie, it's Queens
Y'all know everything Barack Obama Special over here
He lets it fly

[Intro]
Juice
This one is dedicated to
My bitch ass neighbors, ha, ha, yeah
'Cause I'm livin' better now, better now
Bitch I'm livin' better now
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I had to move 'cause my neighbors so racist (Fuck niggas)
My new crib fly though (Sheesh)
Lookin' like the 4th of July though (Fiends)
Lookin' like a frosted gelato (Dam)
Cool as a chill, Navy Seal, nigga (Pew, pew)
Hot as the heels on a field, nigga
Puttin' in work, fuck how you feel
Buy my family trips, fuck value meals
Only lie to police, I ain't tyin' your leash
I got higher motives, fuck lyin' still, I am on a whole 'nother level
Got up out the street, ran up in the industry
Just to see, that I'm dealin' with a whole 'nother devil
Whatever last, smoke buddah, make more Gouda cheese
My whip European but the kid Sudanese
Got a laundry list of niggas with the list of they needs, holy
Them cats is prone to actin' phony
Get no actions ask the homies, you ain't know?
We miles ahead, the matrimony's dead
No time for fakes, my niggas make mistakes
Heard it all, the commentary's dead
They go to state, don't get no GPAs
Got GTAs, the commissary's fed
I pray to God, I call in my request
I tell Him my regrets
I tell nobody else how it feels, I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Chorus]
I tell em my regrets
(Tell me things and old desires)
I tell nobody else how it feels
I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Verse 2]
I can tell you're apprehensive and I can't ask why
I'm like fireworks in the Baghdad sky
I might b'e the second coming, I might be the end all
But I keep her comin', especially off the Henn' dog
In the end all rivers, lakes will dry out, but us involved we gon' leave a ocean of salt, Lord
So many love's lost, let me count it with the gloves off
I need more fingers, Cole lingers long in my soul
Got my eyes down but I can't find ground
Ten toes holdin' the floor, like I'm tied down but I can't find ground
We the same, thought you came from the roots too
So love ain't love like it used to be
You abstain from the blame if you chose to
But I'ma be here some years so get used to me

[Chorus]
Tell me things and old desires
I tell nobody else how it feels
I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Verse 3]
'Cause for his new recital he go suicidal
Not me, blue recital, hit the main stage, I'm the coolest I know
How I maintain empty bottles in the silver buckets, say it's luck
Come and spend the day with us
I've been up the past 48, first 48 going great
Forty states in forty in days, got them motherfuckas goin' crazy
When all they waitin' on is me and I been waiting long to see it
Bassy

[Outro]
When you milk, you milk, you can't deny the milk
The only way to go is the milky way, my boy[Intro]
How did you know
This is what I always wanted
Could never have done many thing
Where you quick taking me? I might tumble
I’m trying, will somebody make you just shut up about it?
Can we settle down, baby?
No, let’s ride

[Verse]
I’m wired nigga on molly and Red Bull
Party with the fiends you know ain’t no party in civil
2 devils on my shoulders and I’m just caught in the middle
Got decisions to make, the decision’s been made
I swear these bitches screaming YOLO fore they sniff the yola
Feeling like a Porsche 4 door, used to feel like Corollas
My niggas still moving the yola, till they fill the quota
Popo on em like they just paroled
And fuck the help, they never showed em
So we outchea, get it by any means
I’m on fire; no lying, them boys remind me of anti-freeze
And my engine keep running, I’m supplying the energy
Ain’t a thing, you great a sin, I’m high on the canope
Looking out for my niggas, keep an eye on my enemies
Bitch, I’m just where I plan to be
So fuck what you say
This a new CBA, your favorite rapper’s been amnestied
Don’t pretend to be classy, ho
‘Cause I prefer nasty hoes
Test driving broads, ho I’m a car show
Pockets all stinch if I see them narcos
Prolly gonna pinch, nerf a nigga in the stick
The prison’s like the man, it shoulda gave us bar codes
Heart cold like it’s waiting to be transplanted
Band wagon feeling, guess I’m grant standing
Got them hoes on all 4’s, guess they can’t stand it
Shouts to oak shades, shouts to bandanna

[Hook]
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, one bottle won’t do, no
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, two bottles won’t do, no

[Bridge]
I check the homies and I breeze
And chickens hit my phone up, say they only wanna please
Some niggas actin phony ‘cause they only want a piece
I’ll be it, I see through, I never deceive you
Fiend

[Outro]
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue[Produced by Willie B]

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie

Revenge of the Dreamers! Dreamville, it's official, we here. Happy New Year! 2014, it's ours. This is J Cole, Cole World. Make sure y'all enjoy that tape man, Revenge of the Dreamers. That's my gift from me to y'all on my birthday, it's the opposite, I wanted to give you something on my birthday man, that really solidify the Dreamville team that we got. We appreciate all the love and support, leave us a message, let us know what's on your mind, let us know how you feelin', watch out for that Bas - Last Winter, watch out for that Omen - Elephant Eyes, and you know i'm always cooking up, I ain't giving y'all no news this year, no info, just be ready... peace1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga[Produced by Willie B]

I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed
Never met death, well, at least not yet
Off to the place where they rest under flowers
Niggas get wetter, like sex in the shower
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?
I know the world is going to come to an ending
Before it does can finish up my sinning?
I see the devil grinning, as if he was winning
This is the bottom of the ninth inning
I'm coming back like light skinned
What a sad sight, looking at my gas light
Like "Damn man, I just threw 10 in"
Look five dollars won't get you what it use too
And look, love don't mean what it use too
And everybody and their mommas on youtube
Is it just me, or is this unusual?
Don't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll
So let me slow down, to the beat ya'll
Put the remote down, move your feet dawg
One time for the niggas holding heat ya'll
Keep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt
See me, I rather cut catch her body give birth
If you were the last nigga walking on earth
Turn yourself and clap your hands like this was church

[Hook: J. Cole]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I say money make the girls go down
They say money make the world go 'round
So my broke niggas, ain't it a shame
If Bill Gates made it rain
Then world goin' drown
Can I get a dollar?
Shawty got a low Impala
Made that ass drop, hydrola', holla!
Know she got a man, and I don't understand
Why he don't grab that bitch by the collar
Follow, look uh
I need my women a little hood
Living in a world where bad means good
That explains why the bad hoes attract 'em
That explains why the bad rappers go platinum
Or gold these days, go DJ
If the world stops spinning like a old DJ
Keep playing, I need a little more time
Pre paying, just a few more dimes
We slaying, keep praying, hoping
2012? You gotta be joking!
Ain't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign
But +The Whole World+ done lost they minds
Look, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville
This is not a test, this is not a drill
This is all real so before we all kill
Let me get one more feel. Baby!

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Lil Cole]
Yeah, hey
Duck motherfuckers, run for your lives motherfucker
It's Lil Cole nigga. hahaha
The world is coming to an end nigga (It's coming to an end motherfucker, haha)
It's coming to an end trust me
I see it all revelation motherfuckers, all that shit
It's Lil Cole, you know I'm going in straight in to heaven nigga, holla at me

[Bridge x2]
Earthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes
You meaner than Katrina baby I gotta know your name
Before this thing is over this might be the last song
For the man upstairs put the lights on and shut this party down

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like

[Intro]
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And I'm all up in that spot
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Throwin' blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like

[Outro]
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey[Verse]
Yeah, grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega Man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, a real black queen
If I had a genie, I'd wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house this shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know this shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying "Get off me!"
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only twelve
I wish I wouldla bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared a nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, ayo genie last wish, free my nigga[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
For your eyes only[Intro]
Okay, I lied
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood—true lie
See, I would, but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo' bitch, give yo' niggas dap
The hood gon' ballistic
Cole was here and you missed it
That nigga walk like Obama man
Shook yo momma hand and then kissed it
This pimp shit, this pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard, no wimp shit
Put in that work, no temp shit
Ya bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rapping shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggas move 'caine like Kappa shit
Can't map this shit
From no bed springs in my mattresses
To fuckin' these bad little actresses
I'm bad as shit, ha

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Chorus]
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit, bitch

[Bridge]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce

[Verse 2]
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight, put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
So if you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the newer shit, rockin' jewel shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable?
Keep niggas on they toes, no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole

[Outro]
My nigga Syience killed this motherfucking beat[Verse]
Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes—but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathia's
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD—album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late MC whose name was The Notorious—
Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back
Next up to bat is my nigga, Bas
After that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's that New York City kid plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I[Intro]
Sing, oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong

I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas, sing!
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga

Fayetteville I need y'all to make some motherfuckin' noise one time
Tonight, goddamn it for your motherfuckin' selves[Verse 1: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth
Now, if you was the last man walking on Earth
Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church
Hey
and clap for him

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream

I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command[Verse 1]

You could say I’m preheated
If money talks, mine telling yours to be seated
Cut my leg off, I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game, bitch
And you can retweet it
E-mail the shit, make sure you Cc it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I be in the airport, damn near barefoot
Security hollering out “Cole, we need it!”
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinking, I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain’t no fucking G, boy
Your style G-rated
Hatred is flattery, glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late, now it’s happy belated[Intro]
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul

Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)

Of Devil's pie

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

Can't take it when you die

Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills

Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'...

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

[Verse 2]
Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die

Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart
And hope to die
With my slice of Devil’s pieRecently there’s been a trend that includes rappers saying something offensive, only to be attacked for it in the media and pressured to apologize. I have to be completely honest and say there’s a part of me that resents that. I view rap similar to how I view comedy. It’s going to ruffle feathers at times. It’s going to go “too far”. I do not believe that an apology is needed every time someone is offended, especially when that apology is really only for the sake of saving an endorsement or cleaning up bad press.

With that said, this is not the case today. This letter is sincere.
This apology IS necessary.

In a recent verse on the song “Jodeci Freestyle”, I said something
highly offensive to people with Autism. Last week, when I first saw a comment from someone outraged about the lyric, I realized right away that what I said was wrong. I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant enough say something so hurtful. What makes the crime worse is that I should have known better.

To the entire Autism community who expressed outrage, I’m moved and inspired by your passion, and I’m amazed at how strong you are as a unit. I have now read stories online from parents about their struggles and triumphs with raising an Autistic child and I admire how incredibly strong you have to be to do so. It’s touching. It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real shame. You have every right to be angry.

To anyone suffering from Autism, either mildly or severely, I am sorry. I’m bound to make mistakes in my life, but in my heart I just want to spread Love.

I want to educate myself more on Autism, and I’ll gladly own my mistake and serve as an example to today’s generation that there’s nothing cool about mean-spirited comments about someone with Autism. People with this disorder and their loved ones have to go through so much already, the last thing they need is to hear something as ignorant as what I said. I understand.

To the parents who are fighting through the frustrations that must
come with raising a child with severe autism, finding strength and
patience that they never knew they had; to the college student with Asperger’s Syndrome; to all those overcoming Autism. You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere apology.

Much Love

-Cole[Intro]
"Yeah, nigga
I'mma go ahead and murder this shit
Voice gone and shit, I think it's gon' make it sound a lil'–a lil' ill...
A lil' iller
Yeah, fayettenam... nigga."

[Verse]
Yeah, Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya na’ lie
My world a little darker, like a fuckin' tan line
Go on, look for a better nigga: girl you can’t find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma’am, I’m an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I’m armed and I’m Fayetnam’s finest
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion 'cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it’s all said and done I’mma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins. Bad chicks? Send em in
Basic hoes? Toss em out, can’t even get Waffle House
Hatin’ niggas? Chalk em out. Go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about? Lil man
My shit here burning, you not even lil’ tan
I’m ill enough to kill cancer: baby, I’m chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you-know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, "girl, I don’t care"
You better get yours fore I reach mine
Cause then I’m throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum: Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I’m quarterbacking, trying to get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever, Cole is like the leader
Of the new niggas, to tell the truth I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of you niggas get lapped, I sit back
And reflect on the rap game
I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out “The ‘Ville, I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that vagina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer
I could give a fuck as long as there’s something that’s behind of her
Got the type of bump that make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I’m the shit...oh yeah, I’m reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem
And I’m ghost[Verse 1]
I hit the weed, I told myself the last time would be my last
I don’t trust my own niggas, now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass
Boy, you know my L’s dirty, if they stop me I’m goin' to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me
"Man, let me out, send me back to bitches that smell purdy"
And all I gotta do is call once and she 'dere all ready
Yeah, buddy, can't you tell I'm goin; through hell
I don’t even open my mail
I’m in the shower with soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now i’m getting plenty money

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 2]
Look kid, its raining outside boy
Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin’
Cole the wrong one bringin’ the city shine
All he ever doin’ is paintin’ pictures of crime
Tellin’ stories of pain, paintin’ pictures of dope
Bitch if you listenin' I’m paintin’ pictures of hope
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin’ my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin’ the streets hey ma I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin’ hoes, was out hoopin’
Them niggas wasn’t ballin’ but yet they was foul shootin’
So meet the newest role model who don’t know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch

[Hook]
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Outro]
Girl it’s been so long, I’ve been gone from you
But you ain’t gotta worry ’bout the thangs I do
It’s hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon’ know our name
Ain’t seen you smile in awhile
But I been dreamin’ ’bout you[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

[Hook]
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free

All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

Every time I step outside I see my niggas die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying to pull away.  At no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took off running

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired 7 more shots and my friend died

[Verse 3]
Forget this chain, cause this ain't me
Though I'm eternally grateful to Jay Z
We so elated, we celebrated like Obama waited until his last day in office to tell the nation, brothers is getting their reparations, hey
A man can dream, can't he?
No disrespect, in terms of change I haven't seen any
Maybe he had good intentions but was stifled by the system
And was sad to learn that he actually couldn't bring any
That's what I get for thinking, this world is fair
They let a brother steer the ship
And never told him that the ship was sinkin'
But I got other shit to think about, like my bank account
Forget that watch, you paid too much for it
You 'ought to be ashamed
When brothers back home be dreading when the seasons change
Cause they ain't got no heat and they ain't got no AC
WalMart distribution fired my homie, he just had a baby
You wonder why it's been so many B and E's lately
While brothers from the hood shooting like this is TNT lately
And since all the ballers leaving college early
I turn on the TV and don't see no brothers with degrees lately

[Bridge]
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around

[Outro]
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is be free
All we wanna do is take the chains off...Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrows
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rose
Playing Jigga hits he say good, make more those
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digiornos
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the 'caine
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I've done been a nerd
Just to tutor bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I'm just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got her coming now he might've been the first
So she only fuck with hymn/him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you're black they won't employ ya'
Well nigga I'mma show ya', this that Jesse Jackson
Af-firmative action so master I'm taxing uh
Don't let the cover fool ya', bitch I ain't no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don't gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a Ville nigga 'til the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know what I paid for this shit? bitch, you got damn right![Verse 1: J. Cole]
See your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
What she do, double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how man dogging me
My best friend say, don't tell her nothing 'bout me and you
Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy
My best friend say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I’ll be there, I’ll still be there for you

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me
We breaking up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, than you start listening
To friends, and then it, gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

[Bridge]
My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says

[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]
I’ll still be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling, let me know whats on your mind
We’ve been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I’m never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey[Produced by Omen]

[Intro: J. Cole]
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)
You know who this is dedicated to

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez

[Verse 1: Bas]
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?
Bitch, I don't care
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Got a bitch like a diamond
Bitch got no flaws
See the switch when she walk
Give the bitch an applause
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want
Fly to another continent if I want
Ride through the projects if I want
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, TDK, TDK
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite
I don't talk much, but I say a lot
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot
When we sweating in the dark don't run
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run
She a square but that ass rotund
She let me cut samurai shogun
Know you heard bout the backstroke
I can make your perm turn to an afro
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches
Nice girls, classy women
I'm too official
Dreamville, nigga too official
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?[Produced by Pharrell Williams & Sounwave]

Yeah
Ten toes to the ground
Yeah

[Hook 1]
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight these demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain? blaow
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight them demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?

[Verse 1]
If I quote it nigga, I wrote it nigga
Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga
Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga

[Hook 2]
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?
(Right there let me get that there
Talk about it)
Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?
(Talk about it)
Nada
(If you really believe it, gotta talk about it
You heard about what happens when you talk about it
Niggas lookin’ at you funny when they start to doubt it
Fucking up your energy when you start to doubt it too)
Rollercoaster ride
(Start to doubt it too)
How much do it cost?
(Start to doubt it)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost
(Shoutout my nigga Ib)
Rollercoaster ride, how much do it cost?
(El Presidente and shit)
(He want me to talk my shit for y'all)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost

[Verse 2]
Cole world you should stay off this dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand

[Outro]
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker
"When you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...
(Censor Tone)[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?

[Outro]
Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 1]
Hey, I came up
I warmed up, the next up
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Now don’t it sound legendary
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up and bitch I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say: "What you fighting for? The game is on life support"
And Gary Coleman just passed: life is short
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early just to get in free
And wait for hoes to show up
But now its bottles at them tables, bring the models boy
I’m about to po’ up
Uh ha, you know what
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Left side, left side
Right side, right side
Left side, left side, hey

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 2]
Mama said I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever
Ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go
Hit the club she drop it low
Lower than my credit score
Account overdraft what I got this debit for
So much debt it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle
You border like Mexico
Hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at?
And what ya cook like?
She said "where ya bread at
And what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other well brother good night"

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest
Yeah, hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 3]
Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles
You mean to tell me everything gon be fine
If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you could blow up
And maybe you could blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow upLa, la la la, la la
La, la la la, la la la

Hey, this is a song for my haters

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point us right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music business is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane"; My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

This shit is a giftJ. Cole - Born Sinner (Standard Cover)


J. Cole - Born Sinner (Deluxe Edition Cover)[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
"Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made"
You know what he'd say? "You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit," hah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

[Interlude]
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)[Verse 1]
Yeah
Yeah

Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down
Uh, break the break down...

Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down...[Bridge]
I wasn't looking for you
I wasn't searching
I wasn't creeping around
I wasn't lurking
I wasn't sleeping around
I wasn't thirsting
But, I got a thang for you
I got a thang for you

[Verse 1: J Cole]
You on ya job, and it's damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you
Hey, baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make a man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through ya city, I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminding you of Friday
I can take you to DC introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parle, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room, we call this do the hard way, hard way!

[Hook]
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend

Bring em in (x4)
And if they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the grrr! It's just you, me, and them

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl you lookin' like the new Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
A stewardess and yet you flew the leer
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for ya
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catchin' bodies
How I'm stretching you, guess no need to go get pilates
When I'm sliding through ya city, meet me in the lobby
And you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the morning? while you moaning probably
Got you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a hobby
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy
Don't mind me, I put it down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J Cole]
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons
Whisper to ya home girls you love Cole World
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse you know
The type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf footballs
I got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth
Because I'm so clever better than ho-eva
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed, the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (Ahhhh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's 0-11, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you so fed up, and so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header
I won't let up

Boy I'm higher than a mountain's get

When they go down, profound with these pronouns
Ladies lovin J. Cole now

And I can understand why niggas sayin Dom is next
Let's talk about now though
I'm still the new nigga these new niggas look out for
"Well Damn Joe" that's what Chicago niggas greet me with
These niggas really not eatin

I only want her for tonight man you can keep this bitch
Peep this shit I got my 20's
Got my 50's I got my hundreds I got my 1's

A real nigga know, when a real nigga's done
If you want to be a King then I suggest you vote for Bun
Like that[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, caged bird
Some'n' like a caged bird
Caged bird
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You ain't a man till you stop chasing your friends, my nigga
Think for yourself, make your own plans, my nigga
I'll be lying if I said I ain't understand, my nigga
'Cause who you gon' follow when the leaders all get swallowed
By reefer clouds and bottles
In and out of county jail
This is hell, see the young black males in packed cells
With they heads down
And they fists clenched tight
Thinking, "I could bust a hole through this wall
And, bitch, I just might."
It's just like the caged bird; I sing a song
Hoping they open up these bars and send a nigga home
I cry when I'm alone
I'm wondering why would God send me here
Knowing that they hate us
Knowing that they make us feel like we evil so we kill our people
Without a second thought, in every lesson taught by OGs
We full of real nigga wisdom, so we proceed
Like real niggas who been stripped of our humanity
I see the judge's eyes, I know that he ain't understanding me

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage

[Verse 2: Omen]
Well, it's the oratory vet
Turned down king slash poet laureate
Used to paint a picture with a story of neglect
I could've been a shorty drinking 40s on the steps
With a shorty on my lap
With a shorty on the way coming shortly to protect
I could've been a dealer in the party with the X
But I'm hardly in the mix and I partially confess
I definitely got a couple parts in me that I regret
Is the cup half-empty or is it half-full?
I fill mine up with Hennessy, then get back to him
I'm just a jazz musician trapped in a rap form
You think you standing for something you on a trap door
Well it's the, Mr. Introspective
I'm a dreamers dream, a sort of an inception
I never fiend for the scene but I dreamed of the things
That a Mercedes brings, like slow sex with fast women
Drinking cognac I'm past grinning
A sexy dress, fat ass in it
But still hit it till I'm half-winded
Cause niggas tell me I'm the shit when I be hitting all these dimes
See I'm caged by the visions of the blind
I started as a king
Turned to a slave
Put us in our chains
We was forced to entertain
Thinking bout the present day I'm living off the stage
Wonder if a nigga ever get up out this cage
As I sing

[Hook: J. Cole]
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Yeah, caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion

This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years

A brother's tear spilled on this page

And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage[Intro]
Yeah
It's therapist
The golden child
Yeah
Peep what I'm saying
Yo, yo, check it, yo

[Verse 1]
Yeah you cats is fly but your plane is crashing
You came and passed
My range blasting
I came slashing
Same fashion
That OJ stabbed him
My brain's packed with more lines than caine addicts
These insane raps should stay wrapped in a Straitjacket
You featherweight class bitch
Don't want mine
That's why your whole squad is telling me
"Pick on someone your own size"
I got the whole nine
Ain't perfect but I'm border lining
My album come with a surgeon general's warning on it (Sick)
I spit a born vomit
The hot shit
Even when I die shit
I'll still be the livest
Quit with the nonsense
You hating but you feeling it though
Stepped on stage
Got arrested for stealing the show
Stealing the zone
Never left it
Niggas never contested
On a five star scale you get one less then Texas (Get it)
I got narcoleptics
Why the whote now
When this shit goes down
Niggas barely show up when I show down
I hold ground
Go more rounds than carrousels
And you beating me only happens in fairy tales
You dreaming
My pieces is so dope you feinding
That Cole flow you sink
When I dive off the deep end
I'm head hunting
Heads front
But ain't said nothing
So heads up or spill red blood cause your head is gushing
Bitch what
No STD's
But still a sick fuck
You blast from point blank range and never hit once
I'm heaven sent
From devilish
To Specialist
You niggas couldn't make a good impression of what cements
So throw up the white flag
No need to fight back
Drop your mic
Head to the freezer
And grab the knife pack
Get your lights snatched
I'm cold as the ice cap
Sold my soul to satan
Turned around and stole it right back
I'm jacking dead broke folks cause I'm dirt poorer
I tried to ball but fouled out in the first quarter
Flagrant rhymes
The facts that you proclaiming
They aiming the same phrase as mine
Taking the same frame of mind
I'm out to shine on any track that I'm hopping on
Changing album names
The false alarm
It's not the bomb
The style is off the wall
Kick shit like Bandhan
Therapist is the man
Hands down like a handstand
With a grand flow and my heart had to follow
I'm so ahead of my time I wrote this rhyme tomorrow, what[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do
Uhh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

Miss Fat booty, man I seen it from the front

And that ass was right, shit would make a fag look twice
So I approach like “shawty , whats good with cha?”
Nigga was hopin’ to go back to the hood with ya
And yeah I see them other niggas tryna look at cha
Wouldn’t slang the thing right even if they could get ya
Me I’m from the Ville where we learn how to mack well
And you gon’ yell when I hit it from the back well
Take you to the crib and throw on a little Maxwell
Grab a condom know cause, shit, I don’t know you that well
Haa, was fucking with that
Far from hater but see dem brothers was wack
So don’t you worry bout them mean muggin’ girl

No ice but I’m cold though
Cologne on my nuts in case she might wanna go low

So think twice or take the same advice from the fo’fo’

A Carolina nigga, I’m the muthaf-ckin logo
Shit, fly as hell on my ozone shit
Disrespect me nigga you could get your cornroll split
And that goes for you too, I’m on my Bono shit
Niggas got no delivery thats that Digiorno shit

One day, you're gonna understand...
Can I holla at you? Let me holla at you!

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Special, never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a, son to his mother
Or a, sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don't even speak
But know it's love though
Could never let em' dirty your name
I got the utmost respect for you
Came back home and had to check for you
Word round town is you locked down
Some older nigga snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be—
She like, "If you was me you wouldn't wait for me
Living fast and wouldn't mash the brakes for me"
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me
The day you played my momma you played me
Can't believe I let you in my heart nigga
I should've, followed my instincts a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sense danger in my house
I was too young to scrap you but damn if I ain't want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you
Uh, thirteen years knew you more than my real pops
Put me on to 'Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops
Who would've thought you'd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga "why you lie?"
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppings
Heard you tryna' talk, tell that punk don't call me
You ain't shit and I'm scared it rubbed off on me

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit I hope it ain't true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you
Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don't know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing, you expecting me to act strange
Ain't holla but you on my mind nigga
I dont forget the good times nigga
White tee's in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
We had potential to be monumental, 'ville mentality
You know that old kill or be killed mentality
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin' hoes like the old days, but now we overseas, dawg
Congratulations on your seed
Yo my nigga, can I holla at you?

[Hook]
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while
But ain't no better time then now
Can I holla at you? Can I holla at you?
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—[Verse 1]
Yeah
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could
Said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first little taste of paper and I splurged
I guess it's just a nigga urge
This is The Boondocks
I swear, yo, I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be tryna save the world, and then on Friday, I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting, damn
Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live,  my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ay, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me

[Bridge]
But oh no, Lord
You see, I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?
Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be goddamned if I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'ma make it to the top
So I'ma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop

[Verse 2]
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?[Intro]
Yeah
Need y’all niggas to feel me, yo
Feel my pain
Said soft niggas can’t last hard times, yo
Believe that shit
Yeah, (Yeah) aye (Aye)
Real niggas don’t cry
Look, yo

[Verse 1]
Was just a youngin’ with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything I’m wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw nigga, but shit done changed since Maine was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I’m a man worried about my fam
Let me explain
It’s like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit’s sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
You feeling like the world’s on your back so you stumble
In the field like a quarterback get sacked, then you fumble
Jobs don’t call a nigga back, so it’s back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms, the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost faith
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral (damn)

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
But I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no
(ay, ay, ay, yea)
(listen, yo)

[Verse 2]
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weather’s bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like, “Damn it’s ’06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?” (that shit old, dawg)
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate in like three weeks, some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement, uh (rest in peace)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her, she was standing at the bus stop
Wait, man she was eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
Every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)
They killed her only son
Now she wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man, I can’t watch this shit

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Verse 3]
Take a ride through the city man, tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits
Violence, hatred, real devastation
Neighborhoods looking like there’s still segregation
Welfare, single mothers, no jobs
Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
Fiends in the street so high off of that crack shit
This nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress (bang!)
White folks got the road to success mapped and that’s all good
But why don’t blacks got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
And it seems like I done prayed for a million days
But still the ills remain, just bills and pain
Shootouts in project buildings, children slain
Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can’t though

[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Outro]
Yeah, shit dedicated to my cousin Ricky man
Hoop dreams cut short man
Learned he had a baby on the way
Nigga wasn’t even a senior in high school, though
Hold your head man[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes

Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”[Intro]
Yea Yea, uh
It's Carolina, nigga
Yeah
Ay
Fayettenam
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Listen, alive and still kickin nigga
I survived the ville
But a lot will not, so they wield Glocks and Bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill
Money hungry, tryna find a meal
Can't stay inside and chill
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas
Lying like they on the pill
Preachers say we blessed
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel gates
My mind is still- racing, I'm tryna kill- snakes
Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
Yeah

Yo, Coming home, y'all
Listen
At any given time, got the city on my mind
The city on my mind
The city on my mind
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
At any given time, Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine
I'm tryna go for mine

Hey
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show
Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose
Money goes, the money come
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks
The Carolina way
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say
Cause in Carolina- we thorough
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G-boro
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yea
Yo, coming home nigga!

[Verse 2: Deacon]
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like
Ooh!
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'
Blew game and I do my thing
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring
Oh no!
Riding with my niggas for the weekend
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
Ooh![Intro]
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

[Verse 1]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"
This is chaining day

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear
They even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me (ahh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (chaining day)
Love me, my last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (love me)
(Love me) They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear

[Verse 3]
Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said this shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
Cause I love this slavery

[Outro]
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I said this is my last time[Intro]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Let me tell you a little story about my homie Corey
Right now he's locked down serving at least forty
But excuse me, I got ahead of myself, I'm sorry son
This story starts in his youth, he was hardly one
When his pops got knocked for coping rocks
From under cover cops on the corner of his block
And he never got a chance to meet him
Cause the very next year his pops is laying still in the prison cell bleeding from stab wounds, fatal
Bad news Corey's mother and older brother already caught in the struggle
Brother barely ate tryna hustle just to carry weight
The whole family underweight cause they rarely ate
One thing my nigga never got was love
And his whole childhood he was watching drug addicts
His brother supplying it, old mother buying it
You expect a scientist to come from this environment
Get real!, this shits hard enough brought up black
But being poor plus your mums on crack
And your brothers a hustler tryna take you under his wing shit, just a fucking wonder his breathing

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Age five, Corey had dreams to be a cop, but
Age six, his older brother passed the Glock, let him hold it
Plans change, he started his campaign
Age thirteen, little boy doing big man things
And that's what he thought
He was jacking rims from mustangs
Beating down on his class mates for chump change
Running round with the tough gang
The older niggas he sold dope for 'em, they bought clothes for him
However, soon he got older and selling petty dimes turned into some pretty heavy crimes
The shit got to the point where he was stealing rides from his block
Even robbing quick stops
Ladies loved him, he was crazy fucking
Knocking boos daily, pretty soon he had a baby coming
But he didn't claim it, his baby mother was crazy loving him
She said "Baby, let's settle down," he left her hanging
He'd rather be on the streets slanging a wild cat
But god damn i seen it coming a mile back
A drug deal gone bad guns bursting
Now Corey lying in a cell cause he merked him
Whats the moral of the story?, figure it out
So the next time you ask why niggas are wild
You know with out a doubt, don't try and deny the shit
Young black male, a product of his environment

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cause i can't stand to see my people struggling
But what we up against? tough conditions in this life
And they wonder why these niggas all get hype, get high and fist fight
Or why they live like they living, to get ice and cars
No type of jobs, income coming from dicing and robbing niggas in broad daylight
Its hard cause all they know in this life is scars
This mic is all i need to change the globe, re-arrange it and make it so
Niggas ain't in pain no more
Cause they they don't pay no more mind to all youth
Till they got to locking them up and dawg that's the truth yo
Thats the truth yo, that's the truth[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, school girl, cool girl
You dressing sexy and your mama is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folks thang
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool, girl
You got your new hair, it look so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him 'round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it?
It's cause your mind don't match what your ass got
But cheer up, you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're lookin' for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter, you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking...

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the Glock to my head, feel I rather be dead
Hey, am I hopeless? Raised with rats and roaches
Never liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask "what's the matter?" but you can't relate
Living the life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I’m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother, yeah I love her
But things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer
Darkened my heart and I don't know if I’ll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She said she proud of me and I wonder what for?
And once more

[Hook]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey[Hook: J. Cole]
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds
My main chick she got real hair, never had to shop to get hers
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat, but goddamn she rocking them furs
Ball so hard mothafucka wanna fine me, and now the hoe wanna climb me
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching 'oops nigga
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no budget
Go! Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ayy
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?
Next time I'ma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon' shock her
"You're so tall, what team do you play for?" No bitch, I'm a doctor
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah
Float like a propeller, no helicopter shit
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber
Nigga say they pop cause they dont fill they collars up
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up
Bitch nigga...

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (2 Chainz)
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start off with these four bars
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar
I'm rockin' gold bars, whoop your ass with this crowbar
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin' re-coupe
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin' on gas, full service
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit

[Hook: J. Cole (2 Chainz)]
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet

[Outro: J Cole]
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow
Please don't tell my momma I spent my tuition on these bottles
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'[Intro]
This right here is not a preview
I need to let it go, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he's throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying: "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...

[Verse 2]
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them 90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
Cause I'm finta, drop knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dumbies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets, but nigga that ain't really where they were
Acting just like there they were, but who am I to judge?
That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If i had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera, at the same time
And put name tags on they titties so I don’t get they name wrong
Screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from sampling now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas, 
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer
But the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go

[Hook]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...

[Outro]
June 25th. Born Sinner. Bitch[Intro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like...)
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha, bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "when?", bitch! When I feel like it

[Hook]
Cole World (World), Cole Life (Life), Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

[Verse 2]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me (Woohoo!)
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me (Woohoo!)
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story (Woohoo!)
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

Hm, Ok, we're outta here (O-o-o-key-key-key)
I think it's safe to say we outta here
(We outta here, we outta here, we-we-we)
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here

[Outro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night (Night, night, night)
A hell of a night (Night, night, night)
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like)
Hey (Hey, hey, hey...)J. Cole - Cole World: The Sideline Story[Verse 1]
It's hard to picture a nigga not getting money
J. Cole living bummy? Hahaha that shit is funny
I’m focused on that cash, I just laugh at them bastards
Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor’s
And if this rap shit don’t work, I’m going for my Master’s
Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades
A nigga straight A’s like the Braves
She got me in her dorm room, talking bout her room ain’t clean
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leaves
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seeing
Cuz if the girl get excited, she’s invited. (haha)

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh, I hate to brag, well naw, I don’t, the big man on campus
I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga glances
And if your ass is dumb you won’t even get a chance
Cuz I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga answers, yea
And if I hit ya shorty, keep it on the low
This shit just like highschool, people wanna know
I see you haters mad, but I ain’t mad at y’all niggas
We get ass like them basketball niggas, I’m ballin’
Got a sidekick so them hoes don’t be callin’!
Hit me on aim, ay what’s your screen name?
When I start typing in, a nigga’s got some mean game, yea
And when I whip it out, shit she gonna think she seeing things, but
Back in Carolina I miss home badly, (yea)
It’s funny hoes I couldn’t have is tryna bag me
But I’m in the Jeep with this freaky ass Aggy
She said she want it from the back, gladly

[Hook]
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

[Verse 3]
I’m skipping class just to get some ass, living fast
And college with no sleep nigga, my jabs quick as Zab's
So kill that old college gangsta shit we dont believe
You mad cuz your girl on Facebook poking me, so uh
You know the G, I hit her up like “Hello Elle
I see you looking right the other day, LOL
So, what’s good with you?”
She hit me right back like “Shit, what’s good with you?”
You know I like that, so of course I write back
Hit her with some nice chat
Same night she in my room, lights off I strike that
Yea I put game right, but that’s your wife, nigga take her
I bust then I kick her ass out to write a paper, yea (hahaha)
A nigga doing homework, drinking like a fish
It ain’t a weekend that I’m sober
Fighting hangovers on my way to my internship
And I forgot to study for my midterm, shit!

[Outro]
Hahahaha, wooo!
Ay, this is straight through, nigga
No, no fucking, no double takes
This is straight through the whole shit nigga
Check it out man, tryna tell y’all niggas man
College is a good look
A real good look, my nigga
For more reasons than one, man
Know they try to keep us out of that shit though
That shit like extra expensive
I got scholarships though, so you know I’m not sweating that
I feel for my niggas that couldn’t make it man
Ay Mike we in there baby, hahaah
Ay they can’t, they can’t keep us out the G my nigga, you know
Then we all make it, nah, we ain’t all make it
Shout out to my niggas, man
All my niggas, yo
Whether you graduated or not
Whether you made it to college or not, nigga
Fayettenam, yeah, yeah
Class of 2007 man
Holla at me
I’m going to grad school though, you know?[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Back where I belong
I’ve never felt so strong eh
Feeling like there’s nothing that I can’t try
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is my story this is my song
If you ain't got the heart, don’t attempt to try this at home
It’s just a poem from a man once living wrong
Now I’m in the zone, tell the World I’m coming home
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
Who’d have thought we’d be running rap when we was knee high
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
Or cause I’m famous you don’t gotta know what pain is
But I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind
But one thing I never lose is my grind
My closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can’t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
And then help me get my genius out
And get back to what I had
If my good’s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it’s on my diary, I’m living for my kids
Now they is just as fly as me
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that’s flattering but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y’all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, ask me if I gained weight, I said nah
My pockets got fatter, that’s all
Money was an issue but now that that’s solved, I ball, I ball
Like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantel
Dawg my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me
How that feel? Very happy (very happy)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Cole World, Boy, check the degree’s
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze
That’s why I blew up on you sucka’s all thats left is debris
One soldier’s all that’s left is fatigues
Act like you know me boy, I’m Kobe
How the fuck you gon step in my league
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling?
‘Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen
I’m ’bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin’
Killin’ niggas like K K K violence
I guess it’s why they pay homage
Momma I’mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..
Whatever man

[Beat Change]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin’
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin’
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin’
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown huntin’
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin’ like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peatin’
And I’m knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin’
The label heat seekin’, nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin’
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

[Break]
I’m heavy
I’m heavy
Man these niggas get exlusives
Hey, hey

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Man, I’m already hot, you can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your’s “be seated”
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin’ out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinkin’ I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fuckin’ bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just happy he made it
My money was running late now, now it’s happy belated
I’m heavy, nigga I’m heavy[Intro (Sampled): Billie Holiday (J. Cole)]
What can I do?
It’s cost me a lot
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
(Shit homie) It’s cost me a lot (Shit homie)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y’all can see I’m ballin’, HD

[Refrain]
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that

[Verse 2]
Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word

[Refrain][Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Ad-Libs: Choir]

[Outro: Choir]
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Round

[Music Video][Verse 1]
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus]
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Verse 2]
Listen
I got a story for ya, when I was seventeen
I had a name, was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nuttin' new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin'
Going nowhere, I figured, "Fuck it, there's a couple hoes here"
I might as well sign up and climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse, spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage, I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like I dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga, DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat fast, the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak, that is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger that killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again, I begged my mom for braces, then I had a

[Chorus]
Crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
A crooked smile

[Verse 3]
Growing up was just a young knucklehead running wild
Momma youngest, e'erybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile, snaggletooth nigga for a while
Liftin' up my pillow, tooth fairy never came around
Damn, we was po', but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily, look and wonder how my teeth'll grow
They came slow and out of line, I couldn't comprehend
The significance at the time, this crooked smile
Was just another sign saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah, remember Brandy? Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga, Sosa, I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear, J's drop
He got a fresh new pair, and there I was with hand-me-downs
Turn into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention

[Chorus]
With this crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile
This crooked smile

[Outro]
"Crooked Smile". You know what it is. This is for those that's—that's not picture perfect, but we still worth the picture, you know? As I sit here and sip this Corona. Ayy, shout out to Brandy, man. I—I still got love for ya. I'll never forget, we was in the fifth grade, maybe it was later than that, but remember we was at the [?] we had the orchestra thing and you told—you told a white girl, you told her to tell me that if I went and got some braces that you would go out with a nigga [?] shit. Ah, those were the days. I still got love for ya. You know shit like that made a nigga tough[Intro: J. Cole]
Tick
This is for my niggas in the fourth quarter
Just watching that clock tick. Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You said, "at what point do you start seeing bread?
Been out hustling for years, shoe box right under my bed
I move the work out my momma’s house, got me a little old crib
I always fantasize if I had went to college instead
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek I’m better off dead
Fucking with this white, it’s all been downhill like a sled
Now listen, I understand they say you make your own bed
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread
In denial about the feds, he can’t see past bread
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?
These are the times, survival my only crime
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone
Inside of me Lord I know, it’s a lie that we gon' be fine
But momma I’m tired of crying, just lie to me one more time"

[Hook]
Cause it’s crunch time
Cause it’s crunch time
Shit real man
A nigga got bills man it’s crunch time

Shit real man a nigga got bills

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Look, scavenge these records of these days MP3’s
Looking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV’s
This is for nigga’s with empty dreams and empty jeans
Still holding on to the word maybe
Cause this 9 to 5 shit is driving you stir crazy
Coming home tired just to hear it from your lady
Hollering about your baby, need this and need that
And all you want is peace and quiet
Maybe some feedback, on these raps
Cause labels ain’t hollering, and niggas ain't downloading
Nobody see your vision, they walking around blindfolded
All this time holding on to possibilities
You step outside, you smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze
Fuck what they talking, it ain’t like life come often
Only thing worse than death is a regret filled coffin
So try before you die or always wonder what if?
I thank the lord for this wonderful gift
Looking for strength in this crunch time

[Hook]
Looking for strength in the crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg
It’s crunch time, yeah nigga it’s crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg

[Outro: J. Cole]
I feel your pain nigga trust me
For all my nigga’s out there still trying to get it
Few nigga’s I know, few nigga’s I don’t know

Shout out to my nigga FilthE
Nervous Reck
Shout out to Marcus
My nigga I forgive you for all that shit you said
I understand my nigga
Still love. Yeah[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck ya girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy, what you think?", "Little girl, you're growin' up
Growin up"

[Chorus]
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?" "little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Can I get a witness, this is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey, Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up, growin' up"

[Chorus]
Hey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up"
Hey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl

Mama couldn't never reach her

Let me try this
Uh, Yeah
Money coming soon
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
Omen what up nigga?
Yea niggaaaa, yea, uh

[Verse 1]
Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?(true)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that! (haha)
Like fuck it I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks spend dough on mad shit for stuntin,'(yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid. (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things, (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin'
But them whites ain't. (hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation,"(yea)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating,)
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em. (yea)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention, (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition, (ahaha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition, (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't into doing, they into wishin,'

Yeah
Uh
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln[Intro]
Yeah, Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
These niggas is playing
Russian Roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless, no, we don't dance
All we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for eleven minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2]
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be LeBron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it

[Pre-Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled)  & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)

Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Hook]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Bridge]
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me

Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

[Verse 1]
Hey, oh no, not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick?
If so, I take her on a voyage
I like 'em long-legged, mega thick
Work it out, you know, employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit?
Cause I keep clogging up the toilet
Coley Cole, fresh as a 4-week old
Not a scratch on me, hoes ask for me
Niggas ask about me, silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the real, this nigga give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label give you the deal
You remind them of me, let's see, how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will?
Ill

[Verse 2]
Enough of that bullshit cake rap
With your childlike scriptures
I'm busting off, nigga, take that
Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood say "We fucking with you Cole, see?
And we're gonna ride right with ya
Yeah, we know you got college degrees
But we got priors like Richard"
And here we are, raps just like CPR
Nigga turn on your TV, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like E.T., completely we be from Mars
Damn he got bars, as if he's speaking of CB4
Need a barrage of freaky broads to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minajs, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods, and yes
Her ass clap and so that's a round of applause, I guess

What is you discussing?[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Fast lane, looking bad thang with them brains
From the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I’m high as God
Why is it Lord that I can’t seem to slow the whip down?
The same boy standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don’t follow rules
Carter blues, nigga hold up, y’all still don’t got a clue
Yeah, all the cool niggas from high school that still ain’t doing shit
‘Member when y’all used to fuck niggas till they blue and shit?
Now your ass broke as a joke and them niggas doing it
Funny how the tables turned and life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy ‘less he need a dollar from his baby mama
And y’all still don’t wear a condom, is you stupid nigga?
Falling in love with these hoes, is you Cupid nigga?
You better learn ‘fore you burn boy, see me stay on top of my game, David Stern boy
Did this dirt like worms, now my mom was more concerned with the future
Y’all niggas stuck in neutral, this a city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya, I’m here to get ya higher baby so this here the booster
I’m tryna be the king, this that Martin Luther
Shit is crucial, now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ‘Ville, still pourin' liquor ‘fore my niggas killed

[Verse 2: XV]
Look, it’s too bad that he’s too good
Never giving up but it’s sad that you would
My crew like a couple of clansmen, too hood
And when it came to putting on Kansas, who would?
Vizzy, no trying, couple figures on and I’m sitting on Bryants
Game started buzzing so I’m sitting on hydrants
Nah Joe, I’m highjack, you can call me a Somali pirate
All black wallet, inside Irish, mean it’s all green
Yeah, I’m mean with this fly shit, they buzzing like bees in a high nest
Girls getting on they knees for your highness
And I’m running these streets, no bright vest
Stick to the paper, damn, I’m a fly catch
I’m tryna live more, die less and if you tryna get yours, holla X, XV
You should OD off of this rhyme ‘cause I’mma change minds like cold feet
In store for a meal, groceries but they be like “We don’t normally come out at night mostly”
Go and get your rosaries ‘cause I’m about kill this, no halo like Sony
And if your girl a little horse like a pony, ahem, well of course, start pointing
Fly Boy Club, well of course I’m soaring, always gonna
Always be in the air like Jordan
And they always gonna stare, just ignore ‘em
Now you with the X man, I’mma call you Storm
I’m touring her, under that hood and um it’s foreign up under that hood and um
I feel like a dude this cool should feel so I guess I feel good and um XV, J.Cole, we in

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Busting, I'm going off, sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me, these hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club, you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God but to me, she found Satan
She only getting hotter, what's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said “That's cool nigga but can you buy the Benz?”
She playing niggas like a violin, I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day’s found, this is my playground

[Verse 4: XV]
Look, I’mma spit it from the top of the dome, don’t normally do this
But I’m feeling real cool, I am ruthless, like Eazy-E was, I am toothless
Like that one fiend was, I am killing shit like I never do this
I never do this but I’m gonna spit it straight from the top oh
And I know niggas done heard about Kansas but I’m about to do this motherfucker
I done ran shit since ‘02 and I was like oh and y’all niggas don’t know
I’m about to prove man what everything that I’m doing is about to do a movement
X to the V, who you booing? Look, I don’t even do this normally but I’mma do this
Accordingly, cordially, I am dope, yes dude
I have never wrote this shit down in my head
I have spoke shit you that never ever said
‘Cause I’m dope, y’all niggas dead, fresh, chill nigga, I am gonna get this
X to the V, y’all niggas witness, I’m about to throw ‘em back, ruler this
Y’all niggas doing this, y’all niggas know that I’m moving shit
And if you don’t know it right now, google it, I’m about to be on every blog
Doing shit, I’m about to do this shit like E told me do, look, look, I don’t know

[Verse 5: J.Cole]
What do I gotta do to prove to you I’m not the dude for you to just try to fool with?
Niggas ain’t got a clue bitch, niggas wanna bullshit
Don’t know that my crew thicker than these cute bitches, we normally knocking boots with
Too slick to grip, my nigga should stop that
That verse was so old that I done forgot that
But now I come off the top with the hot raps
Niggas know you better stop that
Coming through, got the Glock cocked back
Nigga I ain’t even got one
Nigga, I’m aiming at your face with the shotgun
Lyrically, spiritually
Niggas tryna mirror me but I’m vampire and I’m so damn higher than the average nigga
Can you get witcha ya? I just signed with Jigga, nigga how high you figure?
Damn, I’m slipping up on my words but my verbs so sick that I never slip
Niggas know uh-uh, please save me XV

[Verse 6: XV]
They be like Vizzy on some other shit, on his MCDs ‘cause they loving it
Pockets fat like the Klumps in it, my flow is something sick, no asking
Proactive couldn’t stop bumping it, nowadays I be on some other shit
Ladies think I’m gone kinda like my upper lip, wrong
Like a broken condom, pause, ‘cause Hoff go raw
It’s something you really shouldn’t be fucking with
Came through whipping, paint still dripping
They say like Sheneneh, oh no you didn’t
Know that one saying when your palm start itching?
Well mine do some much, I had to start to wear mittens
And you think that I’m kidding, if I don’t slow down
They gon’ think that I’m driven, if I don’t go down, she gon’ think I hate fishing
Chill for a minute and I was like listen, Vizzy, gettin’, gettin’, gettin’
Y’all motherfuckers know I’m about to spit it straight up off the top of the dome again
How this nigga doing that? He be going in, I don’t even know shit
I be just blowing shit, I don’t even smoke and shit, how you know this?
By enrolling it, I don’t even know I got a backpack on
If you see me, take a flick of me and you niggas gonna blow the shit
‘Cause you were pointing at me like he gonna blow and shit
And them niggas be knowing it, if I be doing this shit all around the world and shit
All around the globe with it, man y’all niggas spit it in, I just get it in
Flow out here and manager from Switzerland, nigga from Kansas
And y’all niggas whipping it, how you motherfuckers doing it?[Snippet]

Oh my god
Uh

Nothing new under the Sun
Nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of lil' niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She diggin’ me and i'm cuffin' her friend
She kickin’ you out while we fucking for fun
I got her sucking her thumb, that my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama, baby
And put Sunday dinner my hand on the gravy
I been on the craziest wave
If I'm on a stage
A M' is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that bark and we sendin' them astray
So in a way we the dog catchers
How many bullets yo dawg catchin'
Sawed off, raw dog fashion
Hold off, hope God catch 'em
Amen

[Verse 2: Lute]
Potato over my gun

Niggas been judgin' my moves
But please tell me what have you done
My cousin, they’ll air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezin'
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don't even need a reason
Loyalty, never treason
Bitch nigga come and see me
Put some respect on my name
Wish I would...[Intro]
For all my ville niggas man
All my Carolina niggas man, (lights off and shit)
All my real niggas, no matter where you come from

[Verse]
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'mma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, "Honey, I'm home."
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer

You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man
My niggas know about the struggle, man
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma[Verse 1]
Aye, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that, a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spitting
This that pulpit, I’m hitting niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of sifting through my mail I feel like Cartwright, bills
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talking man I know how niggas feel

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse 2]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump
They shooting niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up!
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinking that I’m slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'mma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse 3]
Check it
Ay Sallie, I know I ain't been answering your calls
But shit, let me explain- it's because times been hard
Been running around trying find a job
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore
I still got your letters laying in my dresser drawer
You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gonna pay you back”
I got a dollar and a dream[Intro]
Yeah, hey, Cole world

[Hook]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, ya'll on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? my fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "Goddamn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, "Bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will

A loser car-ley I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jay’s lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC A 'n' T, where I found that TNA
Ain’t seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasn’t nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They waitin' on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappin' in diapers
To rappin' in cyphers
Ta doing more numbers
Then all them fuckin' lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you 'bout to get

Yo smile nice yo style right

Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb

I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'—
Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's


[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Aye, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get


[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', at least not with us
Might see em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, uh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher and though I never met ya
I'm thinkin' God bless ya, the city tryna get ya

[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you bet your Momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screamin', "We miss ya!"

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, let's see God, I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny?
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery?
My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m trying to get clear, I’m tryna quit fear
Who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no, baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smoke screen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but it's no kings

[Hook: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they tryna kill ya
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking "God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
Don’t even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the whole season, nigga, no re-runs
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds

[Bridge]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya

[Outro]
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong
'Cause ain't nothing wrong
Im not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass, I gotta ball
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga[Snippet]
(Let me live, let me live, let me live)
Peak in my life, check if you like just what you see
Though you might disagree with my plight
This shit that I write is just like therapeutic for me
There's no shooters for me
Just some niggas that wanna prove to me they down
I rarely bring 'em 'round, cause they still stuck in their ways
Mindstate still the same
Can't help nobody till they ready to change
But I don't give up, I'll be here waiting for you the day you decide that you'll no longer be a slave to your pride
Until then, keep your head on a swivel
For my niggas that dibble, dabble in street life
Hopin' to get a nibble of American pie, equality
An arrogant lie
Told louder by the people that hold power
Listen, this is a setup
I know you feel the rush that niggas get when dollars switch hands
And you can say you got your bread up
But don't be short sighted
See, it's a war that's goin' on outside
Nigga, you got to know about this shit to fight it
I wanna help you through
I'm on the road to sanity with all humanity behind us
Hope they comin' too
These words I spoke are nothin' new
There's nothin' that I [...]
There's nothin' that you cannot do
The truth is right aside of you
Through troubled waters just canoe
Have faith for something greater than to guide you through
These words are for all, me and you[Intro]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets[Intro]
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
Look, some niggas let their dirt out some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade; a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint? Glorify me, over-think?
Say they know me, say I’m great? Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me that they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man

[Hook]
This for them niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a pre-nup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing

[Hook]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah[Produced by J. Cole & Vinylz]

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved[Intro]
Hey, hey!
Hey, yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, up top, hands, sing

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?

Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
Who's the king?
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy lose the Grammy as a nigga crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")

[Hook]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Bridge]
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Higher, higher
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Revenge)

[Verse]
Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat Turner in my past life
Bob Marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
Who survived against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
Who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago, the game snatch a nigga’s spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
First thing they do is throw their shade
Word?—errr—I swerve like a Thunderbird on the curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scriptures
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive
Back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "Hello", just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil
You can tell him Cole just sent you now

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah—higher, higher
Yeah, yeah—higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
I can come around, shit, whenever you want
I can come around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
Me, me, me, me, me, me

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, took a lil' sip
T-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch

[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over

It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch[Intro]
I see the, I see the—
I see the, I see the—
I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

[Verse]
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord

[Chorus]
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

[Outro]
Bells gettin' louder, louder
I see the rain
Pouring down[Verse 1: J. Cole]
The game need balance, the game need balance
Woke up this morning to the rumors of niggas wilding
Picture me hating on a young nigga with talent
Album flop, but it's cool, he caked out on his allowance
I was out in Vegas, Kicks was the latest
Bitch was the baddest, her head was the greatest
Only one thing that I ask of you haters
You can't diss a nigga if you got him on your playlist
From straight A's to A-list, Only niggas with AK's can play this
My Jordan's thirteen like eighth grade, You niggas debaters
But you ignoring my pay raise
I made it from 8 dollars an hour, that's 400 a week
To 100 grand a show, that's 400 a week
Ice and wrist, It's Cole summer to keep
Life's a bitch, Just don't cum in the sheets[Verse]
Crack music, nigga...get smacked music, nigga!
Look, you see them ruby red diamonds on my ice
You can call it what you want shit'll prolly change ya life
If you stole it and you pawned it
You should prolly think twice, well connected so I'm on it
Well connected on yo flight, you niggas be writing sonnets writing sonnets
Like we miss you we miss you
Mama go get the tissue
Them things start blastin, Mark Jackson can't assist you
Life cut short like initials, raps or the pistols
One way or another, I'mma uplift you BLAOW!!
You believe me, then you crazy
All these little niggas out here wanna be me but they lazy
Step ya game up get ya name up
Look how I came up
Remember this bitch in high school I liked said I was lame but
I played it off Deep down I was ashamed
But walking through these hallways, all you got is your name
The boy she liked was g-like and very slang
Whips and fresh clothes and so they doing they thang
I ain't good enough
I ain't hood enough
This older nigga stepped up to me at my locker I said put em up ready to jab at
Much to my surprise that nigga backed back
And went about his way
I threw my notebook in my backpack
Walked home just to get my thoughts goin
It’s a hardcore world if they think you soft porn
Niggas will try to fuck you
And steal, rob, or cut you
And we ain't sellin dope but we still gotta hustle
And this that crack music, nigga thatget smacked music, nigga![Intro]
Yeah
Almost
Almost
Hm
Damn
Hey

[Verse]
So here we are
So here we are
So here we are, it's funny how so close can seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far, funny how so close can seem so far I mean
Nigga, this is your moment
Damn, this is your moment
Damn, this supposed to be your moment, ain't it?
This supposed to be your moment
This supposed to be your moment!
This supposed to be your moment
What good is being the one when you the only one that knows it?[Intro: J. Cole]

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Bridge: J. Cole]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

[Verse: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got twelve slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today

We out here moving, J. Cole is here
This has happened before
When the mics are set up like this
You know something's gonna happen

[Break: J. Cole]
Is it on me?
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
You see us, baby
Funk Flex, J. Cole
Who you mad at, me or yourself

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before "Work Out" I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook

[Interlude: Funkmaster Flex]
HOT 97, baby!!!

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Look
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?

[Break: J. Cole]
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever[Verse 1]
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this Range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin, I never liked carrots
But now I'm older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar, more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but nowadays more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, I'm all on the Billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga, I could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at Warren Buffett
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a Ford, ironic 'cause I explore
Nigga I explore!

[Verse 2]
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy, I can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If I slip I grab the rail, I'll get a grip and never fail

[Verse 3]
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if I ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that

[Outro]
Nobodies feelings getting hurt, nobody getting mad[Intro: J Cole]
LA, NC, NY
The Chi, yea, hey, yea

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I wake up, hop out the shower spray cologne on while im dressing
They hollering about recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, Im live and breathing so to me that there’s a blessing
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no “F” in
Stepping out today, I got leave the crib
Momma stressing , I pray
That ain't no body gon’ pull the weapon out and spray
Cuz I don’t got no strap
And ever since we hit the depression niggas don't know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya’ll feel the glare I got to go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her
I'm fronting “What's your name?”
She told me, “Boy, you know me, don’t play no games
Now, look, they say you blowing up, hey, is it true, fired up?”
I say, “Girl, they wasn’t kidding like they tubes tied up"

[Hook]
I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me whats work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world
Its just me and my favorite girl, now all around they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay so word is spreading
That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle cuz I know they used to say Jermaine
So who changed?
Whats in name though, when niggas can't hang on-your shoe strings
The flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me?- Im just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real
Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!
This is where they shooting sideways
Boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we high to get away
Now come here ladies see we trynna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon mix it with this Goose, don’t throw it up

[Hook][Verse 1: J.Cole]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring him 'round cause her homegirls’ll clown like
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bite size"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about her 5 year plan
She saying “who I’m fooling, they could never understand”
They could never understand

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I’m watching CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep ‘em niggas walking 'round blind all the time
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The single's only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparel
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of all the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates is a nigga fate
And why they call this shit a race
The agony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Bridge: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me

[Outro: 2Pac]
Don't support the Phoneys,Support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talkin about how they so real
And they don't care about our communities?
How can they be talkin about how they're all this you know
The hood and blah blah they don't care about the communities?
You know what I mean? Listen to the words they have in their lyrics
And tell me is that some real shit
And if that's real shit to you
You know what I mean? Listen to what they're saying to you
Don't just bob your head to the beat peep the game
And listen to what I'm saying & hold us accountable for it[Intro]
Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse: 1]
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Peedi started
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures (Ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04
No disrespect to my favorite player
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich
So I'm slaying niggas, yeah

[Hook]
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it

[Verse: 2]
Niggas in the streets, no
Niggas blessed beats
I got that priest flow, heavenly
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock
Just a figure a speech for the Glock
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot (Yeah)
Like a beach yo, it's hot
Niggas laid out
Caught a fake nigga centerfield it's cause they played out
Watch our boys fade out, niggas tryna hate
If he only knew my dick's in his dame's mouth
Just made out, came out the wood-works
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork
I'm getting real green, y'all niggas playing on some good turf
Fake money, scared money, never make money
And a nigga never fear nothing but God
Fuck a facade
I'm just focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit
Nigga I
Yeah

[Hook]
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it
Yeah
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it (yea)
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it

[Verse 3]
Tell 'em Geppettos my niggas in ghettos with Scarface dreams
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screens
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Sling dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yea it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break
They never wanted us to make it, yea
To my niggas smart enough to be smart enough to take it, nigga[Intro]
(Aheee, ahee-iya-iya-iya-eee-e)

Would you love me, then it must be

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer
Uh, you niggas so last summer
On to the new, on-on to the new shit
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me
Two years later bitch we made it on, on to the Blueprint
Now how's that for persistence?
Cole World comin', call back up assistance
Same broads used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball
Put money over bitches, but we still underdogs

[Hook]
Did you miss me? No I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me (With me, with me)?
Up, up and away (And away, and away)
Hey, do you trust me (Trust me, trust me)?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me (Love me, love me)?
Then it must be (Must be, must be) a match made in heaven (Heaven, heaven)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
God's Gift, (Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
Mothafucker this is God’s gift

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Pussy my passion
Man I just can’t help it I see a cookie, I grab one
Lookin' for some nookie, I’m tryna scoop me a bad one
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one
Ever since I got on
I’ve been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on
Ex-cheerleader, hollerin' what’s up
Now her nigga beat her, now that’s fucked up
What type of little fuck boy hit a
Woman, bet he wouldn’t put his hands on a nigga
Ha, I ain’t bitter boy that’s all you
Ha, plus I just fucked her fore she called you
Ha, dry your eyes baby, I’ll drive you home
Older hoes sayin' "My how you’ve grown"
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I’ll survive on my own

[Hook]
Did you miss me? I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me (With me, with me)?

Fuck it, aye
Do or Die, new arrival
Holla at my niggas
You survive you's alive, yo
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto
Money coming soon, the newest model
Your crew is hollow
The type of niggas gobble dick, chew and swallow
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts" uh
More sluts once the money blows up
But them hoes stop if the dough drops
I won't stop though, a chip off the ole' block
I'm from a city where niggas hold blocks
Leave you looking like old socks, damn
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us
The boys is rotten, I know they want us
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus
You kill a nigga, get promoted
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas
So much I just go nuts
Niggas telling me slow up
Never that
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at
Y'all don't hear me
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks, "
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo
They got streets in the city police won't even go
Peep it though, uh
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh
Niggas know my style though, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though
Have your daddy looking for you
This ain't Finding Nemo though
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea![Produced by J.Cole]

So much bass, I mean niggas can't tell where the treble at
On the track, niggas can't keep up, they look, they trailin' back
Now these bustas couldn't catch up even if Id pedal back
Won't lose, bet on that! or be in debt forever
Plus whatever Jigga say, I'm hot

Now these industry niggas like damn, "Jay said all that? "
Same niggas could've signed me, now they gon regret all that
Bet on that! Bitch, this my beat, look how I get on that shit

Needle and thread, hip-hop heads know them drums express youself
Aye look, I tried to school these niggas, they need extra help
I mean they just don't get the message dawg, no text could help
And now I'm on some 'fuck you niggas', go molest yourself
I'm tryna ball til I fall, catch myself, then ball again
Fall to the floor, dust myself, do it all again
Pardon him, sick nigga, never been a bitch nigga
Spit it for them ones like me who never been a rich nigga
Had the dream to make a team and get up off the bench nigga
You fuckin' with me, ya odds is slimma then a stick figure
Get bigga nigga

[Hook]
Hey, blood, sweat and tears, I paid my price
Hey, so come and get this good game
Aye you should come and get this good game
Hey, hey
I pray for days and nights I gave my life
Hey, so you can come and get this good game
Think you should come and get this good game
Hey heeyy

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm just a down south nigga, lil' east coast flow
From the concrete jungle where the trees don't grow
From the 'Ville, where the motherfuckin' streets so cold
Nigga I could show you streets where police won't go
We just tryna get a piece, my nigga we so po'
Why you lookin' at him, wonderin' why he sold dope
Or why she smoke crack? Or why he tote gats?
Gotta stay up on your toes cus if your feet both flat
A nigga heat gon' clap, your heartbeat go flat
The Lord giveth and he taketh, well he repo'ed that
They don't quiver, they don't shake, man they just reload gats
So much beef for a nigga to have a feast on that
Now a nigga like myself ain't had to keep no gat
But nowadays mo'fuckers is weak, won't scrap
So them OG's tell a nigga, "Please, roll strapped"
It's fucked up a nigga man it be's like that
It be's like that (Hey) and it be's like that (Hey)
Them boys from the 'Ville and yeah it be's like that

[Hook][Intro: David Ruffin]
Sometimes I think about it
And my poor heart wants to die about it
Woooooo about the sweet sweet love I lost
And the way I got double crossed
By a guy who was my friend, I see him now and then
But I pretend I'm doing fine, when I'm about to lose my mind

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast
Money fallin out my pockets I got too much cash
Can't fit nothin in her pockets she got too much ass like goddamn
Well if you must ask
We from the school of hard knocks but your crew cut class
Half white but don't think I got a Klu Klux pass
When I'm up in the V, police be fuckin with me
No sir no license all I got here is this fuckin degree
Move along cocksucker ain't nothin to see
Unless you talkin blockbusters, you niggas is not Russell
You more Diggy - me I'm more Biggie
No diss to the young boy im just rappin get bored quickly
Just to make up for that line invite him on tour with me
Show him the game let him finagle these whores with me
Run through they doors with me, hit the Ritz-Carlton for the night
Leave him there with two dykes probably change a nigga life right
What up Vanessa, I loved you that one semester
Thanks to my profession I balled like Uncle Fester
Thinkin about the board I use to have above the dresser
Half the shit I wrote down I did it, its old now got
New goals, plus my money on Manute Bol
Funny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows
Tired of every chick sayin she models before she swallow
So I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals

[Bridge]
Niggas keep askin me how I feel how ya feel
It's Coleee

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not even slightly interested in what ya opinion is
I gotta greater purpose then a hater purpose
I'mma stack paper, hustle just to relax later
Serve niggas and bring change that's a waiter's purpose
Look how I made em nervous, niggas is shakin, I know they fakin'
Okay you a killer right, and Miss Cleo is Jamaican
And Bob Marley is Haitian and me and Beyonce datin'
And Jesus Christ be hatin, got mad love from Satan
For fuckin Sanaa Lathan while Meagan Good is waitin'
I'm the deadbeat father of your little brother
In other words goddamnit I'm a bad motherfucker
It's Cole, it's only right I brought back the soul
Y'all got way too electro, damn near techno
Halfway homo, way too metro
Hennesy XO, Cole flow special
Style like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row
Learn somethin boy, grow yo ass up
Cheap nigga if you was liquor I'd probably throw yo ass up
Matter a fact if you was grass I'd probably mow yo ass up
Last call for you old niggas go and pour yo last cup

[Outro: J. Cole]
Yea, yea, yea yea, Cole World
This nigga Ib...he's a bitch
He told me to talk shit to you niggas, so I'mma talk my shit
Dreamville in the building
I know what y'all want me to talk about, what y'all want to me to discuss
But we'll get to that later; them bitch ass niggas...
My nigga Big Sean in the building
My nigga Canei on the beat[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Now I was dreaming 'bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiending for the mills, I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the Ville, all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spent they time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, I ain't hating, do your thing
I was like a young Simba; couldn’t wait to be the king
Now a nigga is the prince
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass, way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now it's time to eat, I’m letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me, now they acting like they know me

[Chorus]
Keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (shit)
It ain't no telling (huh, yeah)
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (hey)
It ain't no telling (yeah)
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (going nigga, ay)
It ain't no telling (yeah)
Can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, uh

[Verse 2]
Pardon the interruption, a proper introduction is necessary
When your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn’t let me in the cafeteria'n
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians; they looking me up
She got to Jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning "J. Cole", they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin; six feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dollar and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I’m a star; Converses
Conversin' with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains
'Cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though, now they yelling—

[Chorus]
“Where you going, nigga?” (shit)
It ain't no telling (huh, yeah)
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (shit)
It ain't no telling (yeah)
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (going nigga)
It ain't no telling (yeah)
I can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back
Told my niggas "Ay, I'm finna put the Ville on the map
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque."
'Cause I'm ill, bitch, they couldn’t make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send 'em back
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, if you slang, do your thing
Me, I'm like a young Simba; I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water, I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballers
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryna hit they daughters
Sneaking in her crib, but her momma never caught us
What they taught us?
Man, them bad bitches only want the ballers, the starters
We hooping, now the hoes wanna guard us
Uh, okay, so play D—know what I mean?
And I, I, I'll put you on the team
Man, this life is but a dream and I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport
I'm a fucking rap star

[Outro]
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (shit)
It ain't no telling (yeah)
They say this life is but a dream, well I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport
I'm a fucking rap star
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (yeah)
It ain't no telling[Intro]
Now do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?
Do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired? Yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm back on a mission to pay my tuition
Got loans out the ass, what you know 'bout my past?
I was so late for class, hit the probate, get trashed
Fell asleep off the Henny, back in '08, I crashed
With my foot on the gas, thank the Lord I'm still here
No insurance, so now I'm racin' home on first gear
On that morn' I shed tears, asking what I'm doing here
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she just jackin' me off
I needed more
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store
Put my feet on floor, borrow money from mi amor
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round

[Hook: J. Cole]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"

[Verse 2]
Ok my granny just died, but I'm too broke to go
And she asking my fears but she too close to know
Got trust issues I'm trying, where it come from? Don't know
I just block out the pain, blow the fuck up, get dough
See, I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out
My mama don't see me unless I'm on TV, I pray she (dont break down)
She strong, but she need me
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new things
She still a dime, but I always lose change
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains in a new Range
She tellin' me "So much has happened, would've thought you changed!"
We ain't fuck in nine months its safe to say I'm due man

[Hook]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me "Boy, you got your whole life to get old."
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah
Elite Elite Elite, Elite
Ya know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym
Regular benchpressin' the bar
Ten steps up from ya'll, you could follow my lead
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Ya'll holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo, at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at Lebron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
A dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but nah, I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated
I let Elite breathe, yeah
Hey, uh uh uh
I let Elite breathe, yeah

[Hook]
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
Hey, hey[Hook]
More liquor when we ride
Toast niggas, we alive
Golddiggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me? I’m in the front seat, driving like I’m 1 deep
If you want to come see, you know where I’m at
Go-getters on tha rise, toast niggas we've arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big thangs on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Get brains from a dime, how you love that?

[Verse 1]
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now coming
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground running
I ain't never been the one for fourth down punting
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown hunting
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lockpick just to lock shit back
I want "Money, Power, Respect" since The Lox said that
Better stay up on ya toes, this is not tic tac
Yeah, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Balling like a Laker, you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peating
And I’m knee-deep in the game
It's quick sand and I keep sinking
The label heat seeking, nigga ain't sign me
What the fuck was he thinking?
They say I killed the game, that was only preseason

[Bridge]
I’m heavy
Lil' nigga I’m heavy
I’m so heavy, I’m feeling heavy
Carolina I’m heavy
In New York I’m heavy
Out in LA I’m heavy
I’m so heavy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No album to my name and I’m already hot
You can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling yours be seated
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in tha game bitch and you can retweet it
Email that shit, make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I'll be in the airport damn near barefoot
Security hollering out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I dont even be weeded
No point drinking I can’t even be faded
Real recognise real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late now it’s happy belated

[Outro]
I'm heavy
Nigga I'm heavy
Hey, I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga, in New York I'm heavy
Queens, I'm feeling heavy
Fayet-nam nigga, I'm so heavy
I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga I'm heavy[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Bridge 1]
Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

[Verse 2]
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

[Bridge 2]
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no

And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together

Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher

Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one

[Verse 1]
Hey, uh
What up girl, tell me how you feelin’
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in
She said looks kill and I’m tryin to make a killin’
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami, with a super ho team
Tryin’ to bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name
Somethin’ like James, somethin like Wade
If you something like paid you can fuck tonight
Yeah she said fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings, won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money man the head is amazing

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one

[Verse 2]
What up girl, tell me how you been
Ain’t seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then
Thought you was a cutie, though your booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga, god damn
Hey now got a thing for you
It's been a long time comin', I should hang with you
'Cause see way back, I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy’s now, 2 and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah you still got it though
Girl your body lookin’ like a fuckin’ pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl you're on a roll
Do you get brains, did you make the honor roll
Don’t worry bout your man baby, he ain’t gotta know

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire

You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher

[Verse 3]
Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phoney, yeah only 'cause I can give you ends
Too late for turning back, fuck it we continuing
Get your ass in that position, I love to bend you in

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one[Intro]
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom
Then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second
Watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's "Fuck the government!"
They see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

[Verse 2]
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down
And showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics."
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better
For your kids before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?

[Verse 3]
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See, the people at the top
They get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla "Revolution!"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played
Then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution
Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said, what good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself If I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell oh-well sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
Cuz plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top! You watching me nigga?
Then hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down

[Verse 2]
You were my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? yo, she still the baddest!
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down!

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down

[Verse 3]
And these are tough times baby but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A women with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know im down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down[Intro]

Headed south, dog, my mom ain't seen her son in awhile
Yea, I'll sure is

[Verse 1]
Hey, this is the story of a young’n dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin’
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you’ve been gone
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diploma
Damn, gon’ be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I’m following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it’s me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don’t know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don’t give it up in the meantime

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know

Come lets get this bread up

So when you see me, better holla at me

Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay

[Verse 3]
Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A’s
Hey if you’re listening we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z, aye what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see

[Chorus]
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay

And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidaysNigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that don shit
Dom Pérignon shit
Not gon' cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling
Bout as sweet as a jumper on a gay Ray Allen
I’m bout fucking hoes like Ray J wilding
Killing niggas like KKK violence
I guess it why they pay homage
Momma I’ma be BIG and I put that on the late great WallaceWhats love got to do, got to do with it?
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it

(How high?)

Whats love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Then I send it right back to you with it

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Visionary play your position, no missionary
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope
Now picture that
My poetry’s deep now fish for that
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail
Shit you gotta feel like it’s only read in braille
Both did the crime but his homie didn’t tell
So he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell
Thinking well, what the hell I been on
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on
By the time I’m back in the streets like a bachelor
I gotta play the clubs with the old ass woman
Life is a movie, pick your own role
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole
You sit around crying thats like sitting round dying
You wanna touch the sky bitch you figure out flying

[Chorus]
Nigga how high? so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels
Tryna get a nut with your girl
Think I need to quit trying ‘fore some nigga out there try to hit mine
Karma for the Kama Sutra
A lot calmer when the ganja’s through ya
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda
For stashing that marijuana
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed
I broke the law but look I’ll never smoke or steal again
In your courtroom wylin’, I don’t mean to keep smiling
But right now I’m high enough to probably steal a plane
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn’t read?
Would you throw the book at me
What if I’m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy
It’s been a long time coming
Tell my nigga roll me up something

[Chorus]
Nigga how high? so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees

[J. Cole ]
No I dont smoke, maybe once in a blue
When the tension gets thick then there’s nothing to do
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind
My eyes get shut but I open my mind

How high? la la la la
How high? hey hey hey
How high? yeah yeah yeah yeah
How high? la la la la

Is that a shot that you threw little man?
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned
Make it worse, your friends, now when they talk rap
All you hear is “J Cole this” and “J Cole that”
It must be hard for your pride just to take all that
I know your weak heart gotta break off that
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear
I’m burning you niggas and I’m only in first gear
I’m serving you niggas this is only the first beer
12 months from now, you’ll be having the worst year
No tears for the haters, I’m still counting money
Cole ain't dropping, thats real fucking funny
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps
Something like a mummy
But I’mma wake yo’ ass up
Something like your mommy on school day
I smoke two l’s with ya girl this is Cool J

How high?
How high?
How high? yeah
How high? yeah

Whats love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it

So when I get done with that you wanna marry me ha
Play in the backyard so I can bury the cash

[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone
I ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere
My mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head
So Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip

I get up, I see the clouds from my window

And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way

[Verse 3]
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'mma find a way, cause hey
Damn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit

I'm on my way[Verse 1]
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left y'all browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say it's an arousing point of view
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shed truth
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ain't make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prision
You can tell I'm living, right?
Never said I'm living right

[Bridge: Cee-Lo sample]
I'm a fool
Such a fool
For you

[Hook: Cole]
And they like
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
And they like

I'm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
The first to go to college, they say knowledge is a tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard, I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but I'm sad to say it
I ain't learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it
I'm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts, I don't bruise, so fuck y'all reviews
She told me "Cole, I love you rode with you way before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches
And calling brothas niggas, pardon if I cross a line
But all this time knew you was different than all them other niggas"
I responded to her "please don't put me on a pedestal
Cuz I know better and I'm still a fool"

[Bridge] + [Hook][Intro]
Yeah, aye, aye, yeah
One two, one two, aye
Uh, uh, uh ,uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse]
Fast lane, living bad thang, giving brain from the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I'm high as god
Why is it lord that I can't seem to slow the whip down?
The same by standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don't follow rules
Call those blues, nigga hol' up, y'all still don't got a clue
All the cool niggas from highshools that still ain't doin' shit
'Member when you used to fuck niggas up 'til theblue and shit
Now yo ass broke as a joke and 'em niggas doin' it
It's funny how the tables turn in life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy unless they need a dollar
From his baby momma and you still don't wear a condom
Is you stupid nigga?
Fallin' in love with these hoes
Is you cupid nigga?
You better learn before you burn, boy
See me stay all top of my game, David Stern boy
Did his dirt like worms but my mind was more concerned with the future
Y'all niggas stuck in neutral
This the city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya
I'm here to get you higher baby, so this here's the booster
I'm tryna be the king nigga, this that Martin Luther, shit is crucial
Now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ville, still pourin' liquor for my niggas, killed yeah[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...Yeah, my God, Syience

[Hook]
Lord I've been dreaming about the paper

No novacaine and won't complain never
But spit it so hot whenever I drop a verse I change weather
Now hey badder I'm dropping that Floyd Mayweather or Lebron James
Rather so much better than these featherweight rappers I'm ahead of my time
And never pressing rewind

I'ma show you all stupid ass motherfuckers (Coming soon, nigga)
Dumb ass niggas

[Verse 1]
The heir to the throne
South nigga bred to the bone
But haters say he fled from his home (please)
Now picture that, I was 18 with million dollar dreams (yeah)
Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akeem
But ain’t looking for no queen, (nah)
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup)
City on my back, I just lift my wings, I’m fly
You niggas on my dick, why lie?
Thought them niggas from the south couldn’t spit, violá
I’m here. humble out of respect, not fear
So please be clear, nigga please beware
I’m a motherfucking monster, B.S. me? (naw)
No, my hand game like fucking PSP
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon
My dick do the damn thing, honey it’s cumming soon
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (yea)
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave
Rest In Peace, ya’ll boys living too fast
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash
Ville niggas don’t play
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won’t spray?
Mid-day when it’s sunny, they kill niggas broad day
On some old new jack shit
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run

[Hook]
Ha ha ah
I’m the man, ha ha ha, yea hey
I’m the man
I’m the man, (I told ya’ll niggas)
I’m the man

[Verse 2]
Yea, uh
They say I act like I’m the man, 'cause motherfucker I am
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams
Damn boy I'm so flamboyant with the ensemble
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo
And I’m the man, now understand a nigga bossin’, (yea)
Scheming on that drop top CL but it’s costing (yea)
Long term plans for the fam, we’ll be golfing
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless i’m flossing (woo)
In the streets niggas peaceful until you force em'
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss ‘em
Goddamn you niggas got handled
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for ‘em
I know who did it, but you think I’m finna squeal on him?
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him
That’s word, nigga observe my genius
E&J sipping got a nigga straight leaning
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking, (haha)
I told y’all I’m the man, what the fuck ya’ll niggas thinking?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yea
First and foremost, Fayettenam what’s good?
Carolina, what up? Bull city, Raleigh, Charlotte, Salem
Greensboro, Wilmington, nigga
Everywhere dog, I’m repping from long distance, man

Y’all niggas still see me tho, you think I’m still there; you ain’t even know I’m gone
Back so much, nigga

Prince of the city, nigga
Prince of the south, nigga, holla at me
Ya know? Heir to the throne, bitchI'm drivin', nigga as soon as I get the text we all in the car like, "Ahh, yeah nigga, we out here nigga, yeah nigga!!" So we goin' crazy, we goin' crazy as fuck, we like super excited. Dog, ten seconds later, all I see in the back and hear is "woop woop," blue lights right behind me, the fuckin' undercover car, of all things. So I'm like fuck. I knew right away what it was. Dawg, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New York, I was drivin' dirty, my license was no good. Dawg, how 'bout the moment I found out I was gon' get the deal a fuckin' cop got behind me and I already knew what it was. I handled it so like, I handled it the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin', bitch like, ah know what I'm sayin'? I'm in there dog, spendin' the night in jail realizin', like, these niggas have no clue, bitch I'm 'bout to sign this shit (laughs). That was the easiest night in jail a nigga could ever do, sonI need to know, how many people tonight have been fuckin' with me since day 1. I'm talkin' 'bout when a nigga was passin' his mixtape out the fuckin' mall and shit. And you was like, pass me one, nigga. I'ma do this shit even if there's only like 5 or 6 people here. If you got that shit I dropped called The Warm Up, or even if you got that shit I dropped called Friday Night Lights, you gon' fuck with this. Now listen, I know a lot of people here, been fuckin' with me for a long time, but a lot of ya'll, this might be the first album you fuck with, or the first show you ever came to, I gotta let y'all know somethin'. This shit might always be like this, I'ma take you to a new world. Way before we had these fancy LED lights and shit. I don't even know what the fuck LED lights mean, but I'm payin' for them bitches. Way before we had this fuckin' cool ass stage, and shit, man. And definitely way before we had this fuckin' for no reason, stupid expensive video wall behind me. The only thing we had, the only thing we had was classic shit like this[Intro]
Naw, I'm just saying like, I'm just trynna see you, you know what I'm saying? What you was doing after this
Naw, I stay not too far from here, like right down the street-yea like right there

[Verse 1]
Baby you summertime fine
I'll let you get on top, I'll be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason only time could tell, but well
I'm wondering what type of shit you on
Do you like the finer things or are you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed?
Done be ashamed, it ain't no thang, I used to blow trees
Getting lifted
I quit the shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower you, a powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibes
Like you threw something to me-so I threw em back
Now all my niggas hollering "who is that?
Oh boy she bad nigga, what you bout to do with that?"
I'm finna take you home sip a little Patron now we zoning
Baby you so fine

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 2]
Yea, yea now are you shy or is you freaky lady?
Are you shallow cause if not I'll take it deeper baby
Tell me what turns you on
You like the slow songs?
You like some candles lite?
That ain't really my style
But see I planned a trip
And yea we both coming
Just tell me how you want it
I give it to you like I owe you something
When I'm on it, on it like my job
I'm hoping I confess
This life gets hard I can take away your stress if you let me
You knew just what this was when you met me
So let your guard down girl
I'll take your bra down girl and undress ya
Real slow yea I'll make you feel special
I can feel your heart beating fast
From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab
And now ya leaking, freaking ain't no speaking but you moaning!
Ya so fine I got to give it to you

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 3]
I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning
Do you like caressing or do you like aggression?
You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows
Do you want it in the dark or while the lights is still on?
I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel
While we sweating you dripping wet from what your body spill
Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go
See baby lately seems my life been hell and heaven knows
That you looking like an angel-sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle
Got a nigga tangle in your spider web
I'm doing shit I never might of did
And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red
Your body's right as rain
So where the hydroplane
That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame
Thank God I found you
Just holla when you want it
Cause girl your so thorough[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', "Who was that?"
"Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?"
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine, and

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin', yeahYeah
Still at it
Villematic
What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hellbound
With these flows, Cole
And when my story's told
Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow
So, I'm coming for what I'm owed
You know?[Produced by J. Cole]

Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be, happy

Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna beCan someone please turn off my mind?
My thoughts are racing all the time
There is no reason or no rhyme
I'm trapped inside myself

A newborn baby has two primary modes of communication
Laughter, which says, "I love this"
Or crying, which says, "This frightens me, I'm in pain"
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

At the bottom of the hourglass
Lies sand that represents the past
In which all of my demons rest
I'm calling out for help

There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the story of a young man who left everyone and everything he loved to chase his dream. A lil' nigga from North Carolina, Fayetnam to be exact. Packed up all his shit and moved to the big city of dreams, where he ain't know a motherfuckin' soul, and he ain't have a motherfuckin' thing, just a dollar and a dream.

This mixtape is provided partly in part by, Dreamville Records. Straight out the Ville where anything's possible. All-terrain music, that's Carolina's finest boy. And by any means, when ain't shit handed to you, you gotta take it. Without further ado ladies and gentlemen I proudly present to you, J. Cole, The Come Up.[Intro: J. Cole]
"Yeah, you ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith in all that
But sometimes
Sometimes, you second guess yourself
That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it?
Warm up."[Intro]
Yeah, The Warm Up
Lemme stretch out
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They say I'm the down south Nas, the east coast Pac
The Carolina Andre, the Fayettenam Kanye
So join it, can't beat it, to all the nonbelievers
If you missed it, I'll repeat it, I'm the light skinned Jesus
Here's my thesis for them niggas with them pieces like Reese's
We ballin' while we winking at your bitch up in the bleachers
She fiending just to hop up on my shit like she was featured
On that piece of shit, bed keep on squeaking like some sneakers
On the court, here's some lines you can snort, food for thought
Here's a fork, no pork, damn it, keep it pure, organic
What's the score? Lord, it's a blowout
You niggas out here shoutin', but see me, I'm just gon' show out
Bitch, it's destiny, no doubt, niggas testing me more but I'm sure
Look homie I know my shit can give a tour of the sewer
I'm bored, this shit is simple, on instrumentals I'm Kimbo
Slicing on any tempo, I'm busting like many pimples on the temple
Go hard like I just seen some nipples on Beyonce
No disrespect to Hov, but if I didn't I'd be beyond gay
Almost erased them lines but in the end I chose to keep 'em
'Cause if I said it, I really, I really
I really mean it, yeah

[Interlude]
And that's just a Warm Up baby
Lemme give it to 'em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, nigga

[Verse 2]
I rep my city in your city
Just to let you niggas know just where I'm comin from
Ville' nigga troublesome
Gats all around niggas waist like a cummerbund
Leave you leakin' 'til the plumber come
Still we ain't running from no man
Look bitch I'm hot enough to melt a snowman
Ey pack your bags mama we gettin the fuck up outta Po' land
Cause I'm programmed for the dough
While you hold hands with a ho
You ain't got no chance when I flow
Bitch I was a grown man when I was four
Boy, so sit your ass down
You lookin at the class clown
Slash valedictorian, slash hoopin nigga best dressed
Back in school you was just a stupid nigga
And now you're rappin all you talk bout your Coupe is sicker
Your top is dropped but the cops is out here shootin niggas
Stupid nigga, see me I rather tell the truth to niggas
You out here stuntin, niggas is out here frontin
Nigga you good for nothin
I'm freestylin coming off the dome
Bitch Macaulay Culkin Home Alone
I don't even know why I said that
And bitch I get bread that's enormous
Ya'll niggas on my dick man I'm dormant
That means I'm on the low, that means I'm on your ho
That means I'm about this dough
Nigga I'm coming off the dome
Bitch I'm I'll all the way to the chromosomes in my body
Bitch get hit with a 12-gauge shotty
No Maserati, driving like Mr Cosby
Nigga know
I'm coming through I got the sicker flow
I've hit them motherfuckin niggas with that
Nigga know that drunk shit I'll shit
Comin through I spill shit like whoops, bitch
You need to read a book bitch

(Fade Out with J. Cole still rapping)[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Art of seduction, hoes jump like Vince Carter
Backstage like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams, you gotta start off with something
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustling
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said "Your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin' on
Funny 'cause I only know a couple of your songs but I love when they come on"
Word?

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted
[mumbling]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?

[Verse 2]
That's a little ego—
Tistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G 'cause he know
Bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass
Into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich, huh
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick, huh
She thinking she got a first round pick, huh
She thinking 'bout all the things she can get, huh
She thinking you got a Range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple 'cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches
And they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word
Wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs
Aye

[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted
[mumbling]
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?[Hook]
Uh, yeah
I said it won’t be long (no)
‘fore we out here baby
Gotta get you up out here baby
Said it won’t be long
‘fore we out here baby
We up out here baby

[J. Cole Verse 1]
I say a prayer and look up in the sky
Thank God even though a nigga headed to this tired day job
Will my eyes stay wide still I know I’m gonna blow
This is music for my niggas cause I know you want more
Cause that old shit fake but this new shit real
J. Cole not Jay but this that Blueprint feel
Hey Cole is you crazy that's some big boots to fill
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well
Seen heaven, seen hell, seen niggas get killed
Knew every detail still never would tell
Scared of the repercussion, scared of them people bussin'
Bullets be hittin’ nigga’s you swear they could be percussion
Niggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing
No law, but became a man on my own
Showed my momma I could stand on my own

[Hook]

[J. Cole Verse 2]
Dear mama, your son hurting
Living in this cold World where niggas shun virgins
And praise hoes
As days go by shawty 19 years old
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly
Tell me why mamma do you cry
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise
Mamma I know it hurts
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him
So whats the options for him
A young nigga from the hood without a pops at home
Surrounded by no good
And soon no good becomes so good quick
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich
Killing your hood with the same shit Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with
And it’s still in your hood shit
I’m feeling no good mamma
I’m sick of my soul
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope
I just hope and I pray
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way
And mamma I can fly you out this cold world
This cold life, it’s all wrong
There’s no right
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light
Just grab onto me, trust me hold tight!

[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then you aim too low

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God (Cole the God, Cole the God)

Fayetteville, North Carolina
*Crowd cheers*
2, 6, make some motherfuckin' noise one time tonight, God damn it! Bring all the lights so I could see all these motherfuckers one time. Ayy, this shit's crazy. Ayy, this shit crazy. All the way in the back, wassup, we see y'all niggas in the back, wassup? Left side, wassup, we see y'all niggas, man. Right side, what's poppin', God damn it! Ayy, yo, you know we see this shit down here, this shit lit, this shit lit. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself. I go by the name of J. Cole, Cole fucking World, and I'm from the Ville. A few months back, I dropped this album, it's called 2014 Forest Hills Drive, I don't know if people heard about that shit. They tryna say, they tryna say it's the first album to go platinum without no fuckin' features and shit. They say that, they say that, I ain't say that, they said that, but since they said that, since they said that. Fayetteville, if it's good with y'all, and only if it's cool with y'all, I'm tryna perform the whole fuckin' album if it's cool with you. Can I do that shit on some Ville shit? Ok then, on some Ville shit, ok then. But y'all know this whole album is a journey, from front to back, this is a journey. Before we get too far into the fucking journey, I wanna press rewind and take you to a time where I was just a young fuckin' boy[Intro]
"That was the warm up, that was the warm up, baby
Aight, Elite, for real, one take, dawg, and I'm up outta here
One, yup, yeah."

[Verse]
Lord, please forgive me for my sinning
I ain’t saying that I’m finished, but I’m praying in advance
Cause the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yeah, ball game
I swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans when a nigga took the chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like Bobby had Whitney, we was cooking up crack
But them fifteen credits had a nigga off track
Picture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
But mastered this rap shit
You hear the words coming from my lips bastards
I never crack, I got that Chapstick
I practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where’s the ladder?
Cause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that
No Soprano, half black, half white; I’m a piano
I’m an animal, my video on Discovery Channel
I’m a beast when my shit hits the streets, these niggas cease to exist
Like a beach in a tsunami,  you'll find me in the ‘Ville
In the state of NC
Bitch, if I ain’t back home, I’m up in NYC
‘Bout that money prob-ly like a fucking robbery
But I ain’t jacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
Hey, take a hard look at my drive nigga, no hacking on my shit
I’m straight smacking niggas, straight tagging niggas
Yo, I freestyle and fuck you niggas, ya’ll be wilding and I’m out[Intro]
Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Get paid a pretty Penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"
With the flick of the pen, write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil Maine is the best mc out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters

[Pre-Hook]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 2]
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke"
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga 'cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto

[Pre-Hook]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place
In that PJ Rosé, I drink that shit by the case
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win
Street life will have you drunk, I'm talkin Seagram’s Gin
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life and Times
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart
Life is staged, I just played my part
Haha, yeah

[Hook]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Bridge]
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Verse 2]
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

[Outro]
They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind[Verse 1]
Drama is a must
Kinda like a condom when I buss
I'm rotten but I'm polished
I'm a diamond in the rough
From North Cacs
Never could I come off whack
Some of y'all cats is pussys I ain't hung off that
Call your squad get every nigga off the block
Call the cops the SWAT team
All to stop me
I cock these
Y'all niggas is frost cuz you talk a lot
But never strap like a halter top
Y'all are not gangters for God's sake cool it
'For you snooze and pick the wrong nigga to fool with
An you get introduced to two fists, Timbaland boots are mint
And beat to death with a pool stick
I'm through with jokes
I'm through with stupid folks that say they get hanged
Whats the use its hopeless
You fools is smokin
Me loosing focus
It's like a mother fucker drinking juice and chocking
My mood is upset
Your crew is suspect
My unit is some niggas I dare you to fuck with
Plus, I'm the illest as soon as I feel it hittin
You can't fight the feeling revealing mi killah instinct

[Hook]
I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
You willing to die, No
That's why we all gotta live a killer inside yo
Whether it's a tool or I use a knife
If the mood is right concludes your life
I'm bruisin
N I'll take it to any nigga to doubt that
This killa be killed and I ain't even out yet

[Verse 2]
The bigger they come the harder they drop
I give it all that I got
My money couldn't find another artist to rock
Harder I'm cock
Diesel i'm nice
Move like a theif in the night
Sickest Mo'fucker to ever breath on the mic
Is here in the flesh
Sincere when I swear I'm the best
Niggas ain't tryna hear it unless you do it correct
Never losing a step
Never losing respect
You act stupid and step I'll introduce you to death
I'm losing my head
A few screw lose in my neck
I'm not stable
I came real y'all drop fakers
You not able to hang one around your finish
I never draw the line unless you're surrounded in it
Watered down niggas drownin in it
But surrounded by angus
Niggas hold me down and menace
Crash you this major don't take offence please
Blaming your face is a basic instinct

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You [?]some shit fucked
Cuz every word I utter is intent you faggot
Fukin with this is like punching cement
I know your type you bluffin with tough talk
You scared to brawl
Never steppin but your mind is running marathons
It's hopeless, I'm focussed, I won't miss
Any fool wanna oppose get your throat slit
You can't call it I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learn from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit
Throw fists even if your voice is deep
Niggas suffer from arthritis their joints is weak
North Cacs where the mo'fuckin turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo Funny how tables turn in life
Pay your dues earn your stripes
Never be concerned with ice
Cuz check it out
The more money you pay for it
It's just giving even me more reasons to take this shit
The main event, serving niggas
The way y'all run through these herds with these words is disturbing niggas
So leave it alone
I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
Don't need to play games, I'm in a league of my own
It's Therapist niggas
Dismiss you dick kisses
For you to get bigger your shit is slimmer than stick figures
Faggots can't stand how much love I get
But if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm takin over
I got what it takes to make it over the top
You tryna test me then stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feelin the most
Stepped off stage got arrested for stealing the show
Mother fucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah cuz I ain't going out yet, Mo'fucka
It's Therapist I got the killah instinct
Nervous Reck he got the killah instict
F[?] Rich he got the killah instinct
The whole fucking Crash room they got the killah instinct
My man All Mighty he got the killah instinct
My man Dialect he got the killah instinct
The nigga Volatile he got the killah instinct
Omen and Elite them niggas got the killah instinct
It's killah instinct[Verse 1]
Momma, I just killed a man
My body still trembling, can you feel my hand?
Don’t shed no tears, it won’t be long before they find out it was me, momma
This may be the last time you see me free, ma, don't spend it crying
You did your best, me, I was blessed, know you were stressed trying
To keep me out the streets, me, ducking police
Trying not to make a peep to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skipping class, flunking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehow I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right, but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you 'shamed of me?
Dry your face, mommy, you're not to blame for me
See, I’m a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder ’bout my father, would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running 'round with the lowlifes?
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas kill for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga momma
But what’s done is done
I’m on the run, I live my life like a movie now it’s way too realer
Who would've thought your baby boy would've grew up to be a killer?

[Chorus]
Yeah, now I’m a killer
Guess I’m a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah, I mean the killers

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"I mean—murderers! Do you hear me? Real live murderers!
I thought black people killed people by accident!
Nah, these motherfuckers was murderers."

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Yeah, I wonder what's in store for me, lately been stressing
Pray for blessings, hope that there’s more for me than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot, worked on the gunshot
Who woulda thought? I used to block this nigga's lay-ups
Now he’s in a cell layed up, I wish you well, stay up
Like insomniacs, this life can make a
Nigga fold like a laundry mat, I sip this cognac, though
To ease my brain from all this pain and so that I react slow
In this fast world, slow niggas, fast girls
Ho's give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on ‘em, hold up that old checker flag for ‘em
Chalk lines by the do not park sign, it’s deep
All these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I’d rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell ‘em now boy, don’t make me turn into a killer, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, into a killer
Don’t make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeah yeah

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"Triple life... How do you do triple life?
That mean if he die and come back... He gotta go to penitentiary!
Right there, he said "Fuck kindergarten. Get your little ass on in the penitentiary, motherfucker. You know what you did last time."

[Verse 3]
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda ever thought that time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day, swore that we would make the league and be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, aw shit
Watch how they pile up, seem like a mile up
I washed the blisters on my hands and then I'd dial up
My best friend, skating rink is where we headed at night
And if a nigga disrespect, oh yes, we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seem petty, at the time the shit was heavy
'Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas got their brains blowed out
Snatch a niggas chain and he got his name wrote out
In obituaries, another body in a cemetery
Another young nigga in the penitentiary
And he don’t give a fuck: no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture, nigga: Pictionary
Tell you what it is, I’m a dictionary
I knew a nigga threw his dick in e'ry chick in e'ry
City that he went to, went hard like the rent due
'Til he met the wrong bitch, man, just came
Home ex-convict, and he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers

[Outro]
Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I’m a killer[Intro: J. Cole]
Yea
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that due to body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea[Intro]
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, hey
And on the count of three, Blow up, Blow up

[Verse]
Yeah, and that I will, nigga, that I will
I keep a checklist of rappers that I'mma kill
I used to play the bleachers before I had a deal
Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel
Hmm, ill, fantastic
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga, "Jam"nastics
Your style hot now, but they just can't last with
Something like the rap sand-castle
Gone with the tide, I'm here for the seasons
Bend yo' ass over bitch I'm here for a reason
Cold breezin', flow freezin'
This ain't spittin' ho, I'm sneezin'
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them Lowes doors, is what I throw keys in
Man, talk about a come up
Niggas see me in the street they talk about 'The Come Up'
Or talk about 'The Warm Up'
Or "Nigga, when your album drop?"
And why these lil' rappers like to run their mouth alot?
And J. Cole, are you really from the south or not?
I see your jeans, man them thangs, must have cost a lot
Aye do you get a chance to hang out with the boss a lot?
Even them hating niggas like you at the barbershop
Cole.. Yeah, that's my muhfucking name
Nigga couldn't even watch the All Star game
Had to do the whole Valentines Day thang
Gotta play the game, so my lady won't complain
Three or four days, I be back on a plane
Do a couple shows, where the people know my name
Look man, the crowd full of pretty young dames
If you gonna do dirt, then you can't leave a stain, man!
Tiger Woods y'all
He like them white girls, I like them hoods y'all
She got her head straight, she got a good job
She give the best brain, she got them good jaw
I got that good game, that's cause I'm good, y'all
And J. Cole the lil' engine that could, y'all
And yeah I'm coming for the top, like I should, y'all
And bitch I never fall off, knock on wood, y'all
Cole[Intro]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip

[Verse 1]
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick

[Verse 2]
How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick

[Outro]
Power, greed
Money, Molly, weed
Percs, Xannys, lean, fame
And the strongest drug of them all
And the strongest drug of them all
Love[Intro]
Yeah, hey, look

[Verse 1]
When she talk she so closed-minded
All she wanna do is shop, she so clothes minded
Wanna cop the latest 'fore them other hoes find it
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it
Probably 'cause she so fine it'll blow your mind
She black and Pocahontas, laid back and blow that chronic
Ass so fat, wanna tat my logo on it
So any other nigga that a tap will know it's mine
I put in work overtime
Let me cut, mow the lawn, guarantee I blow your mind
She tried to play me 'til she learned I wrote a rhyme
"That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, oh girl, that boy the bomb
No chain around his neck, but better watch out for the charm"
You're not my daughter, um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies

[Chorus: J. Cole & Lee Fields (Sampled)]
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
Beautiful ladies, yeah
Now I ain't tricking, but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
Ladies, yeah
Now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
All you ladies, yeah
Now if you from the suburbs or the hood (Yeah, ayy, look)
Beautiful ladies

[Verse 2]
She said "I got a man", well, baby I don't give a fuck
See me I understand, and I ain't tryna split you up
Okay, give me your number and later I'ma hit you up
If you sleep I get you up, ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up, yeah, do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my t-shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on, come hop up on this ski jet
You scared of that water or you just scared to get your weave wet?
Barely got your feet wet, yes, I know where we headed
Tryna see you throw it back, let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for
You could be my cuddy buddy, baby, what are friends for?
I speed up the tempo, them other niggas lazy
Can't fuck with nuttin' younger than the eighties
I'm grown and I'm looking for some ladies, ladies, yeah

[Chorus: J. Cole & Lee Fields (Sampled)]
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
Beautiful ladies, yeah
Now I ain't tricking, but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
Ladies, yeah
Now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
All you ladies, yeah
Now if you from the suburbs or the hood (Yeah, ayy, look)
Beautiful ladies

[Outro: Lee Fields & Ladies]
Hey girl, what's your name?
Oh wow, you look so nice
I know you man is satisfied
Ayy, young lady, what's your name?
Oh wow, I know your man is pleased
All the way down to his knees
And what's your name?
Tell me, I know yo man is worried
About where you are tonight, huh
Well ladies, all you ladies
All over the world
I want you to help me sing this, here we go
Ladies
Beautiful ladies
Oh

Beautiful ladies[Intro]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me, bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother room
Like, "Man, I might as well be sleeping in my mother room"
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair, this is so pure
This is so clear, this is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President, you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here, nigga, I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast, yeah
Avoiding the snakes, AKs, and coke, yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man, I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city
Of New York nine years, ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop, drop)

[Verse 2]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn, he turned out to be a genius
Damn, real shit nigga, no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Interlude]
Make, hey, make that ass drop (drop)
Hey, you seen me in this every damn day (drop)
It got the dick hard as a rock (drop)
And I can't control (Let it rock)
Hehe, control

[Verse 3]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with...
Yeah, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with...
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative
Nigga is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call
She was hurting, now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

[Outro]
Hm, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with[Intro]
La-la-la-laaaa, la lala la lalaaaa

[Chorus]
Now I am (Here's to the Roc')
Hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
(Here's to Roc-a-Fella) It's the Fayettenam
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc')
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up

[Verse 1]
Now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am

[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Verse 2]
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map

[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Outro]
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts."
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name."
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him."
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Dear Mrs Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job, don't mean to disrespect ya
But we been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby
(Yeah, if you only knew) I got bigger problems baby
Hey
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothing to me
'Cause right now I got my little boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me, listen here
I ain't looking for no tears but my brother got a year
And my mother keep smoking that shit
On top of that I'm broke, please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then I holla

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me
I need to be left
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Mr Policeman
Ayy, am I wrong or ain't you supposed to keep the peace man
I could have swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh no I get it I get it I get it
Or 'cause I'm black? Hmm maybe
Yeah hey tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound
Man i'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frowned on me
With your flashlight tell me what do you see
Thug niggas drug dealers it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mother fucking college degree

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'ma fuckin try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, man, we don't make the news
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods "be fuckin all these white hoes"
Anchorman stop snitchin
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?
Are you perfect motherfucker, how you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I just can’t take this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me alone
I need to be left alone
And if I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone[Produced by J. Cole & Nate Jones]

[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

[Hook]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

[Hook]
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 3]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

[Hook]
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin5 years ago, we started a journey together. On June 15th, 2009 I released The Warm Up to a few who were waiting patiently for it. Full of my dreams, fears and predictions, it resonated with you right away. Over the next year I watched it grow legs and spread at an unbelievable pace all because you felt it so much. Five years later, I couldn’t be more proud of it’s impact. Thank you.

The Warm Up is a declaration of dedication to Greatness. Told from the perspective of a kid who wants more than what his city has to offer him. The crime. The stagnation. He wants more from the girls he dates. He wants out of Muhammad’s house. He refuses to let anyone tell him he can’t dream. That he won’t make it. He believes in himself. He dedicates his life to his craft, because he’s finally realized that the work that you put in today has a direct and absolute impact on the life you live tomorrow.

You heard the passion, you heard the stories, and you believed in him too. You rooted for him. And your’e still rooting. My thoughts today come from my observations over the past 5 years. I understand now that you’re rooting for him, rooting for me, because you are also rooting for yourself. You realize that this society kills dreams and encourages you to conform. To settle for the block, to join the army, to become a lawyer when you really want to paint, to get comfortable in the projects, to slave away at a 9-5 you hate because it pays decent; to become complacent with safety. The Warm Up says, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”

I think about all the times over the past few years that one of you has said to me, “you’re the reason I went to college,” “yo, The Warm Up got me through some hard times,” “got me through law school,” “med school,” “high school,” “The Warm Up changed my life.”

I imagine that 5 years ago we all wanted more. The Warm Up was just something that put music and words to what we were feeling. As I write this I’m on a plane from Sydney, Australia back to New York City. Music has taken me around the world now, doing shows in places I never thought I would be. I’m grateful.

I’m wondering where you are today. 5 years later. The Warm Up dropped when some of you were upperclassmen in college. I’m hoping that you’ve found a career doing some shit you love, something that makes you happy. Maybe you needed more time to figure it out. Grad School? Or maybe you’re back in your parents crib trying to regroup. Everything will be OK. Don’t stop dreaming.

Some of ya’ll were still in high school. If you went on to college, enjoy it while you got it. If you went straight to the real world, I wish you the best. I hope you found a trade you love, or a job that allows you to support yourself. Happiness is all that matters. If you ain’t happy, adjust please.

Some of you were underclassmen in college, which means you probably just entered the workforce or you’re still trying to get that entry level position. These are the toughest times. You will struggle no doubt, but it will all work out in the end.

No matter where you were 5 years ago, I hope that today you are closer to your dreams. I know that everything hasn’t gone exactly the way you planned, it hasn’t for me either. But our job isn’t to plan. Our job includes 3 responsibilities. 1. To dream. 2. To believe that dream is attainable. And 3. To work hard everyday towards that dream. Let God handle the rest.

As you go throughout this week replaying this project that changed my life and lots of yours too, I want to leave you with this because I feel we all need it. Read this as if these words were yours, because they are.

In 5 years I have come so far. I am grateful to be here today, alive and full of potential. But I am not satisfied. I still want more. I still have dreams, even bigger now than before. I will not settle or conform. I rededicate myself to greatness. I give my time and my passion to my craft, because I realize that the work I put in today affects the life that I live tomorrow. I believe in myself. And to all those that doubt me I say, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”

Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life's a bitch, the type of chick who likes to kiss and tell
I'd like to switch this life, I'm talking to the wishing well
Tired of missions failed
Why do they wish us well?
Know when they wish us L's
This is hell, but i won't cry like little girls
No, I just keep on dreamin' on
Got a plot to be the greatest, it's the top I'm scheming on
Like a doctor, I got patience, I know it won't be that long
So when all your voices gone, man, I'll still be singing on
(Like)
Say I'm a loser, OK, what, cause i'm losing one round?
Oh, now I'm losing my way? Cause my reviews are thumbs down?
I pay no mind, cause I know time is life's windex
So in due time, you'll see clearly just who gon' raise that index
Finger, Let's see who falls like Jenga
Who gets the glory, boy meets world, let's see who gets Topenga
Man, when you losing nobody gon' talk to you like strangers
Look mama, I made it, won't you know it
Everybody speak my language, yeah, yeah[Verse 1]
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please

[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"

[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, turn off the lights
Lights, please

[Outro]
Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's "Dead Presidents", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like "yo". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like "Yo", like, "Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come, hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again. Just almost like, just to prove to that nigga and kinda prove to myself that you I can, I can maybe get a little...[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the life of a nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I'm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I'm fly, I'm a Wright Brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that you could cut and never worry 'bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorized her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her
Y'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don't be appalled man, that nigga was a dog
So it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do that make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Post-Chorus]
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 2]
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it's time to hit the real world, filled with all them résumés and applications
Man, but ain't nobody calling you back
You say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the world on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
'Ey has this world got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had the brake on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, it's just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ain't changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you you'll get the same me

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Post-Chorus]
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 3]
Just like a star that's in my sky
Just like an angel off my page
You have appeard to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and it's been, way too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Hey, uh, still I wonder why
But it ain't what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goin' out my mind
Man, damn

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star[Intro]
Yeah, uh
Uh, yea
Yea, uh
Fayettenam, nigga
Hahaah uh
Carolina, nigga
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Uh, uh, uh
Nothing but sweat, tears
Just another perspective
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play where killers hung at and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that get gun clap for sneakers
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Who am I trusting?
No time to think about illegal when your stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busting
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
Cause, uh, it wasn't set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)

[Hook]
The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it gets better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)

[Verse 2]
Yea, uh
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto bird circling
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursing them, (fuck)
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We young, black, some strapped
Them whites got they lunch pack for school, we had our guns packed
And all a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
You kill a nigga over beef and cheddar even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest soon
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas still cursin em
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!

[Hook]
The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it get better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse]
Yeah, ain’t nuttin' to it but to do it, nigga that's true
A quarter milli and a Buick, nigga guess who?
It came to me like the dream that I once had
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you
Clearly, now hear me
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly[Verse 1]
Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hoping this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell them "go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let them OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it

Losing your balance, yea uh

Don't lose your balance
Don't lose your balance

[Verse 2]
I look around at my city, this is SinVille
That boy eleven-years-old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul I asked it "When will, this shit change? "
It said boy "Just use them pen skills"
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh

[Hook]
Yeah, and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance
Don't slip don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
Don't lose your balance
Don't lose your balance

I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'mma sucka for love I guess
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame em' did the same when I saw the ass
Match with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped

[Hook]
I think I'm losing my balance, yea uh
I think I'm losing my balance, yea uh

Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?
Uh

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life—is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit
 You ain't shit, nigga!"

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion (Uh)
But what about your seed, nigga? (Uh-uh)
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?

Got a young chick from the hood, south side
Pops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit she was up against
Little did he know the shit was going to back fire
‘Cause she act quiet, got baptized, sang in the choir
But the thing she desired was a
Older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girl is in heat, it’s deep
She sneaking out, off the leash
On the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out, he kicked her out
She living on her own and it’s vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room
And I’m thinking of the best way to kick her out

[Hook]
‘Cause all she ever talks about is Louie, Louie
All she ever talks about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can’t fuck with her no more
I mean Louie, Louie, all she ever talk about is Louie, Louie
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can’t fuck with her no more

[Verse 2]
I told the bitch somebody stole my Rollie
She talking ‘bout “me too”
I came through with the brand new Louis bag
She talking ‘bout “me too”
LA on my next flight, you guess right, she said “me too”
Now everybody gonna Ms. Me Too
Goddamn, be you
And if that is you, you so shallow
You on a boat that won’t travel
Won’t float and won’t paddle
If I go broke it won’t matter
This stupid ass shit don’t make me

You so caught up on material shit
We both know that you can’t even get

[Verse 3]
Dude got a rich bitch, though
She off the chain, ready to go
Baddest thing, head to toe
Fine line between a rock star and just a ho
But she walked that
Goddamn, girl, she walked that
Big money talk real loud
I mean I can barely talk back
But I, but I got good game, good game
Nothing like them lames you used to
I know the rules gon’ use you
I just want the same shit that you do
Can you keep a secret?
Sometimes, man, your beeper leak it

I danced with the devil then, please believe it
Please believe it

Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’mma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit remember I was straying from home
And "Where I Wanna Be" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone

If shit was on the other foot then you would leave my ass
Ay, True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal and you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try justify thinkin', man we finna be rich
While some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks

Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

Ion think y'all really understand how... as I really started to take a closer look at all that shit we want, and all the shit we need that makes us happy, I started to see for my, with my own eyes. Like wait a minute. That shit don’t feel right, that shit feel weird. And I started to notice that, all of that shit that they tried to tell us is all bullshit and it's all wrong and it's not what we need to make us happy. I had to go figure that shit out on my own. It’s a man right now, he got millions of fucking dollars, he got a billion dollars. He got everything that we think we need to be happy, he got it. He got money, he got the cars, he got the big ass crib, 3 or 4 of them bitches, he got the genetically impossible wife, and he got bitches. But yet, this dude is fucking miserable, he's empty inside. But you got a family, that comes from where we come from, from this city right here, worse conditions than what we come from. They couldn't afford to a ticket to this show tonight if they fucking wanted one. But yet somehow, they got more happiness and joy in their life than this man will ever have in his fucking life. How is that possible? Love

Maine on fire, my empire be higher
Than an octave on Mariah, you niggas should worship sire
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars
I was David promising the world that I'mma serve Goliath
Then I swam with sharks, made it to the land and parked
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as satan's worst desires
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo
Get my head out the window
20k in my pocket as im feeling the wind blow
And I ain't have a wallet since Nintendo, comprendo
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo
I used to wanna save the world, now all I do is spend dough
Till I snap back like Hov hat
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that

[Hook]
Maine on fire
Top down bitch i ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Maine on fire
Every week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots many bottles pop
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

[Verse 2]
We collect a hundred thou
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now
I was such a cunning child
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you
The one your mama glad you hung around
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor, nigga
But its just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas
We just let the paper blind us
While vaginas chase behind us
Take notes make money don't make jokes
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats
Real shit but if the world really bout to end
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again

Huh

[Hook][Verse 1: Therapist]
Yo you up on some shit fuck
Cuz every word I utter's intent you faggot
Fucking with this is like punching cement
I know your type, you bluffing with tough talk you scared to brawl
Never stepping but your mouth is running marathons
Its hopeless, I'm focused, I won't miss
Any foes want to oppose get your throats slit
You can't call it, I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learnt from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit (get it? Damn)
Know this even if your voice is deep
Niggas sufferin' from arthritis they joints is weak
Know if cats know where the motherfuckin' turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo funny how tables turn and life pays your dues
Earn your stripes, never be concerned with ice cuz check it out
The more money you pay for rent, is just givin' me even more reason to take this shit
The main event, servin' niggas the way y'all run through these herds with these words is distrubin' niggas
So leave it alone, I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
No need to play games I'm in a league of my own
Its therapist niggas, dismiss you dick kissers, for you to get bigger than shits slimmer than stick figures
You faggots can't stand how much love I get, but if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm taking over, I got what it takes to make it over the top you trynna diss me to stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feeling the most stepped on stage got arrested for stealing the show mothafucka

Boy, I'm already paid, getting money for the fuck of it

So if you fly, what am I, do that make me the mothership?
Beam me up ho, they wanna see a nigga down
Take his crown, we be up doe, yeah we be up ho!
Now hit the ground, bow down to the sound
Good God

I guess they know that I'll cut a ho
Yeah I cleaned up good but I'm still out the gutter though
Don't forget this shit
You gotta problem? Then meet me outside if you with the shit
I've seen where the players sit
A couple racks gone just to see 'Bron hit the layup, shit
I be on some nigga shit
But bitch, I'm way past nigga rich
Good God

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way

[Verse 3]
Cole World, used to stay off his dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old-ass Laker
But I ain't come to talk about all that paper
That's what they talk about when they ain't got shit to say
Can't understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know they sayin' same shit, nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cuz on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows, hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish n' chips
Why I do a lot of shows, I'm the shit that's it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes, word to Cliff and Chris
If I fuck six bitches I got six assists

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way

That new Rihanna shit bump
That new Rihanna shit bump[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Outro]
Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real[Verse]
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind
A savage over this cabbage
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (No)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs
I'm on my grind, yo, bonafide honcho
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds
Matter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick
Survival's a bitch
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0
God knows I don't put up no facade, no
No fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob
Keep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh
From the other side, punk-ass nigga
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk
Blast pop while I pump gas
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath
My niggas will ride all day like a fun pass
That's some New York shit, I'm from the south, though
Don't never disrespect me out yo mouth, ho
I got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
"And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country!"
Excuse me

[Verse 1]
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

[Post-Chorus]
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Verse 2]
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'ma pass your classes, I'ma learn your craft
I'ma fuck your daughters, I'ma burn your flag

[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments

Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Outro]
They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio[Intro: J. Cole]
Sometimes you rip straight through
(I told you how we was gon’ do it)
And sometimes you just love rappin’ this shit so much you just
(Drama I told you how we was gon’ do it)
You just like “fuck it” let me get that shit again
God, please forgive us

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis, he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit

Moving careless as shit

Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where the scarecrows at
No brains on them niggas but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam, I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag
Beware of the days when the first go last
And the last go first, damn the past sure hurt
That’s why I hit the Henny in this flask
With my foot pressed heavy on this gas
Life is like a Brillo pad
Sometimes I sit and wish I had the life that Willow had
Said I walk around mad ‘cause I never see my dad
And you wonder why my motherfuckin’ brother’s so bad
And I was in the third grade first time I skipped class
Whoa!
Switch topics, look, my bitch tropic
Stack so thick to fit need six pockets
Smash whole cliques, so sick I get nauseous
Quick as pickpockets, slick like Rick Fox’s hair
Diamond chain, yeah the Roc is here
You lean back like a rocking chair
You niggas not prepared, no preparation
This is dedication
Slit your fuckin’ throat and blame it on my medication
Illuminati meeting, showed up late and met a Mason
Who saw me and assured me that there was no better nation
For, crooks and thieves, looks deceive
They throw The Book at niggas with no books to read
See, there I go, every time I try to stunt
Can’t help but kick the real shit
Man, why I even front?
Maybe ‘cause that’s all you little niggas ever want
But I’mma change the game
See you in a couple months, boy

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Hopefully this here shows y’all somethin’
Dedication
What’s ours, and what’s yours
You see the playing field was never really that even
We just let you play the game but you dropped the ball
Cole World
Born sinner
All the way
Drama
You’re welcome[Verse]
Mo Money, yeah
Mo Money, Blow Money, Show Money
Party Money, Side Ho Money, Dope Money
New Clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with petroleum and coal money
Probably kill they selves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Pop off, robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga get your money"[Intro]
You really wanna know who Superman is?
Watch this, pow!
I like him
I think he's pretty cool
He's my idol

[Verse 1]
I can't have no sympathy for fuck niggas
All this shit I've seen done made my blood thicker
Spill promethazine inside a double cup
Double up my cream, now that's a Double Stuff, yeah
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout no commas
Keep the peace like Dalai Lama, big body Hummers
Backin' out the parkin' spot and though the law be on him
He exempt, Shawn Kemp, he keep that .40 on him
Go!

[Chorus]
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)

[Refrain]
Too many times I swallowed my pride
(Get money)
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I'm poppin' a pill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm

[Verse 2]
Woah, suddenly, I feel like takin' a PJ
(Get money)
Fly to D.R. on a weekday, eatin' ceviche
With like half of a mili' inside of my briefcase
A couple of freaks play
And they don't speak inglés
But the money is somethin' that they could comprende
And I got bread like I'm Green Day
(Get money)
I come around and their heads turn
Used to like bitches with hair permed
Now I like it "natural, actual, factual"
Naps and shit, bougie, still do ratchet shit
Not afraid to pass the clip
Before I make the ratchet spit, blaow!

[Chorus]
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)

Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money

Too many times I swallowed my pride

I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I'm poppin' a pill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive

[Outro]
Get money
Get money[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey... huh, Cole World
Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, everybody got a bad side, drop, let me see that shit
What you say? "Cole ain't hot," what?
Where you read that shit? You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?
Have you seen my shows? Have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot, would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting that, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me, boy, I'm red hot, aw, nigga, they not
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere they not (I said)
You'll never play me, nice try, balling in a nice spot
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot
So, you can look, but don't touch
I stay on my toes like the White Sox, cause

[Hook: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high-roller
Now it's racks on racks, never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?
Young, black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas Eve
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench
Now wonder why I didn't quit the team, but
I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World 'til the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please, I gotta make history

[Hook: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no, you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I got a Hublot, I call it Tebow
I strap that bitch with a gator band
Y'all niggas ball half-time, y'all niggas like the Gator band
Y'all niggas need a time out
Who got these niggas all wound up?
Cocksucker, I'm 730
Y'all know where y'all niggas gonna wind up?
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit yall niggas with a nice shot
Y'all niggas better not call the law
Get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning y'all better not waste my time
When y'all ready I take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors
Put the front on the back, cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'Bach like a boss
So I'm fronting on niggas when I'm backing off
What up, Cole? It's your time, let's these niggas know
Adjust your Rollie on these motherfucking hoes
Whenever you ready, go

[Outro: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
(Ugh, nice watch)There's gold at stake for Golden State
How much weight can King's shoulders take
When the odds ain't great some fold and break
While greats let the dreams of a ring motivate
Boys become men when postseasons begin
These lights shine brighter baby, sink or you swim
To those who got here by the skin of they teeth
The formula's the same now; win and repeat
Never sleep on a man that's expected to lose
With a chip on his shoulder and something to prove
The bottom's full of Wolves and they thirsty for blood
The mission is to catch somebody slipping above
"But numbers don't lie", I've heard 'em say it at times
"Cream rises to the top", is a favorite of mine
And the cream of this crop you'll admit is impressive
But to quote the boy Hov, "Gotta finish your breakfast"
And watch for the quiet ones, they bringin' the storm
Even with a man down, "The show must go on"
No time for crying, better pick up the slack
Cause ain't no guarantee that you gon' ever be back[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, what's good baby?
Shit, I ain't seen you in a minute
Now you wanna' hit me

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Shawty I'mma tell you something you don't wanna' hear(yeah), hear(yeah), hear(yeah)
You threw a nigga to the curb
I fronted like I didn't even care(yeah), care(yeah), care(yeah)
But deep down
I needed your umbrella couldn't make it through the rain(yep), rain(yep), rain(Yep)
So I been fuckin' everthing in this town trying to run from the pain, pain, pain
And now suddenly you say you wanna chat, but what is that?
You feel like Kobe, like I'm Shaq
Look how you need a nigga back
Ironic
You burned my heart up like some chronic
Now you say you want it once mo' but what fo'
You did me dirty like some must
So shit why would I?
Plus my niggas know you played me so how could I?
Nah fuck trynna look cool I ain't nobody's fool
I sang the blues for like four months
Now you wanna show up?
You saying that you feenin' for me screaming to me
Boy I need you bad

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
Boy I need you bad as my heart beat (Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breathe (Baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain (Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm about to go insane (Baby I need you bad)
I need you(I)
I need you(I, I)
What I gotta do? (Baby I want you bad)
I need you(I)
I need you(I, I)
Do it all for you (Baby I need you) Hey

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
Baby there's nothing I wouldn't do
To get back what we had when love was true
No lie, I'd give up all I got
Just so I can get back in my spot

[Hook Repeated]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Oh, you want me bad how the cops want black folks
Bad like Dirty Diana
Bad like black toast
Bad like sour lactose like that crack smoke
You feenin'
Left a nigga out to dry like some semen
Baby deaded me
Was far from a dog I had no pedigree, Unh
No leash needed
You ripped up your lease speeded out the crib
Now I'm supposed to just forget and forgive
Pardon, you say I'm your heart
But baby how bad do you want it, want it?

[Outro w/repeated Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
When you want him so bad and you gotta get him back say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
Cuz' it won't get no better til' you are together say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If you believe in ya love and you can't give him up say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If there's nothing you won't do to get back with your boo say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side[Hook]
Is the whole world gunnin for me
Or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothin but time
One day youre gonna set me free
But first you got to let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look mama I’m flying

To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
I’ll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, no, I’ll never ever land

[Verse 1 - J Cole]
Check my fortune cookie, it say Cole World
Could that mean it's meant to be?
So much drive a nigga could've been a chauffeur
This life is fuckin with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they're a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemy
My good girl say they want to know the inner me
My bad girl saying "fuck all that, enter me"
Double shots, Hennessy, bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut somethin, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them motherfuckas sign off
I got them on my dick, they’ll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off
I don’t know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
I’m sortin through this
Organized confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is soundin like a movie you can watch forever
I got to make it to the top, its either now or never
These other niggas can't adapt because they're not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter?
Cole World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And so sick they can’t fix this with modern medicine
We at your door and she's got to let us in
It’s what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now I’m what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as I’m speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I got to catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like I’m the underdog, I’m on already
Got a few niggas we about to prove wrong, yall already already[Intro]
Yeah, what's up girl?

[Verse 1]
Angel eyes, long hair, I see you cryin', what's wrong there
"He did what? He fucked who?", we know the story, what's new?
See I could probably rush you, tell you that he shoulda loved you
Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score, you got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode; why we cheat, I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
Like heterosexuals, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
I never told, I never told

[Interlude 1]
Father: Hey you wanna be a man?
Son: Yeah I wanna be a man
Father: A man don't run and tell his mama everything he see
Son: I ain't gon' tell
Father: Alright, alright then man, be a man then
Son: Alright

[Verse 2]
Ok, that's what it is, I see the game, the hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange, fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The OG's that beat the game, forever young, Peter Pan
35? Still playing; Child support? Still paying
Juggling, bill paying, been running round, field daying
Wine and dine, meal paying, with hopes that she'll lay in
The bed and, get wet then, give head then, you bet man
The same girl who said we just met man, game colder than the fucking dead man
One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids or Reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressed and don't wanna be your ex-man
Cause Cupid aims and throw the darts, there go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?

[Interlude 2]
Wife: You know what? I need to talk to you
Husband: About what?
Wife: I don’t think this is, working out for us
Husband: Why?
Wife: I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that’s all
Husband: What the fuck?!”
Wife: You know?[Intro: J. Cole]
This for all my niggas in the city
But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though, ya know?
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Getting money regiment with my get money regime
Nah mean? yeah

[Verse 1 : J Cole]
New York times, come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money, it seems, by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch, I blow a kiss at her daughter
In the city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibly stressin', a mess, he smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that, all I do is pray for that
This the city of God told me "Go and make it" at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 2 : J Cole]
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick, that's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparations for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We dont make it primetime till we dyin'

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 3: Bas]
How I go from selling reefer and plates
Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly integrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart
Nigga, bitch nigga, take a pause
Hundred shots through the dark you can never hit my heart

[Hook: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York[Intro]
These niggas know
Huh

[Verse 1]
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed; no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 2]
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that,but I never fly that
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacker that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggas know
If not, these niggas know

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I must confess, I cut the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas knowLook at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix breed, fame, and pain, this it's heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just painting my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told, I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Images, everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, then what they believe
Money short, so this jewelry is like a weave
Here to deceive and hear niggas say, "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
The police wanna stop you, frisk you, wonder, "What he do?"
If a hater snatch a chain I bet it still won't free you
Cause I'll be right back grindin' 'til I cop another
I sit and think 'bout all the shit I could've copped my mother
My partner say, "That's just the game, my nigga"
So I hear my jeweler say, "Here goes your chain, my nigga"[Intro: J. Cole]
Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh[Hook]

What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain

[Verse]

The city fucked up, even thug niggas getting robbed
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station
Filling out them applications, but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Paychecks spent on necklaces
Downpayments on them lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft, with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimists
Cause ain't no holding me back
The lil' nigga had big dreams, to do big things
But in this game, everything ain't what this shit seems
Try hard, to climb up to the flag-pole
Just to find out that your heroes is some assholes

[Hook] (x2)

But ain't no holding me back
I'mma get mine, believe that
Aye what's sunshine with no rain
Aye what's joy without the pain
Man I'm still gon' do my thang[Produced by Phonix Beats and J. Cole]

[Intro]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference

[Verse 2]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes

 shame on
 shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Fool me one time, shame on you Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she
Shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna
Be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she
Don't wanna be saved[Chorus]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

[Bridge]
I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever
Something that's old as forever
Love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end

[Outro]
Love, love, love, love[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me
Soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama
On my mama, we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
They say we won't last
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad
Good chick, alone, mad as fuck, she done had enough
I be, out here tryna raise my status up
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, who ain't about nothin'
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart, long before I broke your heart
If I lost your respect, I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been a while
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now
And times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same ?
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from friends to somethin' much more
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more
Second chances, we gave enough
'Til finally we gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories

[Hook]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)[Verse 1]
Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain’t no mystery why there picking me for
I’ve been hot since ’97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I’m skinny, didn’t eat so I’m hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it’s funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn’t get on
One time for my city bitch I’m putting it on
Like a condom when I’m with your girl, ballin’ like it’s intramural
Back in middle school, hoopin’ to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminisce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn’t nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn’t make it past flirting
Now I’m taking baths with their naked ass jerkin
"Make It Last Forever" playing in the background
You can take it as whatever I was laying that down
She gon' hate my ass forever, I ain't bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them text'es, spillin all your stresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast’es
I never disrespected, I’m clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don’t wanna fuck him, now they wanna f-ckin’ like him
And hope he fucking wife em

[Break]
Yeah, nuttin’ like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin’ jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can’t impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh apparently, some of y’all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don’t care to see
Don’t make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your new favorite rapper embarrassed, see
I’m the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don’t wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I’m dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs. Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y’all gotta shed me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me, nigga
Yeah, yehStraight out the dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don’t make it back
Hey, hey, ugh
Gossip from those that barely knew my name
I guess they figured I changed with this new found fame
Or this new damn chain
I’m in a new damn lane
Now my money taller than Shaq stacked with two Yao Mings
But never mind them haters girl
I won’t bring you round lames
Rather bring you round Hov
Let you meet Bron James
Sit you up in VIP and let you sip Champagne
Watch them jealous hoes peeking
Mad they just can’t hang
If that's the ish you into
This life is funny cause despite the money
Nothing stops the rain from pouring
Life ain't always bright and sunny
Nothing stops the pain, you just ignore it
And keep fighting honey
So much drive, ain't no cop alive can take my license from me
I’m swerving on em, fast lane
Fayettenam lifestyle, foot down on the gas man
Passport tight now, I’m leaving on the last plane
Balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name
I said balling was my first love, so you can’t have my last name[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)It's a Cole world, it's no allergies, I'm sick late
Can't underlain, niggas fowlin' me, I switch Haynes'
Switch flows up like Mike Jordan switch hangs
Which explains, I'm the shit, you the shit stain
I'm the type of nigga fuck the baddest and forget name
Meanwhile, you be flyin' 'em out
Me, I just be tryin' 'em out
They love it when you hard on hoes
But I'm Magna Cum Laude, niggas smart on hoes
Which means I seen her intentions
The same time I seen her dimensions
Automatic, I might be leanin' to switches
Got good cop on for sisters, but I'm meaner than bitches
Fuck yeah, won't even leave with the digits to say it's vicious
I say it's necessary for a young legendary
Nigga try to throw you orders, ain't nobody ever taught us
Father, forgive us for the shit we do to your daughters
Up in VIP, poppin' bottles like it's water
Used to ride to Starter
Pardon, cause a part of me just want to save the world
But I don't want to be a martyr
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Caught between a rock and hypogamy always
What's stoppin' me? They say I'm a hypocrisy and doubt me
For God's sakes, better that than be a mockery
Ah, fate, don't talk to me[Produced by J. Cole]

Top, top top, top of the world!

Uh!
I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world

[A.L.]
Uh!
First off, uh, rest in peace Track Willie
Ridin' with me cus, back then nobody pulled for me (Whoo!)
Now I sit back reclined and shine it's all fine
Cus the flow merit status was before my time
I remember daydreamin' when I bust like the semen
Of a heater, said the truth and nobody believed him (Uh uh)
Now the story's fabricated, the public is elated
That somebody from the west considered the next greatest (Who's next)
The Prince (haha), and don't get it twisted (Uh huh)
I spit from the soul but the steez is just gifted
I lived it, talked about him (yeah), ridin' now, we'll walk about it (yeah)
Death of Cornballs like chalk, put the line around it (Haha)
On some D.O.A. shit
No gangsta reality's as real as it gets (Fo' real)
I remember writin' rhymes in the halfway house (Uh huh)
Now I'm sittin' at the top, there's somethin' to talk about

I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world

[J. Cole]
Uh!
These words go together like a verbal collage
It's murder how the words'll collide
And bring you further from where murderers lie
And maybe you could see a mill, no not no burgers or fries
But give you food for thought, my nigga this is Gerber with rhymes
Servin' up lines for your child like mine, nigga this live
So you think you seen a style like mine, it's a mirage
But I, I'll be obliged like Mary J
Then show you how to strive, when it die like everyday
And nigga stay in court like Perry Mason or Gary Payton
New shoes up on his feet like every week, his mom's interogatin'
Like where you been? Who you been with?
Scared he runnin the streets with them freak and them nitwits
Look up in his face, she see the fatherly resemblence
Read him more than a book
Scared he inherited way more than just looks
But uh, mama I'm on top of the world
Uh! I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world![Verse 1: J. Cole]

Dear Mr. Policeman
Am I wrong, ain't you supposed to keep the peace, man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh na, I get it, I get it, I get it)
Or cause I'm black, hmm, maybe?
Tell me why my hands start sweating and I hold my breathe every time you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pull me over, ya frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me, what do you see?
Thug niggas, drug-dealers its a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mothafuckin' college degree

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
My middle finger to the law, bustin' off, tryin' to touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'mma fuckin' try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, we don't make the news
Instead they talk about some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fuckin' a these white hoes
Anchorman stop snitchin'
Cut to commercial, he be textin' all his side bitches
Hey ma-goodness, how ironic
I'm tryed for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your Honor, is you kidding, how you sit above me?
Are you perfect mothafucka? How you finna to judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is Bad Boys, they be just like Puff
They hate their jobs and their days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us

You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fuckin' who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time, stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, yeah
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, feel me

But I can't come up with nothin'

I come back around your way
Searching for what I could say
That accurately could convey
The way that I feel in the word
That's different than what you done heard
So many done hit you wit game
So many been sent to the curb
And I did not come here to play
And I did not come to observe
And I did not come here to play
But I did not come to observe
Feel me

Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it

[Verse 1: J Cole]
This is The Ville, home of the fast-lifers
Where we get high and don't come down, we gas prices
Man, I wonder how hard to live my past life was
Cause this one hard, I could show you my scars
I ain't crying tho..
They say that pity's for the next man
Or that girl getting beat down by her ex-man
Hey, hold your head, mama
I know you wish that nigga dead, mama
If I can find a way to kill him, I won't have man drama
Damn mama, tell me who you love
This one is for the boy that sees his mama on drugs
If feel your pain, boy.. just know that I been through the same, boy
That lady needs you more than ever
Don't be ashamed boy
Cause when it rained, boy, that was your umbrella
The one that changed your pissy sheets when you was a young fella
And now she in the bedroom on her knees
Staring at the sky, screaming "Lord please!"
Tell me now:

[Hook: J Cole]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it

[Verse 2: Omen]
Soon as you cling on, my mind's saying "be gone!"
I leave em with wrinkled foreheads, they now Klingons
Confused, cause friendship's abuse and I'm sorry for it
My life performance been trifling, sometimes I fight my conscience
Was never given spades, but I always had the heart
Always misplaying the hand that was dealt the joker cards
What I was spending like, lonely low energy
Performance slow clinically, rolling over we finna be
Don't pity me ever, when them haters answering
Mindset of a victor, no victim, I'm just a champion
Money come in slow, God, intervene
Spirit's never broken, I'm just focused, don't pity me
No no no, you see this pain put a strain on my whole life
I seen the rain, seen my dreams turn to long nights
But all I ask is don't pity me, no!
Don't pity me, no!

[Hook: J Cole]
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the life that you chose for me?
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?
I won't cry about it, I won't cry about it

[Verse 3: Voli]
I freestyle life, can barely write the rent
Yearly income can barely keep this music life in check
Call up mama, hate to borrow money, but Christmas near
Hey you know what? How about we make each other gifts this year..
Friends are calling me up, asking me if I'm signed yet
Who I'm working with? Am I making dollar signs yet?
Disappoint them, within their voices - do they pity me?
Disbelief - I'mma stay drilling like them city streets
But ah, it seems like every day is rainy weather
Can barely fit my pain and pride the same umbrella
But he don't care, he don't care, it's hard to keep em dry
No more caterpillar, now you see him change: peeping Tom
This life would flash before your eyes
And get your mash before your ride turns to ash
No more drive, no more gas, before you cry, get your last
Before you die, life your past with no regrets
Broken necks, no looking back man[Skit: Freddie P.  & J. Cole]
Hello
Hello
Yeah
Hey, is this Cole?

T-Plain: Oh wassup man?
Wassup?
T-Pain: I really like that shit you be doing!
Awh fuck
T-Plain: HE... HELLO ?[Verse 1]
Bustin, I'm going off
Sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp
Like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me
These hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God, but to me she found Satan
She only getting hotter
What's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said: "That's cool nigga
But can you buy the Benz? "
She playin’ niggas like a violin
I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day's found
This is my playground

[Hook]
This is a playground
But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound
Hey now, hey, this is a playground
But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would you lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound
Hey now, hey this is a playground

[Verse 2]
This is a playground, merry-go-round
Like a dream for a nigga
But I swing on a nigga if he push me
I'm makin' moves like the Rutgers
These ain't no monkey bars motherfucker, not a sucker
But these labels throw me deals like the prosecution
Want to underpay me and fuck me like its prostitution
I write that constitution, you know, that classic shit
How you going to own my masters
And you ain't mastered shit?
Give them my ass to kiss, my lawyer laughed at this
Said they was on some bullshit when they drafted this
Like MJ, so I wagged a finger like Dikembe
Until you niggas talking proper paper, no comprende
And now the deals got mills like Wendy's
And got these labels doing bids like inmates
Hoping my pen lays my name down
Until that day's found, this is my playground

[Refrain][Verse 1]
Runnin' from cops, for hundreds of blocks
Like Short Dawg before he stumbled
And dropped
Gun in my crotch and its unloaded
I just toat it for fun hoping that one day
They catch me on camera like Gunplay
Gunbutting motherfuckers that's one way
To sell a album
Need all the help I can get
Cause on this shelf that I sit, its real lonely
My fans do they still want me?
They waitin', I am fightin' satan
He think I am his lil homie
These stories are metaphors
They hold a deeper message for those who fed up
Hoping you had my life instead of yours
They say the grass is always greener
The pussy's always cleaner on the other side
Until you mow the lawn with gonorrhea
And you realize you had it better
Way before the cheddar came
Looking back I wanted your respect and never fame
But you know the saying right Jermaine
Careful what you ask for
Cause even when you was mad poor
At least laughed more
Never thought I'd still be proving myself on my sophomore
I understand its been a year and a half since my last tour
But things have changed since I last seen the ring
But the one who seem to claim that he the king got a glass jaw
And I'mma break this shit
Cole World no handkerchief

[Interlude: (Charlamagne Tha God)]
Two classics....
Ahhh fuck, fuck me I was about to go off
(Well at least you wasn't reading off a blackberry
You know I was about to ask you about wondering)

[Verse 2]
Two classics and I am Kobe Bryant on some Laker shit
Fighting to make the playoffs
Writing and taking no day offs
I'm on fire like money hungry company lay offs
No pink slips if loose lips sink ships
Then God dammit ahhhh fuck these niggas Titanics
I am joking, only provoking
In hopes to go number one again
Hoping some rappers disses me just to make this shit fun again
It's no fair
Pac had Mobb Deep and Biggie
And I get left with is Tyrese and Diggy
This is bullshit[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me 20 dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night (All night)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Outro: J. Cole]
Back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
*Space Bar Tap*

[Produced by J. Cole][Verse 1]
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though I'm never going back

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me

[Outro]
I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me[Verse 1]
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job
Don’t mean to disrespect you
But we’ve been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby yeah if you only knew
I got bigger problems baby, yeah
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn’t know man
It don’t mean nothing to me
Cause right now I got my little boy crying
And my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me
Listen here, I ain't looking for no tears
But my brother got a year
And my Momma keep smoking that shit
On top of that, I’m broke
Please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then ahana...

[Verse 2]
Hey
Dear, Mr. Policeman
Ay am I wrong, ain't you suppose to keep the peace man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me fo'?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it
Or cause I’m Black, hmmm maybe?
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won’t hear a sound
Man I’m nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see
Thug niggas, drug dealers, it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip gotta motherfucking college degree
And then ahana... unh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my middle finger to the law
Busting off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said impossible but I’mma fucking try
Plus how he gon’ tell me, he don't make the rules
There’s niggas dying every day but we don’t make the news
Instead they talking bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story, Tiger Woods be fucking all these White hoes
Anchorman stop snitching
Cut to commercial, he be texting all the side bitches
Hey my goodness
How ironic
On trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than a comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding
How you sit above me
Are you perfect motherfucker
How you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day you niggas just like us[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
...-Like that, It's like this
When you hear the nigga yo he be in a bliss
'Cause I make the rhymes and it's just a easy gist
With a twist, of my nouns and my verbs
Consummated, into a sentence, ease of words
That I'm at (hmm), so amazin', when I'm blazin'
Just like a trip to Portland, Trail Blazer
But yo listen, yo I gotta say it like this
I got the Phife Dawg and he wants to assist
To persist (yeah) with the rhythm (yeah)
Give 'em (yeah) what you got (yeah)
Phife Dawg hop (check it out) off the mic (check it out) and make the joint hot

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Malik Izaak Taylor is the illest rhyme creator
Let me be the first to say; that I be's a player hater
'Cause I hate when emcees play on this device known as a mic
Then have the nerve to even think that their rhymes and they're tight
So I laugh, quietly watching how the industry's bust
All these video sluts, and guys who front like they're tough
All these million-selling rappers with the bogus-like husks
Withew[? 0:48] brothers screaming "Brooklyn!", when they're probably from Lynbrook
And oh, I see hood raps putting 40's to their lips and head
Go out buy a chalice, and they wanna be a dread, oh my head
Someone pass the buffering, I'm sufferin'
Too many heads out here, word is born, they just frontin'!
I'm stayin' true, making sure my game's legit, no time for ass and getting caught up in that glitzy
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it
But just by having them around lets me know I won't fake it
So big up big up!
Because you emcees ain't ready
Peace to Allen Iverson, my man Stephon Marbury up in, the NBA
And I'm gonna be writin' for the magazine soon
Check me out, boom!
I'm out!

You on point Phife?
Once Again Tip
Word

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

[Verse 4: Phife]
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you got to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

[Hook]
You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once Again Phife
You on point Tip?
Yo once again Phife
Ayo that kid is niiiiiiiice

[Chorus: Tammy Lucas]
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on[Instrumental][Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face!

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'?
Love and peace from Phife for '93, know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown 83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

[Interlude]
*sounds of frogs

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool[Intro: Phife and Tip]
Back at you
Right back at you

[Verse 1: Tip + Phife + both]
Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away, think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window, the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all?
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

[Hook: Tip and Phife]
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world?
Hell yeah the world
Me and you girl go against the world

[Verse 2: Tip + Phife + both]
Dame un beso, s'il vous plait
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way
If we was on video, I'd press rewind
A nigga think about you all the time
Pigeon dropped a note, on top my head
RnB, pop, girls thoroughbred
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...
Pick you up
Raise your cup, let love erupt
Vol-ca-no, natural disast'
Fall in love with me? Huh, well that's that ass
Wanna get you, inside my world
Process, straight, afro or curl
Stretch me out, phase me in
Forever you and me, let me see you grin
He fucked you, I'mma tap his chin
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on "The Promo"
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

[Outro]
Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
The madman Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia
Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin', master as in great
I'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'
While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin' around with wack rhymin'
You lose your grip from chalk climbin'
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cipher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef
Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street
Phife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Makin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath

[Chorus: Consequence]
Ay yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I'll be lettin' off gism
Writin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucka MC in my path, hey man, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit
'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, every day all day, similar to water
Crushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians
Ya new mean

[Outro]
Word up
I just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest

You know what I'm sayin'? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man

Bouncin' it all over the place, up in your face

Am I a sinner because I do the two?

If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics

And you know, they ask me to get on the mic
And they ask me
Can I kick it?
Word
(Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?[Intro: Q-Tip]
Do I love you?
Do I lust for you?
Am I a sinner because I do the two?
Can you let me know
Right now, please
Bonita Applebum

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Hey Bonita, glad to meet ya
For the cunning, stunning you, miss, I must beseech ya
Hey, being with you is a top priority
Ain't no need to question the authority
Chairman of the board, the chief of affections
You got mine's to swing in your direction
Hey, you're like a hip-hop song, you know?
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
38-24-37 (mmm, mmm, mmm)
You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't
I like to tell ya things some brothers don't
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics
So far, I hope you like rap songs
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
I used to be all on it like a fly to shit
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit
I flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end
But you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
Honey, you was funny but I'm tired of that
It's three years later, I got a new rap
You got a little older, a titbit wiser
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
Speaking of high I saw you smoke a hootie mack
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
But I'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
Slapping my knees, letting out sighs
Want to keep it slamming like a hip-hop song
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum (go 'head with yourself)
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)

In the words of the immortal Sweet Daddy (uh)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I'll never shed a tear but then again I won't steer
You wrong, I steer you strong, for affection steer here
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the Uno
What do you know, if we go to El Segundo
Your presence should be closer like on "Buddy" I'll toast
To the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
Honey, you're my honey, a-yo, dip, you're my dip
Treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with Tip
As we glide and move
Cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
Ricky D said we got to "show and prove"
Do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
Intimidate the boy
Cupid that's his name
Picking all us suckers is his flipping game
But Tip don't fall for that
Instead I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest
Lambskin store, get a six-pack of hats for

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum (hey hon, hey hon)
Bonita Applebum (go 'head with yourself)

[Outro][Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
"Oh yo he's acting stank," really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out[Phife Dawg]
Fuck the car-jacking, Phife Diggy is rapping
Got dawgs with love and plus dawgs that's packin
So what's the deal Captain, if it's time for some action
Watch me roll with hon, try to push her back
Which one of these niggas, think they fuckin wit dis?
Put your money on Queens, yo these cats is pissed
Meanin hot green and stinky, see shorty there winkin?
Hit her off so hard, that her eyes start blinkin
Then massage her down, with the word serene
It's the Dawg For Pres, new star on the scene
And I'm here for the battle, right down to the letter
If it rains today, then it's a double-header
Range Beemaz and Benz, 1100's and Jettas

We the stars y'all, and everyone beckons far
You a star and you shining, I'm one and I'm rhyming
Let's get together, start intertwining
Yo you coming with me, somewhere where you can't see
With his bonafide joints, underneath the sea
Of confusion and glitter, nobody's a quitter
Try to front and get ripped, from your ear to your shitter
Gon' put it on harder than anyone did
It would benefit you to keep a wide open lid
Makin sho' shot shit, makin sure you shine
Takin shows for sure, takin hearts in time
Do it all for the rhyme, and the rhythm and things
When we do it we bangin, like we inside the bank
Ain't doubtin nobody, when we inside the jam
But I'm proud overall, and I know who I am

* a lot of "yo" from Busta Rhymes *[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, "Diane made it"
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
(Can I kick it?)

[Chorus: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
(Can I kick it?)[Intro]

Believe it or not, that is the sound of an invasion. Yes, that is the sound created by the musical invasion of America by the world's hottest recording group: A Tribe Called Quest

They are non-conformists to such a great degree that no two members ever dress alike. And many educators consider their popularity resulted from their becoming symbols of teenage rebellion

They certainly are raking in a lot of good green American money and gathering hundreds of thousands of teenage fans in the process

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & (Phife Dawg)]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
(And me, the Five Footer)
(I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter)
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
(Um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen)
(I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon)
Heh, okay, you on point Phife? (All the time, Tip)
You on point Phife? (All the time, Tip)
You on point Phife? (All the time, Tip)
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg & (Q-Tip)]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer (And me, the Abstract)
(The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack)
Ayo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock (What?)
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
(Um, let me see, damn I can't remember)
(I receive the message and you will play the sender)
You on point Tip? (All the time, Phife)
You on point Tip? (Yeah, all the time, Phife)
You on point Tip? (Yo, all the time, Phife)
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper—what you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

[Outro: Q-Tip]
NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all

(*scratching* - "Clap your hands now")

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Brothers know the flavs when the Quest gets loose
Slamming sucker fuckers like the wrestler Zeus
Crazier than 2Pac in the flick called Juice
Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss
Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Duice
Gets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke
Control the mic like Denzel on the girls
Wack MCs be on the nuts like Rocket J. Squirrel
The worst thing in the world is a sucker MC
Favorite rap group in the world is EPMD
Can't forget the De La, due to originality
And if I ever went solo my favorite MC would be me
Phife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy
Peace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies
Like um, Ralph Malph to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger
Laverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger
Ren to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy
Q-Tip and Phife, they mash up the party
Kick the rhymes and more rhymes
Kick the beats and more beats
We'll have you scratching in your head like Shaheed on Technics
For those who wanna oppose then take a stand
But for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
You just wanna dance man, then clap your hands
If you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance
Will be crucial, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you
So listen
The Abstract intuition is very very worthy
I can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey
Can't understand the underground, it gets deep
The Lo, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps
The women, the lingo, and all the other goods
Peace to the hoods, keep my shit on play
Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke
Brothers know the angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner
Hook up the beats at the funk manor
If you want a roll, then the dough I be raking
The scope is on the world cos it's mine for the taking
You know I'm gonna do it
My shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid
Chemists get confused of my ill composition
This is the third of the new Tribe addition
MCs be swinging, but a lot of them be missing
So shut your bloodclot and listen
Cuz I'm bringin you the ill rendition
I'd like to send this out to the L.E.S
Gotta a lot of rhythm and style and finesse
Come here love, hot sex on a plat
And when you're done with that then clap

[Hook] - repeat until end

[Outro]
Keep bouncingQ-Tip:
Who that at the door? (Yo, Tip, it's her)
What you doin here, in front of my face? (repeat 3X)
You didn't want my...you didn't want it
So go somewhere where you are wanted
But if you want to, then you can come here
Come here, yo

Q-Tip:
Have you ever met a woman that just took your breath? (yeah uh huh uh uhuh, yeah uh huh)
So deep inside her life, she contemplated death (damn she deep, give a fella the creeps)
Can't help but get attached to a woman like that (true that)(repeat 4X)
The contact was quite immediate, I had to attack
(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)
We related and debated over food and tunes
Started out in September, now we enterin June (say word)(repeat 4X)
Simple night in the crib, no, it just won't do
(no it just won't do, no it just won't do)
Because she liable to start shit too wild for you
(wild for you, wild for...)
She wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips
And take on trips, conversin my flip
Gotta do her hair, take her out to the fair
Win a teddy bear, make sure you don't stare
At another one comin, don't be startin nuthin
Be a slave to her, don't be brave to her
Make sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong
When she wants it, do it, make sure that it's long
If anyone wanna make it work it's me (Phife Dawg help me out)(repeat 2X)
But we gotta come to a common ground baby
Any man, he can claim to be the one for you
But put it straight to yourself and realize what's true

Chorus:
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 4X)
Get it going on, let's get it going on
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 2X)

Q-Tip:
Phife Dawg in the break, is she more than you can take?

Phife:
See, I'm not the one to be taken advantage of
And if you really think about it, I got nuthin but love
Now if your heart isn't in it, please let me know
There's no need to waste time, if it's no, then I'll go

Chorus:
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 4X)
Get it going on, let's get it going on
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 2X)
Get it going on, let's get it going on[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio
Just done mash a show, Dawg is off on sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling
Swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (ooo)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around
Sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground

[Guitar Solo: Jack White][Intro: Q-Tip]
Just a lil somethin-somethin
About the cats who be fronting
You know the Tip, he be huntin
For all the goodness gracious
All across the wide spaces
Yo, check it out, bust me down, yo
Yo... yo...

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Youse my peoples, why it got to come down to this shit
Two people thinking as one so now he split
Remember what I said to you, you bleed, I bleed
C'mon, you know how we get down, if you're down, you need
And I'm supplying, the dynamic duo, electrifying
Everybody had to wet us, cuz no one will forget us
Son, I testify sure as God was my guide
Any petty little bullshit you did will slide
Same on my end, after all, what are we, friends
If niggas ran me this, too much grounds we defend
In the honor or brotherhood cuz it's all good
Get on some grown man shit and let's knock on wood
But now seeing you baby in this stall out position
Wondering who's the dime piece that you're kissing
You might as well take the jigger and take my life
Cuz the dime piece you happen to be kissing is my wife
Shit, I should have know not to let these crab asses
Get within the circle of my girl and make passes
Now you disrespected me and everything I stand for
(But I'm saying though, son) Shhh, say no more
Allah forgive me, my thoughts is traveling to low desires
Should I turn the other cheek or react and perspire
Don't wanna see myself in penitentiary attire
But I caught him in the act and my emotion is dire

[Spoken word][Q-Tip]
Question
What is it that everybody has
And some pirates and thieves try to take?

[Hook]2x
Da Booty (and if you is a crook than you takin' it)
Da Booty (and if you got money you shakin' it)
Da Booty (come on everybody that's here, that's word
To Phife Dawg and my man Shaheed)

[Q-Tip]
I give my promise to all y'all to keep my shit hittin'
Half of y'all claim dog but meow like kitten
Flippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton
Get off that ass and see what I'm settin'
Born with this inside, you just can't get it
This is the lethal pop and you have no weapon
Who is the native brother who keep asses steppin'
Make deep impressions and constantly be reppin'

[Phife]
When I was young I'd stretch gaucho
Now I'm on Letterman, on the couch, yo
The black thing with knives is called the back do'
Can't we be cool instead of being foul though
Ghetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars
Impressions of live sometimes makes ya holler
Scream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar
You dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother

[Q-Tip]
Phife Dawg puttin' the bite back in yours
Top dog, puttin' it up, flick his balls
MC from now til I get a frown
Shake that ass girl because you world renowned
Wake up, look at the sun, see the sights
Bull duke, you've got to die for your rights
MC's, y'all got to work for the mic
Zombies, do it from dusk to the night

[Hook]2x

[Q-Tip]
Rock to the beat, yo it's never the same
Good girls usually got good game
Hot cats tearin' that ass out the frills
Block ass, you had no skills, that's the reals
Make this money without the friction
Take this honey, there goes your diction
Rappers better retreat, fix your joints
My whole crew got bumps on they points

[Phife]
Rumors being spread 'bout me and my click
We can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shhh
Might not've heard it, or maybe you have
Between me and you, they can kiss my ass
Used to get angry, used to get quite vexed
But say what you may, just cash my check
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is going on tour
Doing shows galore, and bringin' it raw

Man, Tip, you think you all that now that you on wax
Or something that you can tell a brotha what to do?
You know I’m older than you? I’m your senior, brotha
Man, you better go someplace with that old fool nonsense
I’m gon’ keep doin’ what I gotta do
And survive the way I gotta survive, know’m’sayin’?
You can’t do nuthin’, can’t do nuthin’, man
Know’m’sayin’? I’ve been out here too long doin’ my thing
[Verse 1: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Jarobi, (Q-Tip & Phife Dawg), & (Q-Tip & Jarobi)]
Handle rocks with the capital G, ball on the beat
Status, Chris Paul and John Wall in the league
Grabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed
('Cause I believe
The potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed)
If rationale is naturale or a weave
It's all edges and peas
Settin' press, we on a permanent steeze
I'm in a world where my princess is Leia
And she's feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater
Chem trails, droppin' poisonous vapors
Have you shaking like Gator
Been trill, nigga, process the data
Blu-ray, wave file, or a Beta, I'll DVR it for later
Kappo Masa with a G to my waiter
You can't define us, XY us, or Z us
You generational elitists
Have your chi in virtual think pieces
(See, these written words are poetical science
Brain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby
They're a major appliance)Leave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant
Dude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers
Cool with some buyers
Yeah, nigga, cool with some growers
(Never no tattletales, only I don't knowers)
We a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us
So listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing
Mouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys
Versed in, rehearsed in the soothing of loins
Talk to Joey, Earl, Kendrick, and Cole, gatekeepers of flow
They are extensions of instinctual soulIt's the highest in commodity grade
And you could get it today

Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation
Rules di nation

[Verse 2: Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes, Jarobi, & (Phife)]

Telly is low, cuddle bunny ready to go
Day of the dead
Bury all the zombies instead
And it's just your aftermath, Busta cuttin' your dreads
Bruce Leein' niggas, while you niggas UFC
Smoke tree on niggas, sizzle out your USB
(Surge pricing on these Ubers, I'mma get me a cab)
Yo, where Jarobi at?
Imbibing on impeccable grass
I be in NYC waiting for that law to pass
(Pass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last
Richard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass)
Magic Mike on the mic, David Blaine, Douglass Henning
In the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting
Horizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens
Don't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgivenLike how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen
B-b-b-b-b-b-but wait
Just spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet
This mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife

Not acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase
We still the highest of commodity grade

Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ego, ego
I got one, you got one, and now we equal
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to
It's called the ego

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen
It's called the ego
Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it
Then every time you mention it
They stare like you're two-headed
But one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view
Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken
And you know that she's your people
They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy
And now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy
Change your diet, hit the gym
And say, "What were you saying to me?"
The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest
It's the ego

[Bridge: Q-Tip]
Ooo, Jack White
Ooo, Jack White

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
A celebrated genius, my dick game is the meanest
I'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented
I'll take the biggest house in Calabassas
Anyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes?
You need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling
Or when those kids in school on your locker
They get to scrawling
Epithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature
Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya
Ego make you violent or govern like a tyrant
Or switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant
Fool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles
Fooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models
Ego has no ending, has people pretending
Religious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending
This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us
And closing for our ego, we know only God can help us

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

[Verse 5: Phife Dawg]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, "No", labelled me a ho
I said, "How you figure?" "My friends told me so"
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets

[Verse 7: Phife Dawg]
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

Keep bouncing[Intro: Q-Tip]
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Enough, enough, enough

[Verse 1: Jarobi]
Yo, I'm savant with the game
Gon' tell Robi yo' name
Provide words that's heard, setting your body aflame
Ooh, you off the chain, I'm handling your terrain
Your valley h-has me standing down to the follicle
'Bout half of this bottle full of reasons for us to ball
Palming violations and travel vacation, ma
Lace your fancy bra, gon' take them vestments off
Skin and my lips involved, I'm licking a place that's soft
Jedi

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Is this enough?
Enough, enough, enough

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Is it an issue if I make you nut?
But there's no quality time 'cause I forever grind
This is not an excuse, I just wanna get loose
That's old nigga jargon, girl, you're making me hardened
To a stone or granite statue, I'm prone to get at you
It's hard to break your defense, I guess I have to leap fence
Or scale wall, and break fall on a tree right by your window
Reward me for my efforts by rolling this indo
As I nibble your neck naughtily, sex is a big part of me
Agencies want to audit me, searching, snooping for sodomy
My thrust bust artery, I know you're on to me
Just wanna have shenanigan
Don't wanna make you mad again
So focus on the flattery you feel when I fling it
Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it
Dirty talk loud but they saying, "Fuck the shit out of me"
At the Queen's request, if it's gotta be, it's gotta be

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Is this enough?[Chorus]
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Look at Miss Elaine who runs the fast lane
Barely knows her name, struck by fame
She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
Rollin' down the block, checkin' out the spots
She winks at the cops, always give her props
She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her
Hangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter
Tried to make my moves on Miss Elaine, she called me young boy
Told her not to diss me I just wants to be your love toy
You young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me
Business oriented, egos never dented
Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it
Distractions never hurt, always did the work
Always was alert, she never got jerked
Queen of the feats, thrive to compete
Love the funky beats while she drove down the street
She was justified, couldn't get a job
Had to feed her family, so she had to play the mob
Pullin' out the oowop, listenin' to doo-wop
(You don't have to say a word)
(*gunshots*) That's all ya heard

[Chorus]
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner
Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater
Put me on her roster to rid her of imposters
And to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive
Plus I needed ducats to fill up my buckets
Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
'Cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be
I'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me
I played my cards well, try to live swell
For the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell
But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin
Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
Elaine, she kinda knew, that I would do the do
But she didn't tear, I did my work with care
That's all that really mattered, her money never splattered
As long as she was paid, she was in the shade
You can't really blame her for holdin' on a flamer
Society taught her, but they didn't tame her
A ten clip salute, hunny here's a troop
She will never stop until she reach the top
Top, top...[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, "Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael"
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that [ass]
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half

[Chorus]
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Interlude: Sample]
"Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—"

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu [shit]
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a [bitch], brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)

[Chorus]
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Outro: Sample]
"—time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
Every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out
Time is running and passing, passing and running, running and passing, passing and running—"[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

[Q-Tip]
Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
*heavy breathing*

[Phife]
Speaking of which
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss (come on)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (what?)
End of the day you're not mad at me (uh)
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me (what?)
I said: "hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly" (come on)
Cause yo, picture me messing it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-Cups
Shit, I'm on my J.O. (come on)
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow (what?)
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal yo?
(Deal yo, yo, yo...)

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (ha-ha!)
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (come on)
Should I just sit out or come harder? (huh?)
Help me find my way

[Q-Tip]
Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we're there
You douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air
Telling me 'bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan
Who got your heart in mind?
It's about time that you just unwind (come on)

[Phife]
And let it just happen, make it front-free (uh)
Just sweat me like Moneypenny (uh)
Digging you, getting inside of your stee (what?)
It's the Quest cat keeping you company (ha)
Forever, or however you want it

[Q-Tip]
Word, word
Now wait a minute ma before you jet into the curb (yeah, yeah)
Start to make affections, which is good not the herb
But it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred (uh)
I'mma still just chill with you
Maybe things could change if you change your view (come on)
If not, then, I guess it is cool (yeah)
Just to keep to yourself and abide by the rules, right

Like that y'all
Check it out now...

Wha wha now...

Now you caught my heart for the evening (talk it out now)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (now sing it)
Now you caught my heart for the evening (sing it out)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (take your time)
Should I just sit out or come harder?

As we start trudging
Me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level on the bass and on the treble?
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us 'cause we rarely dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
All over the field, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield

[Interlude: Jesse Jackson]
And the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
It's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. Walk tall!

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a Jeep
But dig it in the ground because the footprint now

[Interlude: Jesse Jackson]
Walk tall!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said "Black is black"
You can come while we Quest, I don't play, I don't jest
Get emotions off your chest, we are Black, we been blessed
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong[Verse 1: Q-Tip]

There's a sign of the sands of time, can you believe it?
'Fore the sun sets and rises again, you should read it
As you walk out the ways of man, there is a plan you should perceive it
Then indeed it is a path to a promise if you need it
Now you'll think of them when it's time to sink or swim
And we'll provide you moral compass to guide you
You'll survive through what most others have tried to
And as the tides grew, you found out you would fly too
So receive it as a beacon of light so I can see it
To leave footprints, one must be undefeated
You hear me?
To leave footprints, one must be undefeated

[Chorus: Cherokee][Intro: Phife Dawg]
Yeah yeah, gentlemen, ha ha
NFL GameDay, you know how we stay, word up
Yeah, I wanna give a shoutout to Chris Berman, Tom Jackson
Joe Theismann, Sterling Sharpe, you know’m’sayin’
Brothers from ESPN
I wanna give a shout to Howie Long, Terry Bradshaw, Ronnie Lott
And the rest of the boys up at FOX, John Madden
You know’m’sayin’, this is how we do it
Mike Ditka and the crew up at NBC, Bob Costas
Whatever’s clever—take a loss never
Yo, check it, yo


[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Too many crews front like they’re outta order
But probably could not manage if their name was Tom LaSorda
Rod Hampton been my man since his school days in Georgia
And then Garrison Hearst, but Herschel was first
When Malik is in the house, I want silence, no violence
Speedy Rodney Hampton and Phife, true New York Giants
Forever pushing wigs back—yo, we like it like that
I’m from the Rotten Apple—getting played, I just can’t see that
Yo, which MC’s should I start to exploit?
Got that Lion Jay Dee, roaring straight from Detroit
With mad tracks up his sleeves, you wouldn’t believe
The Ummah got more wins than that man Dan Reeves
Overachieve, ‘cause of the blessings from Jehovah
Some call Him Jah, and Muslims say Allah
But back to the matter at hand, Rodney, my man
Yo, get on the mic and do the best you can
‘Cause there’s a lot of MC’s that come with songs that ain’t strong
NFL for dat ass will stand for “Not For Long”
There’s a lot of MC’s that come with songs that ain’t strong
NFL for they ass will stand for “Not For Long”

[Verse 2: Rodney Hampton]
My name is Hampton, they call me “Hot Rod”
Before stepping to me, you better pray to your God
Even folks on the West knows who’s in charge
Top 10 running backs, I never try to play large
Never step in the way of my jersey 2-7
You’re better off reading the Bible (Ask your reverend)
Always on point with that cat named Phife
When I run the ball, it’s like running for my life

[Chorus: Phife + (both)]
(How long?) Not long (Not For Long)
(How long?) Not long (Not For Long)
(How long?) Not long (Not For Long)
NFL for dat ass will stand for “Not For Long”
(How long?) Not long (Not For Long)

(How long?) Not long (Not For Long)
NFL for they ass will stand for “Not For Long”

[Verse 3: Rodney Hampton]
With the pigskin in my hand, I’m thinkin’

(Give it to me, yeah, ‘til Phife Diggy come in)
Never weak, yeah, I get strong like a lion
Forever representin’ on the gridiron

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg]
Yeah, Malik Izaak will hit ya with that run dat sh

Pass me the mic and watch us get intimate
Not only does it walk with me, it talks to me
Taps me on the back and says, “Son, that was a job well done”
“Why, thank you. I’m glad I could be of great service”
‘Cause it’s mad MC’s out here nowadays that sound nervous
Life is too short to still be sounding like a novice
You can’t MC, then get your ass up out my office
Brothas is like, “Oh, my head, it can’t be him again”
Bite my style like a Wolverine from Michigan
When they see my faith, them boys get stiffer than a mannequin
Been writing joints since the tender age of nine or ten
I know this year mad silly heads will be vexed with me
Especially if they know they have no strategy
Don’t step to me, I’m the one that you don’t wanna see
You know my stee, you must be drinking too much Hennessy
Phife Diggy Dawg, my title be “Mr. Melody”
You tryna play me as if my name is Stanley
Knowing damn well my style is legend like Lombardi
But in this case, it’s just for mashin’ up the party
So when you see me and my clique, keep your ass still
Or take mad L’s, exactly four like the Buffalo Bills
Me and my crew, we got more wins than George Halas
Or better yet, Tom Landry in his years out in Dallas
You try to test the Kennel Club, two to your jaw
Keeping it new and improved like the Ravens from Baltimore

[Outro: Phife Dawg]
What? What what? (Ha ha)
What what? (Ha ha) What what? (Ha ha)
It’s like that, son (Yeah); it’s like that, son (Yeah)
Phife Diggy Dawg, you best believe I’m the one
Not the two, not the three, not the four
But my favorite number’s five
Keep it live, represent the Tribe
Not the one, not the two, not the three, not the four
But my favorite number’s five
Keep it live, represent the Tribe, ha ha ha ha
And yo, we out like that
Big shout to the Packers and Niners, ‘cause no one do it finer
Eagles, my man Rick Watters
My man Marshall Faulk running things in Indianapolis
You know’m’sayin’, word up
Pittsburgh Steelers, Jermoe Bettis, yeah yeah
Kansas City Chiefs, who want beef?
Just buggin’—NFL stands for “Not For Long”
When you come with doodoo songs that ain’t strong
So get gone—son, what?
A’ight, take me up outta here

Listen up money or should I say honey
Listen up money or should I say honey

[Phife]
In the beginning there was Adam and Eve
But some try to make it look like Adam and Steve
Like Georgie, why can't money find a honey
I couldn't believe when I found out he was funny
You know fierce with just his right ear pierced
I couldn't hack it, I knew this brother for years
Walking in the ville with them long dreadlocks
But on the DL, getting done up the butt box
Oh my God how gross can one be
Well anyway, better him than me
Used to be down with the crew and had the girls that were def
Instead of staying to the right, he fell off to the left
So Lord J being that you go next
Pull the rest of his card cause I'm vexed

[Lord Jamar]
My man George got a germ that's ill
Suffering from terminal scag
But never ever getting caught walking like a fag
That's not his bag cause the plague was afraid to parade in drag
So instead he played the DL, brothers get jel
Cause honey's on his dick but money won't swell
He'd rather call Manuel for a little duel
Have a swordfight with tools
He's wounded and I can't understand
Why a man would want to be a weak cipher man
I thought the plan was to be hard as a rock
Not riding a jock, sucking on a cock

My man George I thought he was on base
Find out later that he was a closet case
Woah woah he's a sweet thing
George was down with the titty titty bang bang
Now George swung with gays, just the way he sways
Even fooled around with his mom's lingerie
Come get it girl, something fierce was his line
Even wore a dress and on his face he had swine
He cipher monkey cipher, you fucking faggot
Couldn't wait for gay parade so you can drag it
George used to flip, went from hitting skins to sucking nigga's dick
George better get a grip

[Sadat X]
Now Georgie used to run with the ill brothers
Kids who liked to rob mothers, and do a bunch of crazy things
He had the ladies, a baby, a shiny black .380
That he always kept tucked and filled with the slugs
Now watch how money bugs
Weight fell it's hard to tell but believe me George has slid
Coming out the closet was the dress that he hid
From the boys when we was over there I seen it out the corner of my eye
I said damn Georgie George signify
The whole crew seen it now the whole block knows
That George gets his kicks from wearing Wisdom's clothes

[Q-Tip]
Now Georgie Porgie pudding pie
What made you choose the path of the gays, oh why
Ain't got no reason, to hell with alibis
Won't play basketball cause your nails ain't dry
Call me homophobic but I know it and you know it
You're filthy and funny to the utmost exponent
Never will I do that, disrespect my mommy
So run and hide your salami
Used to, didn't you, used to be my man
Instead of shaking, you're dragging your hand
Yes it's the Abstract the info provider
Here's your new name - the rump rider

[Hook x3][Intro]
Drifting back... suddenly
Drifting back (just) suddenly
Drifting back (just) suddenly

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
The deadly venom, let me start from the beginning
We always hitting, so yo, there'll be no extra innings
As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction, what, the main feature
And I'mma greet ya, like a rhyming ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brother well prepared is the brother who will start
And that's me Akh
I, as long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand
Cause that happens to be the nature of man
Sexuality, it is the format baby
Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes
But I praise the Lord of the worlds that's unseen
Respect me for that and let me do my thing
I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing

[Chorus]
You know we gotta get a hold
Over the illest drum rolls

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, how you doing? Let me give you an intro
My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MC's resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncing my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your egos on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your clique
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see my name's not Dick
The Tribe is the crew that makes the mics get lit
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
But that's aight, now, I'm on some true work shit
And I'mma make it happen for my whole outfit

[Chorus]
You know we got to get control
Over the illest drum rolls

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
A-yo, we just getting started, got to redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison
Y'all really need to go lay down cause positivity has risen
We hitting, yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time, we ain't joking
For security, yo we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doing the hustle and you backstage vogueing
We all got faults, don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings, there's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme, damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel but next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight that we don't need
We slim with disabilities and thick with possibilities
Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigating with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
And strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still ring bells
There ain't no plan B's, yo watch, we moving through with plan A
Money market doing things the right way

[Chorus]
You know we gotta get a hold
Over the illest drum rolls

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Yo bust it out section, section
Section Linden Boulevard
Section on Merrick
Section the whole Jamaica
Section on Flushing
Section in Bed-Stiduy[Intro: Q-Tip]
Yo, yo, don't say nothin'
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, just get on the dance floor and be alright

[Chorus: Q-Tip & (Consequence)]
You know what this is, pa, we 'bout to set it off
Hands up off your side
Throw your joints in the air and keep your body movin'
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up) Hands high
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up) Hands high
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up) Hands high
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up)

[Verse 1: Consequence]
What up, cat? It's my stick shift, you automat'
ATM plans and a cell phone jack
When y'all jokers snap, my mic got LoJack
'Cause I've been getting chips since John and Ponch-o
Keep your mouth closed and come on up out yours
I shot the sheriff, that makes me outlaw
Give me everything, withdraw up out yours
'Cause I got fam to feed, chicks that need weaves
Tore up in the hood tryna P.I.M.P
When you in the midst of a robbery
What's the procedure? Here's the procedure
I'm soon to be one up in a million like Aaliyah

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
You're like the Outlaw Josey Wales with steel in your ribs
I advise you do what we say and that's it
Like Butch Cassidy, I make all the sons dance
And on the stagecoach, I keep the dimes in trance
I'm riding off in the sun with pockets lumped out
Leave the town verbin' with jewels and love about
Who be the black cat cat with the intelligence
Make it a civilized poke, regain sense
It's me, Jimmy Cliff, harder they come, they fall out
The stressed out stranger rearrange your ball out
I'm getting target practice with the sure shot aims
Run you on the dance floor with my Jesse James
So click clack, it's like that
Click clack, The Abstract
Click clack, the Consequence
We coming through, and we making you tense

[Chorus: Q-Tip & (Consequence)]
Yo, you know what this is, pa, we 'bout to set it off
Hands up off your side
So throw your joints in the air and keep your body movin'
And you will be a'ight
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up) Hands high
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up) Hands high
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up) Hands high
'Cause it's a (stick up, stick up, sticky stick up)

[Verse 3: Consequence]
The Black English professor, throws you under pressure
Making lakes in your jersey, like Jerome Kersey
Jealous and you're thirsty, cut open a cactus
You scared to soar to new heights like B.A. Baracus
I'm wild for the night, you's a daytime actress
192, we been rebels, hold you captive
Regis and Kathy never seen this live host
Upholding space jams, hitting hang 'em high notes
Catch me pushing more Cherokees than Walter Oates
Folks on the check in
Bills get passed and Billy Razor gets elected
Now who defected?
Broke camp and switched stations, Queens the foundation...[Q-Tip]
Ali with the scratch
We never looking back
Do it with the cut
Party people, move your butt
Ali with the scratch
We never looking back
Do it with the cut now
Yo Kennedy, turn it up

Isn't anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay
She's the kind of girl you love so much it makes you sorry
Still, you know me better single day
Ah girl (girl girl)
Girl (girl girl)
Ah girl (girl girl)
Girl (girl girl, girl girl)
Ali plays the bass
We illin' in the place
Dawg with the rhyme
You know we gon' shine
Ali's good with the bass
We illin' in the place
Dawg with the rhyme
Damn girl, you're looking fine, f-f-fine, f-fine, f-fine

Mama, listen, love thing, the right way
Big man with a big dream to boot
I got to get you inside the system
Sit on Santa's lap, damn, you cute
Can't you just envision the way
That this could blossom into a rose
And if the rose was to die, I guess
The smell would just linger, I suppose
You assume that my words are faulty
Doubting with the stance that I take
It's not my fault that most of the dudes
That you used to mess with turned away
Shorty, you can't be all of that
If you could just let me be the one
There is no other dog like the Phife Dawg
At least not on this side of sun
If you don't want to, please let me know
And I'll kindly proceed to bounce but
Maybe if I can say so myself
I know that you've been checking me out
Let bygones be bygones and then
Let's not rush it, that never end
Keep on moving to feel the Zen
Watch how we make opposites blend

Ali plays the bass
We illin' in the place
Dawg with the rhyme
You know we gon' shine
Ali with the scratch
Never looking back
Do it with the cut now
Yo Kennedy, turn it up[Hook]
Doing our thing in Queens
We had dreams about being emcees
And there was no concern about so and so
And these record companies
But now we all are grown
And the spots is getting blown
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
Nah, we ain't none of them, B
Give me, so give me
Nore, Phife Dawg and Abstract
Give me, to everyone in the world
Nore, Phife Dawg and Abstract

[Noreaga]
Yo in Iraq, all my niggas love Abstract
Yo, from Far Rock to Flushing, concussion
Every time a nigga rhyme it's like we get our bus' on
I used to ride a dollar van and really get my bus on
Yo, from South Don to El Segundo
All my niggas getting high yo, and still living on the run though
Get a lot of dough so now we have a lot of fun though
Q-U, two E's, N-S
All we really care about is money, cheeba and sex
What what what

[Q-Tip]
Niggas get faded, never outdated
Give it to the world cause for long they waited
Shorties online to cop the new CD
So Hip Hop I bust nut in graffiti
We could two-piece it or we could just cease it
Shorty on my shit cause my style wild decent
What's it gonna be, the party or the precinct?
Queens cats rock, keep it rugged and recent
My nigga Nore thug it out (thug it out, no doubt)
Phife Dawg bugging out (bugging out, no doubt)
The Love Movement no doubt (Love Movement, no doubt)
Ali Shaheed get a shout (shout it out, no doubt)

[Noreaga]
Yo perate, hold on, take a time out
Huddle up, yo, Queens niggas won't fuck it up
Keep my Southside niggas just playing the cut
While my Queensbridge people stay roughing you up
East Elmhurst, Corona, Ayatollah
Keep the caller ID on the Motorola
Gotta keep the po-po on the payola
Queens niggas shut it down, now it's all over

[Phife]
192, the Bouley Fran Lew
Merrick, Van Wyck, Hollis Ave, Guy Brew
Head up Jamaica Ave cop a tape by DJ Clue
Move to the Acres, sipping on a guinney brew
Scooping ladies up in ??? makes my day complete
Freestyling over beats for my peoples in the street
This is a place where stars are born
Linden to Laurelton, we keep it hot like porn

[Hook][Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Yup yup yup
To the North to the South to the East to the West
I don't discriminate boy I bring it to your chest
If you oppose, then your soul will decompose
Strive to get money and I'm not no hoe
Fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose
Iller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes
You can ask Bo but yo that nigga don't know
About the dominant factor, the accurate rapper
Here's the next chapter, page ninety-five
Niggas so hard it's a wonder they alive
But yo we still survive through the danger that lurks
My eyes remain wide while you ass like Urk
And yo my Family Matters, so all you mad hatters
Put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm
'Cause I got the plan that wins and can't lose
Your man knows who's nice, say Tip, he'll say "True"
A lot of these jokers out here is blasé
I'll be rockin mikes until a horse says 'hey'
Some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz
Actin all bougie and making big movies
But I'll be in the cut, call me Incognito
Busy making joints that will bump for my people
You're listening to a man who was something from nothing
Stay in me forever head, never be frontin'

[Chorus 2X]
Once in a while we have fun in the mix
Into good living but some be into glitz
Everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks
We gotta wear a shoe that fits

C'mon word, check it out now [you out there?]
Uh, uh, check it out now [you out there?]
What? Uh, check it out now [louder! louder!]
[Louder! louder!] Uh, check it out, yo

[Verse 2]
Peace to the girl named Hurricane G
Peace to my girl named Dawn Paris
Peace to the Organized Kon-fus-ion
Peace to all my shorties who be dying too young
Peace to both coasts and the land in between
Peace to your man if you're doing your thing
Peace to my peoples who is incarcerated
Asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it
Devouring, and towering over fools
Your mic is broke and my shit's cool
The black man with the understanding of
The three wise men and the theories of Zen
Yo, I get inside the crevice like a dentist
Disrupt, the block, like Dennis, the Menace
Shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble
Or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like Boggle
Bingo! That was the damn dog's name
But yo I know another one with much more fame
The Phife Dawg, and that's my word to the cipher
About to bring it to your chest and 'cause strife, check it out
You're doubling back to your rhyming pad
What I represent is MC's gone mad
In a perfect world there's imperfect acts
We've come like a guide to redirect alla that
So people with a gift can just flaunt and get money
So much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny
Money is invested in real estate and stocks
But not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops

[Consequence]
Yo, this the Cons to the Quence
Up in ya like a stiff one, nah'mean?
It's nine-five, you got to live it or rip it
So if you step on the streets keep it movin, nah'mean?

[Chorus][Intro: Jimi Hendrix & Q-Tip]
Rain all day
Rain all day
Don't you worry

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
All I wanna do is get down y'all
Have a ball y'all and freak freak y'all
Lifeless ventures ain't new boo
So don't boo hoo, yeah, you too
Gotta get a grip like culture
Swoop down, swoop down like a vulture
The rhythms will lurk into people
All funk ain't created equal
Lookin for the beat to rupture
Like the rapture, gotta capture
Don't let the storm of life scare ya
Get funky, let me prepare ya
For the days of grimness and oppression
Aiyo bro, here's your lesson
Even though the rain starts pourin
Start reachin, start soarin
Don't stop, if you do, you're stallin
Rhythm savior, hear ya callin
Instrumental to be freaky
Go ahead in the rain and you'll see

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Can't we make you see
I mean, the fact that is the key, I mean
Devoted to the arts of movin butts, so get on up and...
Think about what's yours
I mean your culture and your laws
I mean, I label you a sucka
If you're dumber, just stay dumber
But stay in line and keep groovin
If it's movin, if it's soothin
Don't let a little thing like rain keep you under
Or the thunder, look at wonder
Stomp til your soul is lifted
Get with it, rhythm's with it
Get inside the groove and get nasty
Funky nasty, crazy classy
Money is a first on the list here
It's the good time, it's the good cheer
If you got the ride then ride it
Don't hide it, provide it
Drop, drop, drop down the pants, shake your fanny
Cuz it's handy, not an Annie
Rock to the roll with the hair down
Get the lowdown, rhythm showdown
The simple explanation is nada
Make it hotter, thanks, de nada
If you wanna hear what I'm sayin
Clean your ears and just come on and groove[Hook]
"Oh my God!"

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
There's a million MCs that claim they want some
But see I create sounds that make your ears go numb
Peace to Sayres Ave., yeah you know how we go
My best friend Steven at the Home Depot
Laurelton is in the house, I can't forget Southside
Walk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde
I'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how
Act like you know, not now but right now
Beast of the East, on MCs I have a feast
I'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice
Straight outta Jamaica, seen? Jamaica, Queens
But you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between
Now if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good
If Malik don't look good, then Quest won't look good
If the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good
But since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good
Picture Phife losing a battle, come on, get off it
Put down the microphone son, surrender, forfeit
Did I hear something 'bout a crew? What they wanna do?
You better call Mr. Babyface so he can bring out the cool in you
Or it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton
And I'll dissect you like a fraction
Oh, you wannabe top cat MCs, I'll pop you like a zit
You wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit
Big up myself every time when it comes to this
MCs be running scared as if they're watching the Exorcist
I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead
My styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast-fed
You know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
I dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens
That goes for Onyx, LL, Run DMC
Akinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P
You need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other
Nuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover
Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I get the party jumping
Get on the mic and break 'em off a little little something
Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I gets the party jumping
Get on the mic my man and break 'em off a little something

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
We got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit
So recognize me, kids memorize me
Everyday, I be scrounging, really I be lounging
I play the down low, very very incognito
Aries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme
Sometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the honeys wiggle
Intellect is the major, some heads like to wager
The skills on the hill, overlooking dollar bills
Man, you're crazy, thinking you can phase me
The Ab doesn't study mere nonsense, money
Life seems to need me, MCs seem too cheesy
With their doody ass renditions of defeating competition
I rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man
Bet your bottom dollar Vinia will make you holler
As you stand at attention, did I forget to mention
MCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny
Lyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant
Just mentioning the fact that the area is fat
I dwell in the under, so honey it's no wonder
That I get plenty of tail, well I even get white
I'mma bet hitting head crack, there money, take that
Breaking niggas off, cut their bank, then I'm off
While my Nikes match my Lo hat, beat joint is mad fat
Got the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox
For tier means creator, the poetry relator
It's hemmed like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss

[Hook]

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Queens got a...
Brooklyn got a...
Bronx got a...
Staten Island got a...
Long Island got the zone
Jersey got a...
Philly got a...
Milwaukee got a...
L.A. got a...
Oaktown got the zone[Hook]
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Ay yo, Phife do you eat em? (No, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Again)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?) Nope
Not at all

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?
Some veggie links and some fish that stinks
Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house
Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
Eggs was fryin', ham was smellin'
In ten minutes, she started yellin' (Come and get it!)
And the gettin's were good
I said, "I shouldn't eat it", she said, "I think you should"
But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians
No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian
Strictly collard greens and the occasional steak
Goes on my plate
Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy
Candied yams inside my tummy
A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats
Apple sauce and some nice red beets
This is what we snack on when we're questin'
(No second guessin')

[Hook]
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Ay yo, Phife do you eat em? (No, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Again)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?) Nope
Not at all

[Q-Tip]
Bridge!

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings
The food that is the everlasting
See I'm not fasting
I'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey
Beef jerky, Slim Jims, I eat sometimes
I like lemons and limes
"And if not that, I get the Roti and the Soursop"
Sit back, relax, listen to some hip-hop

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Delectable delights, control my appetites
Mines is for me, right, but I know what I like
Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner
Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner
When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize
Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides
Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes
Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there
Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose
This is how it goes

I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
A yo, Phife do you eat em? (Nah, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Come again, y'all)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?)
Nope, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Afrika do you eat em? (No, Pos, do you eat em?)
Hell yeah, all the time
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Phife, do you eat em? (Nah, Tip, do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?)
Nope, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Afrika, do you eat em? (No, Gary, do you eat em?)
Yeah, all the time
(laughing)[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
The name is Q-Tip, enterin' through the middle
From the left, dead all the jokes and the riddles
Comin' from the maximum gain, the octane
That's on the radio it made me feel so low
It seems we gotta, brighten, the damp prison
I'm Nintendo 64 and you Mattel Intellivision
Bustin' from no mo' trey-eights, now papi weight
This joint is like a ruger, watch it roar like a cougar
And we gotta, move on the dancefloor
And work it out all night that's what you came here for
Just chem', I fills it to the rim, your shine is lookin dim
Daddy shine the light on him, ahem it's me
Leader of the starfleet force
Guaranteed to knock your joint off course, we took the loss?
Damn right, sure as tina made ike
We gonna put it in your noggin all night, and all day
The trilateral commision we dissin'
Tellin citizens be straight, but like snakes they hissin'
I'll be damned if I let his song fall to the side
Goin' piggybackin shit, let's ride, c'mon

I put it down, now what you gonna do (8x)
Hey, now, what you gonna do, with yourself, hah? (4x)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
When you hear this, recognize you hear love
MC nigga illin' over b-boy dubs
Riding through the shit like tron
Doesn't matter if you onboard, do you wanna get on?
Cause if you do, watch all the moves that we make
Gotta do the things right, ain't no time for mistake
It's the hip-hop cat that can't, fuck with Jake
Just because he wear a badge doesn't, mean he straight so
What you wanna swallow it down or let's take it
Disregard those who fake it, yo it doesn't matter
About the realm, hip-hop is to the helm
It's divine to hit the mind like slippery elms
So put it down man, put it on down
Put it down man, put it on down
Put it down woman, put it on down
Put it down man, put it on down
Put it down man, whatchu gonna do
Put it down woman, whatchu gonna do
A-put it down man, whatchu gonna do
Put it down woman, whatchu gonna do[Intro:]

Fuckin with the Diggy it don't, get no blacker
Malik Izaak Taylor, ey the stress reliever
Brown eyed shorty, chocolate like Godiva
Fuck what you heard I'll make YOU a believer

You never see her, cause she's the black like Sarafina
Set shit off like Latifah, single like Khadijah
So girls with fat asses and tits, nice to meet ya
Do five plus five equals ten? Ask your teacher
For God so loved the world he said Phife, ask your preacher
Love to toot my own Horne, similar to Lena
Before I take stage, I take sips of Aquafina
Fucked Judy Jetson, now they call me Jet Screamer
Love my coffee dark so you can keep your dairy creamer
Tribe fallin off, well youse a got damn dreamer

And we out like that, bump that[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Knew a girl named Shelley, six-pack belly
When we made love she made it shake like jelly
Put her own video star on my tele
Lived in the Bronx on the block named Fteley
Had to be jetty cause this other ho Netty
Kept blowing me up, her jonesing was steady
Told my man Louie that I really wasn't ready
Louie when we did it, man, we both got sweaty

[Phife]
This girl from my past had ridiculous ass
She attended UMASS and she passed every class
Walked down the hall with her stuck up sass
Talked to basketball players
She liked how they passed
But when I use to hit it, the bullcat she quit it
She wouldn't admit it but shorty was addicted
(Say Word) Word, nigga you heard
Like a fiend with a queen when he catches the bird

[Q-Tip]
Knowing how we living I'mma talk about Mayo
Sagittarian mami, her love was a KO
We was on the under, had to stay on the lay low
Used to go so deep that she used to say A-yo
Rocked with her friend but her friend drove both way
Asked her about it and she used to say no way
Just let it go yo, I used to say OK
Just another day but Phife, anyway

[Hook: Q-Tip]
I put it down man, what you gon' do
[Hook: Phife]
Well, I put it down son, what you gon' do
[Hook : Both]
We put it down for the area crew
All the shortys that's smoking y'all whoo
Looking good if you sipping on your brew
Come here ma, we make it hot for you
( the truth) Come here ma, we make it hot for you
(Ali Shaheed) Come here ma, we make it hot for you
Come on Phife

[Verse 2: Phife]
Met a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie
Body good and plenty, the finest in Missouri
If you had no money, you better hit the highway
Even in her own right, she had to do it her way

[Q-Tip]
It was an ill situation when I met Dantanya
Worked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor
Use to hit her man for cake to come see me
Her and her man from home, they sold heemey
We had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit
When I dug her yo she said I was the ultimate
Broke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner
All other things they did not concern her
People that we love yo, we love with a passion
I'm the type of cat that brings forth the action
You feeling me yo, I hope you hearing me yo
One more thing before you start cheering me yo

[Hook: Q-Tip]
I put it down man, what you gon' do
[Hook: Phife]
Well, I put it down son, what you gon' do

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Ayo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that vibe is non cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I’m not a man called Hawk, but I ain’t Mr. Softee
Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart
So forget the chart because the action can start

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Ha...where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk
I'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...

And I’m just sitting here waiting to get in something
I C U doin’ it, girl

And then I saw somebody that looked like you
When you was at the bar with the Heineken brew

Just watching you, doing my thing

[Verse 1: Q-Tip + Phife + both]
Kinda traditional, kinda rough
But the beat don’t deter me from your stuff
I mean, uh, I wonder if I get it enough
I’m an addict and dramatic, and I vote for your touch
It’s those things you do that got my head twist
Spontaneous, director of your own flick
Box office hit, strictly those cutting those trips
Theresa Randle type chicks, I call her ‘Girl 6’
Caramel complexion, Gucci Rush scent
Sexually intense, abstinence nonsense
Lights, camera, I’ll direct the action
Foreplay setting off her chemical reaction
Complete satisfaction, all around attraction
Go ahead and tell, ma, now don’t it feel relaxing? Woo
Now let me be the man in the canoe
That shy little guy who stroke right and pleases you
When it come to penetratin’ you, must variate you
Real estate agent, have to properly locate you
Same position and geographic place
Wanna, do the thing, show I appreciate

From the first day I saw ya, knew I had to bag ya
ESPN Zone, you were sipping on a lager
I’m way across the room and we made the eye contact
Had to say somethin’, consequences, nevermind that
I’m staring in your eyes, vision of locking lips
36D’s, damn, I love ‘em well equipped
AC on blast got you stroking some hard nips
Covering chick, it’s her I need to be with
She had a Midwest twang
Well, at least that’s how it sounded
3-1-7, representin’ out of town, kid
Only question now is: ‘How could I be down?’
It’s conventional to me because I really love her style, and

Forever my lady, you like how that sound?
Soca man am I, which we all lovin’ by the pound
‘Cause my name is Phife, girl, I’ll never leave your side

And this ain't on the pop tip yo
Are y'all kids tucked in?
(Yeah!)
Here we go..

[Q-Tip]
People in the audience they cry out "ho"
People with a gun, yo they'll cry out "bo!"
I don't like a cop, I don't sell a rock
But still the kanga's clock me after a show
Standing on the stage dripping, pouring with sweat
To people in the crowd I give what they get
Papers make paid, babies make laid
I don't really worry nor do I fret
Waiting for the gimme and boy I got some
Sweet like a peach and tart like a plum
I thought what I think, I rock a bead link
Legally I sip when I turn twenty-one
A letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome
The army wants me to drop my microphone
Gotta be brief, no orders from a chief
Hot butter on what, say what, the popcorn
On the tour bus we hit the truck stop
A dollar for some chips, a quarter for some pop
We laugh and giggle some, Phife gets the honeybuns
Ali Shaheed Muhammad keeps talking that shop
The brothers cruise on as we quest for the check
Calling up Famous to see if it's there yet
Not a bourgeoise, hate the seminar
Ignorant flip, hey miss you must jet
Flex for the funkiest, butts start to bounce
Measure Hip Hop for weight, by the ounce
Bush on the tush, you're pulling while I push
Play me for the punk then puss, feel the pounce

[Afrika Baby Bam]
A young baby brother growing up in the world
Used to be a bottle now a 40 and a girl
Standing on the corner cold chilling, talking shit
Wake up in the morning fix a plate of hominy grits
Change my diaper, clean my pacifier
Smoke to get higher if I would like to jump
Muhammad drum machining, dust it off clean and
Make a funky beat to keep the street steaming
Look from the heart and cold living lum
Good from the start like a newborn nun
Eat to get fatter, but that don't matter
Born out in Brooklyn and that's where I'm from
May 22nd out on Ocean Ave
From around the way so I be knowing the half
Peace to Sweet Daddy and on to Mike G
The harder they come is as hard as we be

If the papes come yo yo I won't riff
I'll just sit down and get me a spliff

Molecules of the land they uplift
Levels is straight, in fact they're rectified
Adrenaline now is crazy multiplied
Four and four is eight, if fat shit makes the plate
I make sure the Tribe is in
With the quickness you bear the witness
Flexing and pumping with the fitness
Moving it - uh, doing it - uh
Those who oppose must hit the s-list
Doing it, doing it with the whole frame
Look what's in the mind and not in the brain
On this you can quote, we on a diffy note
Quest for the future, 'stead of the fame
One ninety-one brothers grabbing they thingies
Forgot the name, oh, equivalent to Jimmy
Hiddle-iddle-it, you think I have to quit
Ali Shaheed Muhammad, with the singy-singy
Slamming with a slammy you front, on the case
Right or left nut Ali plays the ace
Do what you do, flam for a crew
Bonita Applebum blows smoke in Sha's face
Slang for the kang, you must if you have
Dribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so then picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El Segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said "Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?"
When he said “Why?: I said “We gotta go”
‘Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate ‘em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished, we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: “Pay for lunch,” so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
"Yo Tip man, you got what you need?"
I checked for keys and started to step
But what do you know, my wallet I forget

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Come on, let’s go

A milli, billi, dilli bum

A milli, billi, dilli bum
Come in, Mister DJ

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts, we scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming, three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, "All right, Tip, see you tomorrow”
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped’ to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said "Why?" I said "We gotta go
‘Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Come on, let's go[Intro: Girl #1 & (Girl #2)]
Hello?
(Hello, Theresa?)
Yeah, it's me
(Yo, what up kid?)
What's up?
(Yo, we going to this joint tonight?)
Word
(Word up, what you wearing?)
I don't know, I'll probably throw on my black leggings and my Tommy Hilfiger tee shirt, 'cause it's hot outside
(Word up, I'm feelin' my sun, to get jiggity with the fellas )
Word up
(Can you dig?)
Yeah, no doubt. I gotta look right for the nigga
(Ha, ya know what I'm sayin'? A'ight yo, I should go)
Yeah
(A'ight)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, & Consequence]
It was Friday afternoon in the middle of June
Heineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom
Around the time everybody just got home from class
Shooting dice, talkin shit, hoping the cash would last
Yo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better
Juney moved around in a tinted out Jetta

Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke
And I took one toke, yo, I almost choked
See I never smoked before so my nerves got shot
Then he told me about the party at the spot Jamroc
It was guaranteed on but I said "Son, chill"
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real
Word

He said we got all day, so we gonna do it right
Hit your man's joint first and Jamrock in one night
Then I said "Aight", then I hopped inside the jetty
Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty
I went upstairs to get fly, smoke my Thai
Drunk some liquor, to meet my high quicker
Now, I'm type stimo, the party is the M.O
Me and my crew, we get it started like a demo
Eleven in the evening, I'm feelin like a heathen
This thing is going down and I highly doubt I'm leaving
Booty cheeks are in motion and the kids was drinking potion
Word is bond, that Black Moon joint got me open
(Don't front)

Yo, the DJ flipped the script
Threw on the good shit that made the kid lose his grip
Blendin Risin to the Top and got these shorties hoppin
Number coppin', ain't no stoppin me now
Yo, I'm bound to win until that thing kicked in
The Alizé had me stuck, I don't know where to begin

[Verse 2: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, & Consequence]
Now I'm feeling kinda jaded, wild incoherent
Me and the fellas started acting irreverent
Butt grabbin, mad laughin, just assin
Then that chick caught up, the shorty looking fed up
They said you jonesin' with this one, gibbin' with that one
A yo, I'm just doing my thing, yo I'm just having fun
You don't see me in here wylin pulling out no gun
Yo, I see some of that thing girl and I want some
So let's step inside this corner so that we can rap on
Over this bumpin' ass song plus some Dom Perignon
I hit ya with the good lovin plus fillet mignon
Yeah, yeah scrammy scrams, that's that same old song
Aye yo, tell me why the hell your breath smells so strong
Yo, put some brakes on your yappin or you won't live long
Please nigga, push on
Alright scrams, see you later (scrams?)
Can't mess with these street sharks or these alligators
I can't take it no more, yo it's damn near four
I've been partyin and drinkin since I came out my door
Look at these kids about to mix it, damn, where's the exit?
Son, jetted to the ride and got the burner out the Lexus
Yo, he cocked his joint back like he's about to let him have it
Kid, I kept it movin like the Energizer rabbit
A yo yo, it's time to skate, ain't no time to contemplate
(all: Whoops, looka there, there's Jake)

[Outro: Skit]

[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]

[Q-Tip]
I can't have this no more. I've gotta find something new man[Chorus]
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

[Chorus]
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare
So jet to the store, and buy the LP
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
So the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
("What's, wrong?") Now check it out

[Outro: Q-Tip]
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
It's the Zulu nation[Intro: Q-Tip]
Woo...grand groove, grand groove
Woo...grand groove, grand groove

[Verse 1: Q-TIp]
Rough, rough, rugged
Tough like a nugget
Listen to The Abstract Poetic, don't snub it
The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
Don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky
I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
Upset when I rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes is smelly
See, I got it going on like a Forbes tax return
Listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
The skies up above, the one you think of
Is the highly regarded, hell of the people
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal (Word!)
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
That's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
I refuse to catch a 'L' in a battle
'Cause yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's ass
Into little next to nuthin'
Test me if I'm frontin'
I'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, I am that brotha that can rock

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
We've got the jazz, we've got the jazz, come on
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
We've got the jazz
Come on, come on, Phife

[Verse 2: Phife]
No need for introductions 'cause you know who I be
(The Phife Dawg) Yep, the one who loves to slaugher MC's
I got style, grace and razamatazz
I'm like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo, I add pizzazz, now
Most people remember Phife from the Phife like smoothness
But now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
I'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
The first punk that tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw
I'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
Don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
I'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a fat invite
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep
'Cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?
But beatin' on a girl, is somethin' that a puss' would do
I love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid
Not really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Come on
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
We got the jazz, we got the jazz, come on

[Outro: Q-Tip]
I go...woo..., ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, grand groove, grand groove
Yeah, and it's the beat
Ah baby, ah baby, ah baby, ah baby
Go ooh...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...grand groove, grand groove
Yeah, and it's the beat
Check it out
We got the jazz, y'all
We got the jazz, y'all

Tear it up, y'all
1, 2, y'all
Tear it up, y'all
We got the jazz, y'all
Check it out, y'all
(ad lib)[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Somethin' for your earhole, so you can clean them shits out
It seems that some don't understand what I'm talkin' about
How you get West Coast nigga, from West Coast hater?
I could never dis a whole coast, my time is too greater(true)
Yeah, we from the East, the land of originators
You also from the West, the land of innovators
The only difference of the two is the style of the rap
Plus the musical track, this beef shit is so wack
Let me let y'all brothas know I ain't no West Coast disser
Another thing I'm not is a damn ass kisser
So listen to my words as I set things straight
I ain't got no beef, so don't come in my face

[Chorus]
Keep it movin', yeah to the K.I.M
Keep it movin', yeah yeah to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin'
Keep it movin', keep it movin', yeah yeah to the K.I.M
Keep it movin', yeah yeah to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin'

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Hip-hop can never be a way of life
It doesn't tell you how to raise a child or treat a wife
I verbalize over...rhyme friendly
That puts a listener in a frenzy, so pop me in your Benzi
You dig it? Get wit it or get your melon splitted
If you ever try to combat, Sirat al-Mustaqim
We got the illy team that doesn't even sweat the gleam
Or glamour, we'll Figure 4 your ass like Greg the Hammer
Man, we rockin' joints like The Who or Santana
Keep jams packed and hotter than Havana
Positivity is the key in the lock
Put your hand on it, turn it to the right, akh
We doin' daredevil dandies on these mics
Peace out to the whole Hiero who's puffin on the hydro
Yeah dun, we movin' how we like
Since the days of rockin' hi-lows, we keepin' things on pyro, fire
As we move with zeal and desire
Now, the hip-hop plan, hope you compiler
Son, we havin' tunnel vision but my sight is real real broad
Cuz I can't afford to miss that call
Makin moves, not movies, as get on the ball
And we keepin' things covered like a female shawl
When I watch hockey, yo, I just look for the brawl
Quest, Quest and you know we signin' out y'all

[Chorus]
Keep it movin', yeah to the K.I.M
Keep it movin', yeah yeah to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin'
Keep it movin', keep it movin', yeah yeah to the K.I.M
Keep it movin', true that to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin'

Muhammad, uh, you know we do it up (fading out)[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
A-yo swing swing swing, to chop chop chop
Yo that's the sound when MC's get mopped
Don't come around town without the hip in your hop
Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped
MC's wanna attack me but them punks can't cope
I'll have you left without a job, like Isaac from The Love Boat
So money watch your mouth, or I'mma have to bust ya
Battling MC's, from JFK to Russia
Back down to London, Sweden and Brazil
Do a U.S. tour for three months and then I chill
Styles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney
"I love you, you love me"
The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC
So move back yaself dread, you know the element
The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutrament
MC's don't have no wins, MC's don't have no (bitches)
I flip shit crazier than a busload full of Jerry's Kids
Your crew don't want it and your crew don't want it
But if you feel you can swing it, then money please bring it
Large Professor in the house, you know how we do
I skate on your crew, like Mario Lemieux
Peace to Ike Love and the rest of the crew
I'll meet you guys in front the cleaners, bring the blunts and the brew so...

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Whassup kids? The Ab is speaking from the moon
Thanks for your support, a-yo I'll be home soon
But the only thing I ask when I return from my task
Is a whole bunch of beats and a flask full of ass
My fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards
C'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy
I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy
She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty
When we over joints like this we never cruddy
Extra P hooked the beat, and kid that feels luh-ove-ly
Check it out, cause my conception is immaculate
A bachelor, looking for a bachlelorette
Back to you MC's, this is what you're gonna get
A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Malboro
Paul, you know we thorough like Denver
The beat feels like a never-ender
But all things good must, so I won't sweat it
Drop the seeds for the youthful crew, I hope you get it
As I stand, grip this mic inside my hand
Boy I smack you up, like I was your old grand
So respect yourself Son, and come and gimme love
Once again the Ab is who you think of
So chill with the beef money, we gotta dead it

[Verse 3: Large Professor]
It's Extra P and yo Tip I'm bout to set it
On the country once again here to win
I'm Uptown chilling, taking in this Grandmaster Vic blend
From the projects, the PJ's, fuck them two DJs
Self mission, I had her in the ill position saying
"Large you's the soul brother that I'd like to eff with for the rest of my life"
Yeah yeah now check the method
As I, proceed with what you need like Akinyele
A whip looks complete when the tires say Pirelli
Funk monkey, one rapper fell off, now he's a junkie
There's 8 million stories in the city it's a pity
Don't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty
Big shout to the Guru, Primo and Zulu
Nation, was on a vacation, in the ghetto
Yo Ras slow your roll I'm bout to bag this schmeydl
Rapper Nas on top it seems we gonna rock it
Queens represent, buy the album when I drop it[Verse 1: André 3000]
I ain't even gon' lie, I was probably high
Just forgot to call you back, simple as that
I ain't no almanac, so lick my dictionary
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary
Yellow accents on a dark bitch
I met her back when she kept all her carpet
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B
That's demeanor, momma's mannerisms
That mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts
It's cold out in this bitch, standing on the corner
Condolences to niggas that got erased
I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave
Mmm, digital church bells
Ringin' 'cross the street, sure work well

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I don't wanna get up now, I don't wanna go to school
I don't wanna be the best, don't wanna follow rules
Mom, I think you fuckin' lied to me
Three stacks said all this shit is fantasy
It's my time, gon' put a little life to it
If life's a obstacle then I'mma bike through it
I see it like a kiddie on the carousel
If I 'url while I go around, what the hell
And that went well, so I'm compelled
To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel
My young nigga motto was, "Fuck it, I'm already grown"
And I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home
That petty though, 'cause my mama boyfriend dough
It's kinda long like this old head hustle, yo
He cognizant of a nigga ride and die
I see us getting money through my green eyes

[Verse 3: André 3000 & Q-Tip]
Yeah, all the kids, all the what, uh
Yeah, all the badass kids, uh
Kids, say I'm the shit
I'm Chick-fil-A nuggets, McDonald's french fries
The spicy Popeye's and Red Lobster biscuits
And girls scout thin mints
Pardon my penmanship, but oh shit
Feel like I'm hungry now again
And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted
And my mom and my pop, they just grin
And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens
Them grown-up stories don't work
In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids
Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up
They stood on the corner
Like you once upon a, time
And probably felt like a loner
And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning
Complaining that you always moaning
Never saying good morning
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too, though
They were kids like you, though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court
With no high percentage shot
Just a bunch of, "You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got"
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?
They don't play no more, probably

We was in the back of the joint cooling out
And I saw this girl, asked her if she like it like that
Nod her head yes, therefore I didn't stress
Let my beat keep knocking cause we rock it like that
Bust your ass slow, as if you didn't know
Put my mic inside your brain zone, don't dis home dis
It's the rhyme, it's the beat that vibe all together
That makes the competitors sound like this
Really do I care yo, I let down my hair
When the music's up loud man, I jones real bad
Lyric overload, in club, in the go
In jeep in America, tribe go mad
Females ride when my niggas just ride
With the songs we creating and musically relating
Sex niggas talk, my body's in chalk
Meanwhile they boot shaking
On some punk shit faking
Wait, I can't front, stick men
Here's a few who really come to do
What they say gonna do
Back at the ranch
There's no Carte Blanche
Everybody gonna move when we say move

[Hook]
Do you like it?
Say yeah if you like it like that (YEAH)
Do you like it?
Hell yeah if you like it like that (HELL YEAH)
Do you like it?
Tell me if you like it like that (YEAH)
Do you like it?
Verse two if you like it like that (COME ON)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Who could be the one
Rhyming ill, having fun
Blowing up, making musical memories and things
Elevate your thoughts on the vibe that we brought
While we climbing & we shine like a super bowl ring
You could do it too
I mean hop like we do
Interlock like we do and make your own mark
It's deeper than the song
Hope you live your life long
When you win, how you start, kid you gotta have heart
Niggas in my shit, move
Give a nigga room
Back it up, it's a grown man making on time
Plus you damn similar to Newport's
Smoking ain't a new sport
Smoke you since the invent of rhyme
Gotta spread love, no matter where you are
Where you at, where you went
Cause nobody want beef
Fountain is good, just flows like a river
Just go with a nigga, kid my stay ain't brief
Put your heart in the day, in the night, family enemies but yo I
Really don't wet that
We was in the back of the joint cooling out
And saw this girl
Asked if her if she like it like that, yo
You like it that (repeat till fade)[Intro: Q-Tip]
Yeah, Phife—for your life

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Now, in the time when niggas wasn’t supposed to be born
Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn
Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass
Just for running through their lawn
Walt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt
Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt
Love was consummated and the angels registrated
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it
Inside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy
It’s a bouncing baby boy, a king’s name they would employ
And before he even squeaks, it’s decided it’s Malik
Now give him hope, give him care
Raise him while his grandma there
Watch out momma, if you stare
Light brown eyes'll keep you there
Let’s progress the story just a little bit
Malik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits
Sometimes overbearing though I thought it was for your benefit
Despite all the spats and shits cinematically documented
The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended
Rhymes we would write it out, hard times fight it out
Gave grace face to face, made it right
And now you riding out, out, out, out, damn

[Chorus: Cat]
Have you ever loved somebody?
(Phife dawg, man)
Way before you got to dream?
(Bow wow, woof woof)
No more crying, he’s in sunshine

[Verse 2: Jarobi]
Never thought that I would be ever writing this song
Hold friends tight, never know when those people are gone
So, so beautiful, opined indisputable
Heart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude
Took me quick to granny house, now we eat the curry food
Talking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared
Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of sairs
Mailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there
A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn’t care
Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear
I’mma flash forward well, took a trip to ATL
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well
Wedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I’m at
Standing on the side of black Malik Izaak

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying, he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now, see his wings
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying, he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now, see his wings
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying, he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now, see his wings
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying, he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now, see his wings
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more cry

[Guitar Solo: Jack White][Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!

[Break: Lucien]
- What? Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man?
I though he was a friend, yo
Oh man, can't believe that
Oh, why you do that to me?
I [?] like this
I can do it by myself
Yo, it's [?]

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Are you ready, Lu? This one is for you
Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe
"¿Cómo está usted?" or "Comment allez-vous"
Lucien, I'll leave it up to you
Voulez-vous? (vous)
Rendez-vous (vous)
Coucou (cou)
Les poupous (pou)
Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast
Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip?
Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'
VCR from a neck-bone bummin'
$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'
Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
Figure it out, compute, understand
No problemo, I'll help you with your demo
If you go to the store for me
Lucien, I'm just kiddin'
You should know!

[Break: Lucien]
- Hey, yo, wassup' man? What's your name?
- What kind of accent is that?
- It's a french accent, you know, I'm french, I'm from Paris, don't you think it's sexy?
- No, it's not a sexy accent
- Oh, man ! Give me a try ! You try to kiss me enough? Hun? Oh please what! Love me french, french me love, everybody love my accent! Why nobody like it? Q-Tip [?] city of Paris. Why is that? Oh! I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French "savoir faire" and the sexy glance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!

[Break: Lucien]
Oh Tip, everything, you gonna be alright, man
Thank you [?], man
I think I'll going home, man
Bye-bye, I'll see you tonight
Oh Tip, [?], I'm not here[Hook: Q-Tip]

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Goin on and on to the rhythmic variation
Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation
Decaptatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason (c'mon)
Makin all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go

[Hook]
(I got lyrics to go) It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
Lyrics to go It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
(Lyrics to go) It's like that

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin
Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin
Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme)
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? (mmm)
This I dedicate to all the honeys that be bogle-in
Cause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go

Check it out y'all

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uhh)
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin
Never will that happen only if it is permitted (uhh)
Wait... I think somebody shitted (c'mon)
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings
Always try to lead yo never will I follow
Blowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
And when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go

Check it out y'all
(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all
I got lyrics to go Everybody

I said I rarely dream in color but (they don't know)
And every brother ain't a brother but (they don't know)
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)
To give her everything's my dying wish (they don't know)
Role play, she plays the mannequin (they don't know)
Raising my hand, teacher says "Not again" (they don't know)
The sun is up, but I feel down again (they don't know)
On just one hand, I can count all my friends (they don't know)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
The understudy for the star, the show must go on
I'm a beast on a leash, I'm towed from the lawn
Another notch in my belt, the food's getting scarce
Another notch in my belt, she shakes up the stairs
Drink liquid confidence, tequila's our defense
Get rid of this tense and makes life make sense
As I come off the fence and break through defense
Anxiety is on the ropes and it's gettin' intense

[Refrain 2: Q-Tip]
Population gettin' tired now (they don't know)
Everybody wants inspired now (they don't know)
Racist emails fire out (they don't know)
We did it in the dark, it's coming out (they don't know)
The world is crazy and I cannot sleep but (they don't know)
Melatonin good enough to eat but (they don't know)
I read the paper so that I can see what (they don't know)
I'd rather stay indoors and make a beat but (they don't know)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
My mother said a lot of wise words to me
Her Bible was like her toolie, peasy-headed and unruly
I made her think she got to me
Following the trail of reefer
And niggas talking through speakers
Fattest laces through my sneakers
The rappers ere ghetto preachers
Thought I had it so I tried it, for so long I would just hide it
Then I made the crowds say "Hoo!"
And saw them all get excited
I was hooked, I couldn't shake it
The more I got, I would take it
Couldn't sleep andcouldn't eat
But this life, I would not forsake it

[Refrain 3: Q-Tip]
I said I really dream in color now (they don't know)
And every brother ain't a brother now (they don't know)
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)
To give her everything my dying wish (they don't know)

[Chorus: Abbey Smith]
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one

[Outro: Q-Tip]
This one's for good girls that all gone bad (just one)
This one I'm taking when I feel sad (just one, yeah)
This one I'm taking to make me strong (just one)
This one I'm taking so that I'll live long (just one, yeah)
This one I'm taking to make me smile (just one)
This one I'm taking to make life worthwhile (just one)
This one and that one and those and these (just one)
I just want to sleep, I want to be at ease (just one)[Hook: Q-Tip]
The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But the night is on my mind
So parlay while I drop this rhyme

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
See, Jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark
He be coming out for heads but shit don't let me start
There's activities a-plenty in the nighttime
For the ghetto child it seem to be the right time
See, kids be getting stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Running to the corner, the dice game is blazing
Looking at the loot, it seems so amazing
Puts the short down, to be exact one pound
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down
Scared money don't make none
He threw a trip on the ace now he's out son
Hits the local bodega to wolf down a hero
Son is on a midnight run like De Niro
Spots a shorty rock standing on his block
The fiends be hounding him to pump, so he adds to his knot
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Increased intensity, cause damn she was a fly one
Took her to the crib there she ran her jibs
About mind upliftment and being positive
He yawned and he sighed til 1:05
Then he finally realized that honey wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on building for the evening
Threw the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leaving'
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand
(Ah sh...) You know the transaction
Brothers gettin lost in the weed satisfaction
Coming down the block man loud as (fuck)
You would swear Redman was inside the truck
As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt
They interrupt your cipher, and crush your blunt
See you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothing
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep fronting
You push to the park even though it's still dark
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot you troop'

[Hook]
The night is on my mind
The sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
The night is on yo mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind

[Verse 2]
As for me I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates
On a young black man who makes the niggas speakers shake
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy
It's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the Jake can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
And the stars dance around, a-yo I think it's fly
Intensity, most rappers don't see it
Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it
Serenity and silence of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle when the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel
But let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough

[Hook]
The night is on my mind
The sun’ll still shine
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind
Yeah, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on my mind
Uh-huh, the night is on my mind
The night is on yo mind
You know the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
Yeah, the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
Yeah, the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine

Did you know that the rate of AIDS in the Black and Hispanic community is rising at an alarming rate?
Education is proper means for slowing it down[Intro: Laurel Dann]
Hello, this is your Midnight Marauder program
I am on the front of your cover
I will be enhancing your cassettes and CDs with certain facts that you may find beneficial
The average bounce meter for your Midnight Marauder program will be in the area of 95 BPM
We hope that you will find our presentation precise, bass heavy, and just right
Thanks[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Your new lesson is to realize the mission when you hear it
Emceein, see I got this in my spirit
I got verses like Mahalia singin' church hymns
So strap up because you skatin' on ice that's wild thin
A weak foundation doesn't make a good home
That's why mine is built on chrome microphones
We bout to do it theoretically, unsteadily, to the medley
Come on
It's the complete Kamaal, unique, Fareed, breed
That'll keep you broke down like a Ross 5 speed
So move buddy, a yo we got to get this money
In this land of dead and crummy, ain't a damn thing funny
A yo, shout out to Mobb Deep, the Extra P
Busta Rhymes, De La, the J Beez, and don't sleep
We got reality for the cabbage
Staying sincere to this, so I know we gonna manage
Give me, liberty in mass amounts and Swiss bank accounts
With the sustainer, it'll be real
So me and my brothas, we can sit down and build
Like Rampage with that Last Boy Scout appeal
We got that silk, satin, Manhattan intelligence feel
That keeps everything on even keels
So all you slow brothas talkin' yang, ya poo-tang
Now, we gonna show you how the real crew bang

[Verse 2: Consequence]
A yo, I bring it to you live kid, Queens niggas love static
Your rap's had it, braggin' more numbers than mathematics
I get brains on Craftmatics and leave your wet dreams shattered
That's the same guy be skeetin' in your mugshot
I stay hot like summertime on LBQ and boo-boos
The love shack is 1-9-2, my joint's smooth
To watch y'all niggas fall like Lin Que
I keep it brand new like school shoppin', it's on and poppin'
The club peeps this nigga's steez like radars
You get laid off while I'll be gaming ghetto girl like 8-Off
The verdict's in, I be the Luke of Linden
Give up your goods cuz it's the start of your endin'

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
(Where ya at?) We seein' life for what it is
(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation
(Where ya at?)

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Now, all that Glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail
It's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail
I keep it realer than the logo on milk
Denouncing tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk
That's the sound of the man getting yanked off the stage
Trying to front like he mad paid
Sucking so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)
MCs are just givin' it all away (OK)
Who said him know about the Quest-like sound?
Mess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)
I dedicate this to the posers that play hard
You wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard
So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display
Leaving all MCs in complete disarray
I beez a veteran MC, crushing crews for years
You frontin' hard when you softer than the Berenstain Bears
Yeah, chumps be like "Phife, that ain't fair"
'Fuck outta here, do I look like I care?
Come off my stage before I grab ya neck and handle ya
Wet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada
Shaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer
Peace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers
I'm cappin' hard cuz I got this rap shit sold
From Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road
You know my steez, I treat hip-hop like a sport
Holdin' down fort up on Martinique Court like...

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
(Where ya at?) We seein' life for what it is
(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation
(Where ya at?) We gonna start the Zulu Nation
(Where ya at?) Come on, come on
(Where ya at?) We gonna put it all together
(Where ya at?) No matter what the hell the weather
(Where ya at?)

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Uh, uh, mind power
Uh, uh, mind power
Uh, uh, mind power
Uh, uh, mind power
Uh, uh, mind power
Uh, uh, kickin' willie is good, all throughout your whole hood
But we gotta start with the spirit first y'all
Mind power[Verse 1: Consequence]
I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Dream about Bugattis and other four-wheels
They say Illuminati and other ordeals
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar
I should probably get awards where the Emmys are
For how I deal with the pap like Remy Ma
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now
But don't confuse how you see me have to move now
I got bars like a cypher's in the booth now
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
'Long as they get my page right on Wikipedia
'Long as they say my name right in the media
If you don't, that's a sin like Cincinnati
'Cause ever since I had the polo suit at the Grammys
I been spittin' at the camera like Trick Daddy
So swaggy, he could've broke up with IG
I ain't surprised that they broke up on IG
I got the game on IV, might as well have a live feed
Keep a fresh cut from IB
So I always match the picture in my ID
They packin' Dub C had ran with Mack 10
I was still a baby Similac then
And what the crack era did to black men
It had to be an error if you had a Cadillac then

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
How I rock mine, I throw it up
Makin' sure that you niggas all are on the same page
Powerful force, you better look both ways
Fuck that, I'm chokin' niggas, it's goin' down
I'm from a different cloth, we the oracles of the sounds
Skip town, hit 'em with impeccable pound
Lost, found, the way I flood it, niggas gon' drown
Rip shit—ayo, wait, wait, wait, wait—
I gotta do it again, I gotta do it again
You already know the script, roundhouse kick
She lookin' at me, lickin' her lip
Put my arm around her like a bowl of chip with a dip
With yo' bitch, what the fuck, niggas erupt
I got the half moon clip, that's banana
A good planner, a new anger like a larger Bruce Banner
Out the house, nigga, if you open your mouth
Man, nigga, if you open your mouth
Fuck the press, I'm leavin' every room in a mess
Like herds of bulls with they aprons on and bakin' soda
Keep it movin', keep the convo short
And bring a case of Henney (case of Henney)
House of pain, I control many (control many)
House of lies, you niggas go run, hide
Peep the way this vibe conflict with they real lives
(Nigga) Fanatic shit, we go bizarre (we go bizarre)
Bad news for niggas as I go emphatical, radical
National animal rulin' like a czar
Every time I black for the record, the shit splatter
The whole batter, no bullshit, the boom bapper
I pull the gat up, whip the shit, cook the batter
When I pull up on niggas, even your momma gon' scatter
Barishkaaa[Intro]
This is the Lone Ranger
If you're one of the fortunate to purchase this
A Tribe Called Quest, The Love Movement album
You are privileged to witness the first in a series of attempts
To rectify music from its rectalness
Again, this is the Lone Ranger with his first installment
Money Maker
Listen

Colder in the winter
And hotter in the summer
Get on up
Get on up
Live your life right when you be corrupt
Volcano about to erupt
Get it up, Get it up, Get it up

Got the motivating joints that keep your ass jumping
Why when a nigga get on, you want something
Yo I got the poisonous traps for little rats that fiend
In come the bedroom, Dream
Kick it at a slow or at a quick tempo
A ladies' disposition won't fuck with the mental
I'm built for conflicts with chicks with issues
I can lick the wounds, bring ease when misused
Bringin' all the pain and makin' things shiver
The beat make you bite your nails and shit your liver
And we gonna give a encore performance
Haters seem dormant while my presence is enormous
Tarnations, I went Gold
Stressed Out with Faith but told cats to Get a Hold
Who is the nigga who's mic is stronger
Rock for an hour and he might rock longer
Kid you're perplexed, seems I better get to gongin'
The clean up man, hang you up like awning
Don't step in the arena, that's a stern warning
I'm the pops, I raise the sun like morning
Seems you're still sleeping, hey, stop the yawning
Open up the blinds and witness the dawning
The new application and I'm the applier
And I'm a set it off like fire
Yeah yeah, that's where it's at
Make it hot and phat and like Puff (I like that)
Now I got to urge you on to move ahead
Don't dread, 'cause I keep the stock in the shed
And if you need a boost, then I got the jump
Because we prone to make the party go bump bump bump bump bump bump bump where you is
If you the baby daddy then uplift the kids
Get back and plan, don't be on front flossin'
Incognito, you heard the name quite often
You dressed in black and been issued a coffin
I thrive on this plane, you off to the lost one
Like cayenne pepper, it gets hot, nothin' better
From each little dash it get the whole smash
It's tasty too, so satisfy your whole palate
Fake ID's are revoked and invalid
Infractin' bodies out on the dance floor
Is what I wanna see, not less but much more
The lyrics just spewed, he got good reviews
The kid made the news, how he left no clues
On how he just murdalized the whole damn jam
He just got results that's smiles and waved hands
The mission could never be accomplished, however
Until we bounce to an island with hot weather
And still we'll be able to rock and rip crowds
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud
If you with the Tribe, chest out and be proud

Shake your money maker
Shake your money maker
Shake your money maker
Shake it, shake it
(Repeated 5X with variations)[Chorus]
We be the number one motivators
Ghetto mentality and the innovators
Some of y'all may really hate us
But we won't be soft, all we wanna do is rock

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
We be the crew that presents to the wicked instrumental
Damaging your mental from here to Sacramento
This here groove was made for vintage freestyling
Feeling like I'm chilling on a Caribbean island
Rugged raw material is what we bring forth
A Tribe Called Quest, we representing up North
Quence got you taken in the back, acting all silly
Kicking freestyle raps, rolling up Phillies

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
It's the four man fiasco in charge like Roscoe
Now you get the picture like Picasso
We make it happen when these niggas start rapping
Who this, captain?
Stick out your hand, you gets no dap and
I got the Razor, got the Phife, I got the Shaheed
Now all you shorties move your ass while you puff weed
Blessing fans with autographs in my paths
While other rappers get gassed, they be defeating the task

[Verse 3: Consequence]
Yo, if I ruled the world
It wouldn't be that gassed shit, niggas will mix it like swirl
'Cause half of you G's, ain't nothing but girl scouts
And I'mma show you what it's all about
(Ah yeah!) That's what you say when my love's in your mouth
Without a doubt I cut MCs like the cord
'Cause I does more than that MC from The Lords
While you be frogging like Bud-wei-ser
And rapping is what you slacking in
I'm knocking MCs outta action like abstinence
Rockin' since Kiss My Dick was kicking that Peachfuzz
Cuz, you might be on drugs

[Chorus]
We be the number one motivators
Ghetto mentality and the innovators
Some of y'all may really hate us
But we won't be soft, all we wanna do is rock

[Post-Chorus: Q-Tip]
To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate
Motivate, I motivate
To all my people across the land who get their feet stuck in sand
Motivate, I motivate y'all

[Verse 4: Consequence]
A yo, I stay with something new but not Granddaddy I.U
Stay tuned, live from the L-B-Q
A yo, it's just the same guy, swinging on your block
You know how I get down like Heather B with them Glocks
I came to lead my team to victory like Hayden Fox
'Cause heads ain't ready for the willie I got
Ya nah'mean slim, I does my Thing like Ben Grimm
Leaving crews in state of black and blue like Rakim
And if you don't know, you better ask another
It's like 1-9-2 when we rolling deep cover
So don't shut down on the Razor
Cuz in the 9-Live we stepping through hotter than the Trail Blazers
And in Queens, I be a legend like Richard Dean
Son, I gotta team that Hakeem couldn't dream
While you be Sam Cassell'n, Queens keep it live
Who the hell you telling? (Can't front on the Tribe)

[Verse 5: Phife Dawg & (Q-Tip)]
Let me tell you why I be the top dog in the industry
Because all these so-called mutts are not seeing me
They too busy eating cycles 1, 2 and 3
They can't MC, I'd rather be down with fucking Droopy D
My style is deadly, word bond, act like you fucking know
Been writing rhymes ever since Ray Parker sang with Raydio
Your style is played out like a two-tone down goose
You couldn't Converse if you had fucking react juice
So hold your corner as I start to bless this mic in here
I'm eating through your crew like Stephen King's Langoliers
Try bite my steez, word to God, I'm gonna hurt you
(Will y'all fall off?) Will Laura fuck Urkel? Never
Here comes the funk, smell the aroma
Kid, my shit's the bomb, ask my peeps in Oklahoma

[Outro: Q-Tip]
To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate
Motivate, I motivate, I motivate y'all
To all my people across the land who get stuck in great sand
Motivate, I motivate y'all
To all my peoples everywhere throw your mitts in the air
Motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate
Can't do nuthin for your fronting, get involved and do something
Motivate, motivate, I motivate, I motivate, I moti...[Verse 1: Jarobi]
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand
Asphalt jumpin', junkie lyrical, concrete
My Jedi mind be moving me
Throughout the many dark streets
Backwoods, boondocks, whatever terrain
Auf Wiedersehen, Aloha, man our feet ain't the same
I won't abuse these shoes, these shoes ain't made for reversing
Then trudging through these motherfuckers' first album Footprinting, never ever ghostwritten, yo' shit free, bitten
Grab my shit with both hands, iron grip, steel mitten
Bloviated, Jarobi ate it and now it's gone
Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead
To my hustlers with customers, scam my chicks just being petty
Trap lords with the fetty, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
Don't do it, nigga

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I spun around without a care
When I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere
When I stopped, I felt lost
Do you ever feel lost?

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
They wanna see my downfall
Turn a good day into a downpour
Thorns in the crown hit the cross I bear
Why they wanna see me hangin' like a towel somewhere
One eye, two bills, three tears, a heart still
How I'm feelin' in my mind right here
Think I'm moving, I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Maybe why I feel lost, yeah
How I'm 'posed to know how home feels?
I ain’t even on my home field
And again I feel lost
Was not a cruise that brought us here, again I feel lost
And I refuse to be stuck right here, yeah
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me directions?
I don't want to move backwards, no

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Moving backwards never, that was never the plan
Can I vent? I was content being my own man
Up until that night ill-fated, walking home I was faded
Po puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands
How demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism?
Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism
Instead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom
He'll make it out of the jungle some way
Hey, it's figurative, not a real place you stay
Ay, it's mind state filled with muck and malaise
Uh, I got direction without using Waze
Submitting myself to praying these days
Yeah, moonwalking backwards, it's only for stage

[Verse 4: Anderson .Paak & (Q-Tip & Anderson .Paak)]
Feds lining up, in riot gear
And everybody's hands in the air
Four-five so get your ass found somewhere
Caught between hope and despair
Say it loud, what it take to make my niggas listen
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Cool out, chill out nigga, I'm cool
Cool out nigga, nah, nigga I'm through
Head down, ain't no tellin' what you gon' do
(Somebody just give me—
Somebody just give me—
Somebody just give me direction
I don't want to move backwards, no
Cops killing us niggas everywhere
Maybe we should get some guns too)
She come around every now and a few
(Man, I hope she really loves you)
Living high ain't hard to do
(She'll be in the clouds somewhere
Feeling fresh, I strut your bitches out of here
Might even take your broad too
Oops, I'm 'bout to get kicked out here
Tell mama I'mma slide through)
Stealer, I'm trying to get out of here
But stuck up in the same room
(Too many open miles in here
Sick of eating out at drive through)

[Outro]
Hahaha, look at this motherfucker[Hook 12X: Ali Shaheed Muhammad]
Mr. Incognito, Incognito

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mr. Incognito is back again
Now all I want is peace and papes, and a physical friend
Jottin down my list of positives in life
I want a ride, crib, mutt, wife
The look on my grill is filled with conviction
Gonna get what I need, delete restriction
Babble on the boulevard to brother hood buddies
Pokin in my pocket it's the E for the moneys
Jay and all the jokes that jet in the Jettas
While I'm at the boob tube watchin Baretta
Swig up on a forty cause I'm feelin thirsty
Mama says she taught me, better say she cursed me
Throwin on my hoodie, low-profilin
Wassup with the Tipster? Brotherman be wylin
But I be on mission that's beyond eye level
Questin out the devil and his pals that are several
Quest with the Questers or Quest on a solo
Boomin in a Benzo, Beamer or a Bronco
Boom caca a boom boom, boom caca a boom
If my sight isn't seen, silly saps will assume
That we fallin off the Earth with the Nina and the Pinta
The Five Foot Assassin with the shade of magenta

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Magenta is the shade for the mystic parade
Physical Trini born, lyrically, I am swayed
Livin off Linden, 1-92nd
Chillin at the rest, other brothers wreck it
Easy like a morning, Commodore Sunday
Waited for a Tuesday, for manic Monday
When I woke Wednesday, persons was poundin
Don't know the whereabouts, can't be foundin
Feelin' for the feelin' for the one they call the Phifer
Still on the smooth but a tidbit hyper
Get with the get on as I hit the D-L
It's my thing what I bring, I try to do it well
You can bet your bottom dollar that the Tribe will not be slippin
Makin hit after hit as we commence to start rippin
People think I'm buggin or I have the heebiejeebies
The reason they can't find me is because they can't see me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
It's like the war's going on in the middle of your mind
But your mind can't contain Incognito's on the brain
So you chill by yourself
Don't really sweat nobody
Speak to all the brothers and say peace to every hottie
But lurking in the ghetto is a germ that insists
Should you back the germ away? Or utilize your fists
Neither of the two, just continue with your thoughts
And wash away your pain with the power of the quart
Ain't got no time for girls, 'cause girls be on some bull
Checkin for a nigga who got crazy pull
On some deep-rooted sexual, highly intellectual
Not checking for the fame although it's perpetual
I entered the world the same way I'll exit
If you really dig the groove, then hey, glad you checked it
'Cause Incognito's strong, not irking like a blister
Before you speak about me, make sure you call me Mister

[Hook][Intro: Q-Tip]
Dip dip dive, to the socialized
Issued rhythms that are on the rise
Step right up, with an opened circuit
Get this current, don't you know it's worth it
Presented with, Tribe-centricity
Compared, don't you know? Vibe electricity
Strong like a bomb, quick like a comet
Can I get whatever from Mr. Muhammad?

*Ali scratches interlude*

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
If Muhammad has the breaks, who will have the backs?
Bodies set it up all flow to rhythm stack
Okay I see my brother (huh), you know what we can do (what?)
Cruise with the rhythms (hah), Shaheed will lead us to (yeah)
Posin with the hotties (huh), harder than the hard (hard)
Still Muhammad plays with a full deck of cards (card)
The Tribe's stuff is present (yeah), established with the beat (beat)
We roll around on wheels (huh) or utilize the feet (feet)
Go and keep progressin (huh), egos of the Tribe (Tribe)
If we have to swing it (uhh) we won't take a dive (dive)
Comprende my compadre? (Yeah) Kid you want some more? (Yeah)
Muhammad push the button (huh), sample sing the score (ho)

Brothers try to pose, up with the Tribesmen
Rhythm on your toes, yes it's the funk again
Appreciate the flow, denounce the circuit breakers
Do it with the best, the movers and the shakers
Bustin out your heap, ??? my vehicle
Burnin up the felts, rhythm's rough to me it will
Be strong like a bomb, quick like a comet
Can I get a whatever from Mr. Muhammad?

*Ali scratches interlude*

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Sitting on the dock (huh), fin' to make a wish (word)
Muhammad oh Muhammad (huh), damn you're quite a dish (dish)
Fondeling the groove (groove), with a mystic sense (sense)
Cronies won't you try (huh), they pushy and they're tense (tense)
But I don't give a damn (word), rhythms are the thing (huh)
Rhythms have the key (huh), rhythms make you swing (huh)
If you don't like it (no), you can pucker up (hoo)
You listenin Mr. Quayle (yeah), if you're hiding just give up (hoo)
I'm a rhythm monster (wild), who's out on a prowl (yeah)
Muhammad gives a hoot (hoot) like Woodsy the Owl (yeah)
Comprende my compadre (uh huh)? Kid you want some more (word)?
Muhammad push the button, sample sing the score (ooh)[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Listen up everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The anti batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr Energetic, who me sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
(I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man)
(I don't know, I don't know)

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats cause you can't run the race

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God

[Outro]
The title MC means Master of Ceremony
Some people who MC don't know what this term means[Verse 1: Snag-Dulla]
Ayo, I raise hell, kid, so you can call me Thaddeus
The lyrical G, cold jettin' in a C
Chrome Daytons, inspiratin', motivatin'
Take you to a level, couldn't dig it with a shovel
I'll cramp your fuckin' style like you ate before you swum
Smokin' mad mics, pollutin' muthafuckas' lungs, nigga
It's the triggers that I pull when I have to
Rhymes, kid, I'll pack it in my Eddie Bauer jacket
I take the skill to the letter, smackin' faces, breakin' backs
I'm on a fuckin' chiropractors hitlist
Come on, kid, you're transparent like some plastic
Elastic, stretching cunts, smoking blunts
I eat emcees like liquor eat your liver
It's the Snag, flowing like a natural dirty river
Polluted, couldn't sterilize it if you blue'd it
It's the Know Naim, live long like the Kane
Snap, pop, crackling, microphones I'm tackling, chump
So lay back, close your eyes, puff the blunt
And feel the fuckin' funk
One time for your muthafuckin' mind, and...

[Verse 2: Lo-Income]
This is the next shit, the funky horn of your section
I play emcees like sport, I roll deep with my peeps
They got my back like a Jansport
Lo get sick with his rhymes like fuckin' cancer
When I rock the mic, I get shit hype like a Luke dancer
I drink Ripple, my rhymes shine like a fuckin' nickel
It's the Naim, no games, we don't tickle
You wanna check the Naim? It's all good, par
We bust nuts like Pee Wee Herman in a strip bar
I get wreck on joints lovely while my crew sips the bubbly
Score 60 points, so yo, the coach cold subbed me
Come on, B, c'mon B
Now niggas wanna play Lo funk like Simple E

[Verse 3: Bay Lloyd]
Your career is over, go check the wanted ads
Hop out on stage like niggas hop outta dollar cabs
When I come with flavor, come on, son, don't sweat it
Play like En Vogue because you're never gonna get it
The choice is yours, if you try to play me close
Burn competition like a blind nigga making toast
For Bay to rock the mic is his only desire
Emcees that wear my style, I give 'em quarters for the dryer
Ain't a molester but an ill-dipped dresser
I'm on some chillin' shit like that nigga Large Professor
Like an usher, we collect ducats on some thug shit
Get charm, and I start to see some bugged shit
Pay no mind for those that try to distract me
Road to fame is bumpy so I use mad acne
When it comes to moves, kid, I never fake it
You're busy like ... in the Village gettin' naked
So peace to Ike Love and my man Consequence
Do it like this because Linden represents[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God

[Verse 1]
[Q-Tip]
Listen up everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just livin' like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat in the equator, the brothers in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Draftin' of the poets, I'm the number 7 pick
Licks, licks, licks boy pon your backside
Licks, licks, licks boy pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo, man, I got a Gringo
Yo, we got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask, B
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

[Phife Dawg + Q-Tip]
One for the treble, two for the bass
You know my style Tip, now watch me rip this
I like my beats harder than two day old shit
Steady eatin' booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The anti ... big up,  it's who I be
Brothas find it's hard to do, but never me
Some brothas try to diss Malik—you see'm catchin' me?
Not care about them booty MC's, my shit be hittin'
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitator
Shaheed'll push the fader from here to Granada
Mister energetic—who me, sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
I don't know, man; I don't know, man; I don't know, man
I don't know, I don't know, what, it go...

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God
Oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God ... oh my God

[Verse 2: Q-Tip + Phife Dawg]
Complimentary, are we, the thief of Poetry
I got a humdinger comin' hook, line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints underground
Timbo's on the toes, I love the way it's goin' down
Down like a lady of the evenin'
And when it goes in, honey, just believe it's in
'Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
(Take off your cleats 'cause you can't run the race)
Yeah, this is how we do when we keep it on and on
Do what...
Got my man Big Mo with the streets and the freaks
My man Big Mo with the streets and the freaks
This is how we do when we keep it wild in the sheets
'Cause we got to do it like this, we aim to please
See ya next LP and next CD, and next cassette
Yo, we about to jet
We A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders
Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders
See ya next time 'cause we the Midnight Marauders
A yo, we out 'cause we the Midnight Marauders
Go to the record store and get the shit
We work hard on it
We A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders
Queens got a zone, and Brooklyn got a zone
Like that[*scratched* "Tribe Called Quest"]

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Listen up everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now, when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The anti batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr Energetic, who me, sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
(I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man)
(I don't know, I don't know)

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
'Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats 'cause you can't run the race

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God, yes, oh my God (Repeat 16X)

[*scratched* "Tribe Called Quest"][Q-Tip]
One two, one two
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x3)

Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound, it go
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)

[Phife]
And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same
And when it comes to ripping mics a-yo it ain't no games
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)

[Busta]
A-yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, every time
Oh yes, I'm coming wicked with a new design, I'm saying
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Emcees ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay, yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come with better compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this rap game here we engineer
Stabbing up the jam, yeah son, shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-73 and C-74
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flap a shorty's pockets to the space like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gas, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll cause we in control
Take you out on your hide less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Take you out on your hide less you paying the toll

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Question, why is that emcees be wack
And major labels wanna sign all that crap, a-yo funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cause once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks remove it
Put down the mic kid, cause you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swinging when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last emcee what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's sleepless in Seattle
Rude bwoy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids like Joey Montana
We be the three emcees that make your mind go batty
Mad play on WKRP in Cincinatti
So lord send a hand and if you can't send a hand, send a man
And if you can't send a man, come yourself
Cause all these biting emcees, lord them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make your ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about filling one with lead
Never mind that, man, here come the dread!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far, you know you hear me, star
Bet your bottom dollar
Right after this jam about one million one two niggas gon' follow
Whether it be today or tomorrow
Niggas become aggravating, sickening, you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I'm saying
A-ha a-ha oh a-ha a-ha you know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a motherfucking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama-so mama-sa mama makossa
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Eeeyah! Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit dog sit! Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit[D-Life]
This is the master D-Life
As we set it off with my mans A Tribe Called Quest
And uhh, we got to do it like this baby
We got to do it like that baby
We got the good shit not the bullshit, You know what I mean? Ha hah
We bout to count it down, we bout to count it off
It goes a-one, two, three, and...

[Q-Tip]
Malik we gettin back into that shit again
And when we rhyme, brothers need to break they pens, uh-oh
It's The Love Movement never ends
The rap game'll never be the same again
(Phife Dawg where you at baby?) We came again

[Phife Dawg]
Here I come again, you feelin fine?
The Dawg is like a overflowin rhyme from mind
Usually mess with shorties whose a 8 or 9
Shorty bump around to the bass-line

[Q-Tip]
F keeps a burner on the waist-line
Y'all cat's trick it off, I ain't wastin mine
You feel the uniqueness, you seekin this?
And when we do it, we be freakin this

[Phife Dawg]
Don't even front, you know you feelin this
My shade is borderin around licorice (licorice)
Enjoyin this tune, glad you playin it
(Aiyyo Phife what's the hook?)
Here we sayin it, SAYIN IT, SAYIN IT

Chorus: with D-Life
My pad and my pen (ah ah, you didn't go there)
The beat and the blend (say word, you didn't go there)
The party won't end (you know, we got to be there)
Just keep gettin' ends, buildin with friends, yo
* repeat 2X w/ variations *

[Q-Tip]
One love, one life, and one destiny
It seems that the devil keeps testin me
Got the illest part of the recipe
Yo tell your homegirl to stop stressin me (stop it)
Undressin me is the part you really like
Brothers hold the cracks now they holdin mics
The cusses you get, they feelin steady rights
Marauders, we did that shit at Mid-night, a-ah-aight-aight

[Phife Dawg]
I love it when my honeydip be slobbin me
Don't take it personal, it's just comedy
My comedy completely turned to tragedy
I sense some of these rappers still be mad at me
Sweatin her because of her anatomy
When I bang you it'll be assault and battery
Don't make me discombobulate your microphone
Talkin trash will only get you freakin head, flown

[Q-Tip]
Uhh, buy em out the box, never batty ones
Get in that ass like karate son
My outlook on life, sometimes it's lookin grim
We manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in

[Phife Dawg]
My Tribe be worldwide like the Nike swoosh
Emcees be soundin moist like vagina juice
The top of the world, we pursuin it
Don't worry about a thing, cause we doin it
DOIN IT, DOIN IT

Chorus 2X

[D-Life]
That's the way we do.. c'mon, that's the way we do
It's the nigga D-Life, with T-C-Q
That's the way we are.. and the beat won't stop
Got to blow it up for the top..
Didn't think you knew how we rock..[Chorus 2X]
All we want in this life
Is peace, prosperity and a little paper
Objects, they seem greater
But I'm sure we overcome when we illin' on a drum

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
We in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
Y'all can be my witnesses
That a fella fascination with money has grown
To the point that he will shit on his own
We got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic
A piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
But the money doesn't come automatic
Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
We got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
Some cats go about it with too much passion
We got to mediate our greedy levels
'Cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil
Gotta recognize it, realize the power
That this little ma-huckin piece of paper will devour
Man can be greater than the thing he creates
See, I'mma do my thing and see how much I can scrape
Yo, I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount
That the Sesame Street Dracula can't Count
So that I can give my people when that thing surmounts
To higher levels.. of being.. so when I'm MC-ing
I hope to see you there steady G-ing (say word)
But the only way we can truly reach that goal
Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
It's like that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Phife]
Here comes your royal highness, one of Queens finest
Believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it
Come on son, never leave your mic 'round me
True MC for real, ask my man Shaheed
Strictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for
Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
With all that AIDS stuff going round
Tell me how that sound
Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
Now, don't get me wrong, I love honeys galore
But see hip-hop's my bread and butter
'Cause that's what I get paid for
See this is what I wanted, Allah helped me to get it
And if the beat is wicked, you know Malik will rip it
From the bottom of my heart, that's where the love starts
The love for breakdancing, my love for the art
And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul
A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold
Yeah, I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh, etcetera
But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya?
I'm staying true, nuff respect to those that paved the way
From Bambaataa down to Shah; that be my DJ
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it, word
Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb
One love for lending hand and giving all your help
Believing in me when I didn't believe in my own self
The Abstract with whom I'm always making rugged tunes
Kid Hood resting in heaven, I hope to see you soon
I keep things hot and this year they're even hotter
Big Mu and Shah, one day I'll take my shahada
Out[Intro: Q-Tip]
Phony rappers who do not write
Phony rappers who do not excite
Phony rappers, check it out, aight

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Yo, I was riding the train
And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain: "Let's battle"
It kinda took me by surprise 'cause the brother was moving
Wit' his eyes on the prize, I said 'Screw it'
I ain't got nuttin to lose, but um
But I got to do this shit real quick, so um
Hurry up kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine
And I'll be out 'cause I got to see this hottie,' he said 'OK'
'Now check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'
That's what he said
Then I came back and just fucked up his head
'Cause yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV
Couldn't hold the shit down in New York City
Ayo, I showed his ass, then I went off on my task
To bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down
Yeah, yeah, sonny, to the beat like that
You wanna bring it to me, where you at?

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Yes, dread, I had a similar situation
When this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation
He said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall
I looked him up and down, grab my crotch and said balls
Of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip
And you know me, you know I had to come out my shit
Trying to lounge at the mall, me, Skeff and Mr. Walt
And finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault
He said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickel bags of weed
That's when I proceeded to give him what he needed
Talking 'bout I need a Phillie right before I get loose
Poor excuse, money please, I get loose off of orange juice
Preferably Minute Maid 'cause that's exactly what it takes to write a rhyme, huh
So screw your nickels and your dimes
Because an MC like me be on TV
Don't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC

Phony rappers who do not write
Phony rappers who do not excite
Phony rappers, you know they type
Phony rappers, check it

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
It seems there's a sanitation, y'all full of trash talker
Sounding good, but money, can you be the dog walker?
Talking 'bout your mic days and your breakdancing
Not enhancing, you sound tired...
Oh, shit, I didn't know you like to play yourself in front'cha friends
Sitting there, lying to no end
MC's for me make things happening
Talk about a world but in a form of rapping
Who will be the captain of this ship
If it goes down, don't you know you have to go wit it
Just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks
Doesn't mean that you've reach the MC's peak
Let me stop sounding all bitter
Ghetto child, never be a quitter
But don't be a phony in the litter
Take it as a letter from the better
Take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass Jettas

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg & Consequence]
Yo, Phife, you need a condom
Word to God
Mess around, I catch AIDS from MC's being on my nuts too hard
'Cause on my boulevard, you better bring your bodyguard
And what's your boulevard?
L.B., I represent naturally
So don't step on the boulie if you know that you're phony
Or else I'll bend that ass like elbow macaroni
'Cause I gotta keep it real (gotta keep it real) Yep!
A Tribe Called Quest, you see we never half step
(So on your mark) Get ready, MC's be jetty
Me and Phife be hangin' like Veronica and Betty
Archie, Jughead, snuffing MC's
From Brainslane down to Hempstead
Yes 'Quence, see over
His rhyme style is older that a Chrysler Cordoba
I'm wilder then the cats from Arizona
Villanova, or, or, Kentucky
Who's the next MC stepping up to try and bust me
Bring him here and boy, will I ever let him have it
And when it comes to the microphone, don't even try to grab it
What?!?!

[Outro]
“This feeling of embarrassment
This shyness, this bashfulness

If you take that out of the people then these people will do whatever they want to do
And that is the very definition of America
A people who have no shame and therefore do whatever they want to do."[Intro: Q-Tip]
Ayo, yo, straight up and down
Like 6 o’clock, uh uh, we came to rock, uh uh
Like 6 o’clock, straight up, yo, we came to rock
Ayo, so right now I want everybody up out your seats
You know’m’ sayin’
Everybody come down to the front of the stage
Fuck security right now
Yo, we about to get in this thing like this, yo, yo


[Verse: Q-Tip]
I stand at six feet high with no inches
Realize me, no dream, here’s the pictures
Puttin’ this shit down, where it’s supposed to be
Dimes keep approaching me, but I ain’t joking, B
Can’t you see the look in my mug, there’s no gettin’
I keep a smile on to stop the tears from sittin’
All of my niggas on the dancefloor invadin’
We always ass bettin’ while we keep the girls shakin’
But the mind is motivated towards a positive plane
Everybody across the land is recognizing the name
So what you chattin’ on, akh? You can’t out-rock
I manifest real’, you stiff than hard cock
Constantly you’re coming back for the good shit
The shit to put you inside your ride to move it
Now everybody cuppin’; what you smokin’ or somethin’?
Throw your fruits out your same tank jacket, keep jumpin’
Pay attention and bear, witness to the rare
Individual who’s truly unique on instrumentals
The Abstract, needless to say we influential
The nucleus of B-boy is inside the mental, so uh


[ad-lib until end][Intro: DJ Red Alert]
Check this out, Kool DJ Red Alert
With my man, Q-Tip

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go—on with the program
Credence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brotha who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary ain't it?
The Pubic Enemy

[Interlude: Kool DJ Red Alert]
YEAH!
Let me tell you more about pubic enemy
Ay, Q-Tip...

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
Cuz I see the king with my very own eye
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
And poppin up on the teammates scene
And poppin and pimpin on hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to me, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's trick
The thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin
You could hear him yellin in the motherland
"Baby, baby please. Baby, understand."
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...of the enemy
The Pubic Enemy

[Verse 3: Q-Tip & Kool DJ Red Alert]
Propmaster—yeah?
Please listen to me—what?
Something lurkin by the Jimbrowski
Who? Jenny?
No, not propulated
A horrible creature that must be penetrated
He gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya
You better run fast, he's gonna pursue the...
What? Yo listen here. Propmaster whiz, no one fears...
Okay, bro, just thought I'd let ya know
How he lives and how he go
Watch yourself when you're out on the run
The enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun
There's four friends of mine that thought they were bad
And laid up this girl, so now, they're sad
They scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...

[Outro: Kool DJ Red Alert]
Listen here, this is Cool DJ Red Alert
Known as the true, the only, the very one, the Propmaster
There's only one thing I gotta tell ya
There's a whole lotta propmasters out there
You know what I mean?
Shaheed a propmaster, Q-Tip a propmaster
The Jungle Brothers a propmaster
BDP a propmaster
45 King a propmaster
I won't tell you nuthin' bout the ladies
They ain't no propmaster
But you know who's the main propmaster—ME!Q-Tip:

Q-Tip:
Everybody get sweaten, a deep is still a threaten
About the AIDS, that hate the aids, but still will be forgettin
About the ??? like the rocky picture horror
Don't move tracks, cause the pubic had the hour
You can get it from sleepin' in nasty dirty sheets and
Wearin' nasty clothes for oh about a weekend
I suggest you do yourself a big favor
The press I keep questin, I'll be damned if I save ya
Please remember this: a kiss is just a kiss
A hug is just a hug, but a bug ain't just a bug
If you get the bug, oh boy, you'll be buggin'
You'll regrets your moments even when you started lovin'
....... Damn! After loving, just take it out
Don't get so far to Q, man

Inspect yourself, protect yourself
Respect yourself, then correct yourself
Make sure you don't get hand by the man

Yo I'll leave man, damn[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Q-Tip is my title, I don't think that it's vital
For me to be your idol, but dig this recital
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing
Slinging this and that, 'cause this and that was missing
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
Afrocentric living, Africans be givin'
A lot to the cause, 'cause the cause has been risen
Some brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'
Coming off like the days when we used to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker
A glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheering?
I am what I am, that's a tribal man
We all know the colors, we all must stand
As we start our travels, things they will unravel
"Que sera sera", for this unit is like gravel
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
The clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'
Like Tip said in "Ham and Eggs", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
Embellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?
The roots of the rap filling up the gap
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The boom, the bip—the boom-bip
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
This ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
Repair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Marching off the project, we hope that you will subject
It's good to be an object and never, ever reject
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Redeems should be handed, don't let me demand it
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Although she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie
God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?
The pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two
We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?
This society of fake reality
Are nothing but a peg of informality
While I sing my song, sing it all day long
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
The name is Q-Tip, entering through the middle
From the left, dead all the jokes and the riddles
Coming for the maximum gain, the octane
That's on the radio, it made me feel so low
Emcess have gotta write in the damn prison
I'm Nintendo 64 and you Mattel Intellivision
Bussing from them old trey-eights, now papi wait
This joint is like a Ruger, watch it roar like a cougar
Now we gotta move on the dance floor
And work it out all night, that's what you came here for
Just him, I fills it to the rim
Your shine is looking dim; daddy, shine the light on him
And him is me, leader of the Starfleet Force
Guaranteed to knock your joint off course
You took a loss? Damn right
Sure as Tina made Ike
We gon' put it in your noggin all night, and all day
The tri-lateral commission we missin'
Tell the citizens we straight, but like snakes, they hissin'
I'll be damned if I let a song go on to the side
Won't piggyback some shit, let's ride, come on

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
When you hear this, recognize you hear love
MC nigga illin' over B-boy dubs
Riding through the shit like Tron
Does it matter if you're on board, do you wanna get on?
'Cause if you do, watch all the moves that we make
Gotta do your things, ain't no time for mistakes
It's a hip-hop cat that can't fuck with Jake
Just because he wear a badge doesn't mean he's straight
So, chew on it, swallow it down and let's make it
Disregard those who fake it
Yo, it doesn't matter about the whelm, hip-hop is to the helm
It's the vine that hit the mind like slippery elms

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Put it down now, put it on down
Put it down now, put it on down
I put it down now, put it on down
I put it down now, put it on down
I put it down, man, what you gon' do?
Put it down, woman, what you gon' do?
I put it down, man, what you gon' do?
Put it down, woman, what you gon' do?[Intro: Q-Tip]
It's a fly love song

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my mama is sick I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide
That's how the runnings go
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving ("Let me tell you")
I'm leaving ("Let me tell you")
I'm leaving ("Let me tell you")
Your wack show

[Interlude: Q-Tip & Phife]
Yo man what's up with that?
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry!
And the Abstract rapper says

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider
And my occasional potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't taking no shorts no more, now
Please act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like you know
It's, the 90s, time to make moves
Not, the 80s, do away witcha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Diggy dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy
Dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy
Dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy
Dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy[Intro: Prince Paul]
It's a new decade
The Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo
The usual rhythm

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Devoted to, the art of moving butts
The rhythm's happening, and it's moving up
The Tribe has been on hold for much too long
Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong
On the corners, brothers bop their heads
From the high-tops to the natty dreads
I'm a nubian y'all, look what we did
Took the crust away from the third eyelid
Now it's kinda open, longs to see the sight
Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed outright
Night after night, day after day
Questing for the rhythms of the Native Tongue way
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door
Things a B-boy has never seen before
Poly-rhythm addict with a big fat boom
You have an eargasm as you start to consume
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem
Yeah, it's from the heart, cos it's from the home
Jarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Call me Koala, got what you need
You're a disc jock, then jock this
Rhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss
If you feel uptight and you need to freak
It'll be alright once we drop this beat

[Hook]
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Ma Massa-ya, Ma Makossa
Gets hectic, freak a bourgeois
We quest around for the musical heart
On avenues, streets and boulevards
Not selling out, that's a negative
Loving Hip Hop, loving heritage
Got the instinct to travel miles and miles
Gotta whole lot of rhythm, piles and piles
Now you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk
From the Zulu Nation, topping all the junk
Standing on the top like the Temptations said
Rhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed
Read what I read, can't be better said
Tribe'll lick motions dabble in the head
Sweetback's bad, not as bad as a beat
It's a (stone groove baby)
Continue, on the windy road
But, I'm lugging, a crazy big load
Will we be on point for the ninety dec
Is it muscle bound and will it flex?
But trudging, we are used to
You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew
We're four, once more, must make the tracks
You see four fronts, but now you see four backs

[Hook]
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm[Punch] Yo! We about to rock this joint, from the family. And
We want ya'll all to know, that it's time...

CHORUS (all):
To rock rock ya'll
Freak freak ya'll
To the beat ya'll
It's unique ya'll (2x)

[Punchline]
A-yo praise the master, make plans wit' your pastor
My rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter
I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture
Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter
In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after
You only know half of the math, it don't add up
The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter
Watch me now! Just begun like Jimmy Castor
I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders
Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter
Me and my squad build just like contractors
I break shit, you only give hairline fractures
Women flash us, don't know ya better ask us
A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters
Tear down the rafters, venereals couldn't clap us
You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper

[Jane Doe]
The church of scientology, feminine biology
Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we
Polluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology
While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy
Probably an oddesey, started back on robbery
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology
Let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology
Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!
Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology
Fuck modesty, studyin' microbiology
Causin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my geneology
Six months of sobriety, movin' very methodically
Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography
Guard technology, rip shows antibiotically
True thugs bionically, give birth to criminology

[Wordsworth]
Yo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin'
I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes-on humpin'
For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in
I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'
Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven
One would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin'
Before I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin'
Oh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin'
But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin'
Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in
Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in
Told people you got in free when you really snuck in

[Q-Tip]
We never get concerned about who's in the league
We just stay workin' so no one will need
An unconcerned outsider givin' niggas feed
My niggas puff weed but negotiate the seed
The family is granite and you can't intercede
I try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed
Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed
We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these
Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed
Poker face creed while my mind just read
Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
That's insignificant but this take heed

[Mos Def]
They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is
I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is
My game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is
The aim is, to make you recognize what the name is
Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is
The place with the greats who originate the flavors
An all-star block with some all-star neighbors
(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters
Achin' cuz they hear us rotatin' on the playlist
From B-boy laces to Detroit gators
Yo Tip I got to bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this...

Yo! We wan't ya'll to know...that this is the family, right?
And what we want everybody out there to do...on the dance floor...
Is get ready...because noooowwwwww we gonna...

CHORUS (6x) to fade outCheck my style out
Life situations are the ones I speak about
It seems cats nowadays be gettin' introduced to courage
Don't get discouraged 'cause my words are fluid like flourish
We got the bounty, we from the Queens county
Overlookin' things like a Rushmore Mounty
And got no other choice except to get a little love
We rise above, the beat be fittin' like a glove
The pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy
We have no other ploy but to bring the B-boy
There's nothing on this Earth that can instill fear
The locomotive, puttin' my thing in gear
I only have the fear of God and that's taqwa
You need Binaca; your trap is blazing like Blanka
I got the lethal, you couldn't put a match to it
Let me know, yo, where we could do it like Stuart
Mind over matter, action is needed
When the big one not to be superseded
Responsibility is somethin' I can't deny
The illegalties is the nonsense reply
Most cats who scramble do so because they want to
But known to kick rhymes in the past on impromptu
My willy's hot like two links in the skillet
A room filled with speakers, one stage, watch me kill it
Knowledge should be sought from the cradle to the grave
Rhyming opposition get it twist like Super Dave
You be looking bug just like Uncle Jesse
Don't make the scene messy
'Cause it'll jump, that's word to Aunt Bessie
Profound sentences of pure lyric gems
Some of my friends be liking people with stems
Folks be on the chase for this cheddar
Thinkin' it makes your life better
But it can make you ass out
And when I'm at a show chicks never pass out
We got the joints to make the whole Mash Out out
A Tribe Called Quest make the party go down
Plus we bring positive vibes to fill up all your crowns
Lyrics comes to cats like a hot and cold flash
Some can come with ease, therefore, it's in a smash
Held the fort down like the Justice League hall of Super Friends
But in the world turmoil spins
Brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
City life breeds contempt for each race
All praises due to Allah and I should say it
It's The Abstract motivator making things clear
Puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll
'Cause you know this kid has got wild soul
Americana makes drama like starved-out piranha
Cold like ice, jet hot like a sauna
It's the haves verse the have-not
And guess who's arrived in the hood
Exposing all wrongs, it's all good
Ayo, word up, hip-hop is live like a wire
Let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
I got to stress it again, this here is for my kin
And all my babies, children of the world, no maybe's
So, yo, we gotta move through and push through
Because we gotta make it happen, keep it true blue

It's like that
So much confusion goin' on
So much confusion goin' on
Inside all mine
Inside all mine
So much confusion goin' on
Uh, uh, uh, uh
But everything will be fine
So much confusion goin' on
So much confusion goin' on
Gotta make it alright
Gotta make it alright
Gotta elevate your mind
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind[Chorus]
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Ayo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Zs, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there
(Yeah!) Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
Yes, yes, y'all, (Yes, y'all!)
Who got the vibe? It's the Tribe, y'all (Tribe, y'all!)
Real live, y'all (Live, y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that?) Brown!
So, may I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates (Contact!)
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom, bip
With a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping, and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook, old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo; what's the scenario?

[Verse 3: Dinco D]
(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an (L-ah-!), an (-eader!), simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (Later!) later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what! The O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight
Laugh, yo, how'd that sound? (Ooh!)

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no (criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did—

[Busta Rhymes]
—I heard you rushed and rushed (and attacked!)
Then they rebuked and you (had to smack!)
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear—

[Q-Tip]
—You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not bragging, tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!

[Chorus]
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo
Good mornin', good mornin'
Hey yo Bo knows this, and Bo knows that
But Bo don't know jack 'cause Bo can't rap
I use nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs
Smoke ya like herb if your style is to the curb
Making more hits than Sonny and Cher
Stop, look, and listen but please don't stare
Slammin' emcees as if my name was Ric Flair
But since I'm dark, call me Koko B. Ware

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
Yo, I know the scenario
Chaps, I rap, superierieo
How now brown cow with A Tribe Called Quest
The Leaders of the New School, the LONS, the LONS
Kick the beat, like Peter Pumpernickel
After the lab, I go fix me a pickle
Watch the boob tube, to gimme some space
The girlfriend shares, and the girlies' underwears
Make me sick of all the [?], AAAH, [?]
From radio to the video to Arsenio, tell me, yo
What's the scenario

[Verse 3: Posdnuos]
Ichabod cat got nothin' on a ?
I got headphones to match [?]
Stop kick more when I tour as is
Plugs is connect as oral sex come correct
I got checks bigger than bigger than Busta's blunt
I don't go on the frees but I just tease on the ease of a tick tick tack tock
I got lickety [?] but I won't smear
So someone Plug One on my vibe
As I muscle much dollars, gripping much cheese
Keep it undercover like a yellow submarine

[Verse 4: Chris Lighty]
Yo
You got the B.I., then you add the zero
Chop the track, yo, scenari-ario
Funk the flow, ho, you never know
Will I got off the 'locks or will I let them grow?
Show to show, ho to ho
Booties is bangin' 'cause I'm the pro
Mash up the track then I start to flow
Pass it on 'cause here I go

[Verse 5: Mista Lawnge]
The Black Sheep has arisen, oh dear
The cat's out the bag and that's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, take it to the rear
I like to see my dick snot disappear
Some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is liver
In and out of any situation like MacGyver
If it's not Bo Peep, then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to getting ass, I'm a striver
Give me ten hoes to bone and there won't be no survivor
Peace from the nine point fiver

[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]
Hey yo, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh uh, all over the track
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Raow, raow, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
Rhythm in sync, the rhymes are on time
Yo ripping up the sound like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario

[Verse 7: Dinco D]
True blue, Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than two
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah-, an -eader, simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later

[Hook]
Here we go, yo; here we go, yo
So what's, so what's, so what's the scenario?
(Repeat until fade)[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Good mornin', good mornin'
It's about 10 o'clock and I'm just yawnin'
I throw on my gear and the cologne called Stetson
Grab my dough and I'm out like George Jetson
It's a lovely day and I'm geared to go
We have work to do. so I head to the studio
Everything is fine, and everything is cool
We're doing a jam with the Leaders of the New School
Thinking to myself 'this is gonna be rough'
There's about 8 of us, and 8 is enough
Milo, Busta Rhymes, Dinco D, Charlie B
Q-Tip, Jarobi and my man Ali
Writin' rhyme after rhyme and then start to flow
But yo, Charlie B (AAH), what's the scenario?

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
I know the scenario
Chap, I rap, superierio
How now brown cow with A Tribe Called Quest
The Leaders of the New School, the LONS, the LONS
Kick the beat, like Peter Pumpernickel
After the lab, I'll go fix me a pickle
Watch the boob tube, and gimme some space
The girlfriend shares and the girlies' underwears
Make me think of all the zones, AAAH, [?]
From radio to the video to Arsenio, tell me, yo
Yo, what's the scenario

[Verse 3: Jarobi]
Two to the three to the four to the skip
Jarobi, Jarobi on the LONS tip
Don't like the pig and I don't like hog
After the show get a squalid dog
Don't grovel like a groupie, by the ill hooptie
Bang it, bang it, that's what suits me
We roll blunts and so, so what? I don't want no flabby butt
FEMININE FATT, FEMININE FATT
Yeah, yeah G, all that
Smoke the hootie mack like a goddamn pro
Yo, yo, G, what's the scenario?

[Hook]
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's, so what's the scenario?
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's, so what's the scenario?

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Oh oh
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, hey yo, hey yo
Feel the tricks and the mystic of the flow
Thick like the pie of an onion yuppie
Jarobi got a dog but I got a squalid puppy
The Rumple Busta Rhymes, no need to be braggin'
Loud like a roar from a dungeon dragon
If your tush is small, miss, you're zero
And if your butt cheeks are thick, show me your hero
Who are we? Leaders Leaders of the New School
With an alliance with the Tribe so clean up the jewel
So go suck a lemon, set off the inferno
You're left in suspense, so what's next on the scenario?

[Verse 5: Q-Tip]
What's the scenario as the wind (BLOWS)?
Yo, attention span short so don't (IGNORE)
Hey yo, hey yo
As the door opens, the plot just thickens
Speed agility, that shit quickens
Tip is sticking, sticks to stones
Stones to bones, I got a Jones
As microphones are in my dreams
It swallows me and then I scream
Ooh! Hot damn, I'm swift
Yo and see the top man to get the top spliff
Sit down, ignite with Miss Mary [?]
Yo Mary, yo what's up for tonight?

[Verse 6: Dinco D]
Hey yo, scenario, what does it mean?
Ding dong, the beat has Kong so we must be Kings
Not because we're dirty, not because we clean
But we kiss girls with the big butt jeans
(Meaty bone, meaty bone) One for all
(Meaty bone, meaty bone) Can ya hear the call?
'Cause rings around the rosie with a big fat if
The Tribe brought a vibe then we spark some spit
The spit started sparkin', sound sounded super
Should such a scenario be reserved for the future?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's the idea, now what do you hear?

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Phife]
The second go round it's the Phife from Quest
The one who like the brown skinned girlies with the nice round breasts
You know the rest, oh yes? (Oh yes)
Oh yes, I won't dare stop until my better is best
I'm known for maxin' or relaxin', or just chillin' hard
Find me on Sayers Ave. or Linden Boulevard
Wake up in the morning and I eat the wheat Chex
[?] sex, that's when I get vexed
Step inside the crib with a 6 pack of Beck's
Or just pass the EZ Wider before I break your neck

[Verse 8: Charlie Brown]
Checka one, checka two, checka three, CHECKA FOUR
Mr. Muhammad, give it up some more
AYE AYE AYE, that's how it flows
Soon to boom is Pinocchio
A Future Without A Past
Strong Island is where I took class
A high pitch for the skins one to ten
Charles in Charge, here we go again
Seminars are whack, look at the panel
Same brown time, same brown channel
[?] is phenomenal, yo, AH, AH, AH, what's the scenario?

[Verse 9: Jarobi]
Heyo, pimpin' pumps is real easy
Specially when the ho is real greasy
Don't riff with the raff but the real thing
Don't stutter step but I will sing
Step to ya like a poker poker chip
Now you're off on the mystic MYSTIC
Come on, cutie pie, gimme a sugar hit
Now you wanna be my honey dip
Step to the mic with an ill grin
Countin' six hairs on my chinny chin chin
Mystic man with the ill flow - Busta, bust a scenario

[Verse 10: Busta Rhymes]
Bust it out, before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm's in sync (DEMO CUTS HERE)[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Here in 1992 we present
The fabulous What's The Scenario remix
Whereas there are seven MC's
Six which are in physical form, one which is in spiritual essence
And he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD!

[Verse 1: Kid Hood]
Check the vibe, walk that ass or get got
F it (shit) I lick buckshots
Hood, madman, I rip up stages
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis
Extra, extra, pick up a clip
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!) and grab my dick (Ohh!)
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
Death on the phono, my skills are porno
You say "oh no," you bitch ass homo
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time
I slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time
Sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can
(Say what, say what?) I'm a bad, bad man

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips
The Five-Foot Assassin has just raided your area
Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya
(So!) Roll out the red carpet 'cause I'm kickin' this
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew
And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, F you too
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to
You're better off calling D-Nice to your rescue
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
As for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I shut 'em down
The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop
The five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
So do like Michael Jackson and "Remember the Time" (Do you remember?)
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin 'cause you sure can't rhyme

[Verse 3: Cut Monitor Milo]
(Big up, big up!) Enter new identity
Next to say something 'cause you pass it to me
What does it take to check a technique?
(Many styles, many styles!)
Hostile heat, brings bursts of energy
Milo in De Dance is the new identity
One two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect
Ten to one that I come (Correct!)
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots
So I can grow dreadlocks
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Kicking right inna your what's it not
I could rock longer but fair is fair
So C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)
C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)

[Verse 4: Charlie Brown]
Makin moves y'all (Moves y'all!) On and on and on
(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn
(Who's that?!) just one of the L.O.N.S
And A Tribe Called Quest (East coast) to West
Remix mad kick, more than Metallica
To all MCs fall like the Battlestar Galactica
Stampin', stompin', rompin' Compton
(People all over the world!) I'm promptin (Style!)
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle
Representation, sensationalization
"Scenario" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so
(Here we go yo!) Yeah
Force, Main Source LP on the rise
In living color let's see through original eyes
And I'm out like shout, Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh
(Ooh ahh, ooh ahh!) There it is baby pah

[Verse 5: Dinco D]
Flying in on a limb, slim trim, D I am
There I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim
Sight we be right, be polite for my mics
Like I'm like (See sick, see syke)
And slip away, and off to the Poconos
Spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
Yamaha (Ay-Ha May!)
Let's flip the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)
Enough enough, Ms. Fitted I'm with it
If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys
Bed rest, spread test, and yo I'm like the maddest
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale
Bounce the b-ball cause beats are being yelled
In the hallways always ringing with a (Ho!)
This is my two times nine on the Scenario

[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
Check it out everybody, rhymes and mics
Black mens gettin' loot (Doin' what they like!)
Eight black brothers in the public eye
If you listen very close, I will tell you why
(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown
Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down
Will commence to rock (Rock!) So bring on the flocks (Flock!)
In-terrogation for the knockin of the box
The boom-box ruler, controls the medulla
None come cooler, I win like Shula
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
Intensified mind, non-blunt consumer
Tip will come booty (Well it's only a rumor!)
The meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
Hey what we gon' do (Dooo) in '92
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
Ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground
What's goin on my man? (Goddamn!) And now my brain is hurtin'
Listen up, Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em
Flip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em
Open up your mouth if you want the food
To get rude, Flipmode, 'cause I'm in the mood
Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah man, that's how it goes
Body drippin with blood comin out your nose
Give me a Band-Aid, what are you asking for?
(More!) Only your sacred and pure
Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap
Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
Yeah y'all in '92, I'm packin my roach spray (Anyway!)
Take a lick, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School
Mad brother when stealthy
RRRAAAOW RRAOW RRAOW!
To my dragon, baby, stop whinin'
I see my influence still shinin'
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo
That's the Scenario![Chorus]
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Ayo, Bo knows this, (What?) and Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (Yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
Yes yes y'all (Yes y'all!)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all!)
Real live y'all (Live y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that?) Brown!
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve rotates the gates
(Contact!) Can I get a hit? (...Hit!)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario?

[Verse 3: Dinco D]
(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah-, an -eader, simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later, (Later!), later, alligator
Pop goes the weasel and the herb's the inflater
So yo the D what the O, incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound? (Ooh!)

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no (criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

[Q-Tip]
You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine!
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When digging in the mind library
Oh-my-gosh! Oh my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Roar, raow, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Ripping up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!

[Chorus]
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Sometimes men and women look at themselves and see bliss
Through experience, we tend to exist
That's through our past or our caretakers
The instance is in particular, so you need to recognize that
If you take all this away
And look at us at the end of the day
We stand great among creation
So baby take these words as a little inspiration
While I kick this shit get your ass motivation
MCs, you're walking a thin line
Get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines
And plus vipers, phony rhymers, and biters
Money-grubbers, beat-dubbers
Amongst a whole host of others
Who be fakin', fraudulatin'
Waitin' for your bacon
They'll be takin' and skatin' while you sit contemplatin'
Who's your peoples
Well let me tell you somethin' now paw
We're livin' a world that's R-A-double-raw
It's crazy but it's true, go for delly is the law
And if you cross the path then you dangerin' your jaw
And if you Glass Joe, don't go toe-for-toe
Yo all we wanna do is our thing and lay low
So brothers hold your heads high when you get down
Don't violate these women cuz we need them around
It's all of us together, not the one without the other
The Abstract is ill, word to mother

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
We got to do our due, not separate, together
Got to move on through, not separate, together
Got to do our due, not separate, together
Got to move on through, not separate, together

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, we got some problems baby
People stressed out, check it
But we can make it Sugar
Keep it light and I say
Move on through separate
Not together but together
Not separate, that's how
We got to do it, check it on out
Bust it, yo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

[Chorus: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The business)
Always getting fronted on at shows (The business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the business)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the gains just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say "Where's my loot?"
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cause you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, "More soup with your meal?"
Cause this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg]
Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt

[Chorus: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

[Verse 5: Sadat X]
The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
"Oh, he's a cutie", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game and I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

[Verse 6: Diamond D]
Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing ("Boy, get a job")
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild[Intro: Q-Tip]
Do you know the importance of a skypager?
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Those who don't believe, see you're laid behind
Got our skypagers on all the time
Hurry up and get yours cause I got mine
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine
If you're with a G and you're sipping wine
Eating cacciatore with a twist of lime
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Joint by base, then you get your high

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
If you get your high, then mines is next
The 'S' in skypage really stands for sex
Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
Having bad days like a voodoo hex
Conceptually, a pager is so complex
That I be standing by the phone, ready to flex

[Chorus]
Welcome, wel-wel-welcome to the new skypager
Wel-welcome to the new skypager
Welcome to the new skypager, new skypager
Enter telephone number or other numeric message

[Bridge: Q-Tip]
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
The batteries I use are called Duracell
They last for three weeks so they do me well
Don't be going through no phases, my joint stays on
24-7, from dusk til dawn
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
Your greed for the Phifer, I can be reached
A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code '69", that means you want some (cock)

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is cause it makes me scowl
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothas know it hurts when you're on the prowl
Grabbin' on my joint cause I'm an eager owl
Get paged by a G or a business pal
My shit is overflowin', they won't allow
Another page, so I'll just end this now

[Outro]
(Message sent, thank you for calling skypager)[Chorus: Elton John, A Tribe Called Quest]

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Yo, ATCQ, Massive and crew
Bars to any beat, we beat the beat for true
Massengale MC’s, you smell like pussy stew
Don’t let it be you, man up my youth
Phife, you should've spoke of, man you'rein the mode of
Leave that to me, el-Hajj Malik
The man with a plan who went for it all
Like Marauders on a mission when we killin' dance halls
Mmm, Saga boy, Trini man
Ride out when mic is in mi hand
Loved all of mi fans, one, two, three of dem all of the gang

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip & Phife]
With a couple pound a weed and a couple dollar van
Hmm, broke pockets, find another plan
Yeah, cyan dun, push up on the one
And big up the sound man, dibby dibby DJ walk
Ayo Bus with them a talk
They don’t want no prob, they don’t want no issue
Outline them in bloodclaat chalk
Earlier in the night when we bring out the music
With a box and a band killer sound boy movement
Live and direct when it all goes down
You an idiot boy, you don't wanna fuck round
Big tune make the world go round
Make way for the sound boy crown
Don't you know we're the wickedest sound
One box off in your face make a sound boy frown

[Bridge: Elton John & A Tribe Called Quest]
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound

[Outro: Q-Tip & Elton John]
Sound checking, a million watts are shaking the room
In just a few hours you're gonna feel the burn
All of the goons are checking their guns at the door
A solid wall of sound is here on tour
It's gonna get loud—so no phones allowed
It's gonna get loud—so no phones allowed(quiet eerie voice) Yooooo....Yooooo...I hope ya'll ready...
Are ya ready? Here we go....

[Q-Tip]
What ya deal with...uhhh...
What ya deal wit'...what ya deal wit'...
Turn me up some more?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Incognito, speakin' to ya
Feel this, have it, makin' music
Men and women, boys an' girls an'
Welcome to the movement, the fifth wit' improvement
Aristotle, Plato, Freud
Yeah right, Abstract, never void
I make it easy for ya'll to boogie down to
Hard to the ground, ooh the Tribe with the sound boo
Touch me, tease me, feed me, squeezy
Take it easy, never sleazy
Promise that I will not answer
The phone when it rings love, while we do out thing love
Never fakin', enslave spirits
Through the music is our mission
Money's cool, but not cooler than a ghetto rebel risin'
To overthrow a ruler
Dearly beloved, dearly departed
There's a reason why we did it
Cuz it's inside the body and the hearts
So here we are fam let's start, c'mon...

Hook [2x]
Don't beat me in the head with the bullshit bat
C'mon everybody let's start

Ummah, Mos, Jane Doe, Willy
Punchline, Wordsworth, SV, Chrissy
S.O.S., Tribe Called Quest
Get it off your chest, say it: "Tribe Called Quest!"
Can you feel it when it hit right
Can you feel it when we do it
Truth, power, taste, devour
Niggas in the street here comes the illest beat now
Move oceans wit' your mental
Think it, do it, be it, embellish
Here's another point for everyone to relish
When Ski busts his tools all ya'll foes will embellish
For somethin' wicked at ya'll faces
What I see is longin', needin'
Hey I got you with that goooooood stuff
And ya probably won't get enough
Ay-yo, lyrics I got it, lyrics, cadence
Do it with fun and patience
Funky, rhythmic, characteristic
Ebonically lingustic wit' the ghetto futuristic
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay....

CHORUS (2x)

Beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head
Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head
Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head
Don't beat me in the head, head, head, head...

So here we are fam let's start, so here we are fam let's start
So here we are fam let's start, so here we are fam let's start
To the Ummah family lets start
A-yo get off your ass and let's start, A-yo, here we are fam let's start
C'mon, get off your ass and let's start, here we are fam let's start
Here we is fam let's start, get off your ass and let's start

[Phife] Yo Kamaal
[Q-Tip] Reggie Noble
[Redman] Up in ya!
[Q-Tip] Yo Busta Bus, yo it's time to step up

[Busta Rhymes]
You know I plas-ter, the little bas-tard
And mastered the real way you slap the bitchest niggas backwards
Hah! Uh-oh, aiyyo, whenever Busta Rhymes say so (mmmhmm)
When we move yes (mmmhmm) sometimes we lay low (mmmhmm) aiyyo (yo)
Big up my little nigga Pedro
Make you after the L like turkey, cheese and to-ma-to (to)
Fuck is that? Especially for niggas that will pay no
Attention to instructions, like they still wan' disobey y'all
Wonder twin powers activate real quick
So that I could grow about five feet more with an extra dick
One dick to hold in my hand when I'm rockin the mic
The extra dick to blow up the pussy for the rest of the night
Then I return with more lyrics like a bunch of rough niggas
They tough niggas that snuff niggas (hah)
I know the club got enough niggas (huh!)
To slap your face, expert, who the next jerk, to make me
Exert heat? FUKKIT, let me network!

[Redman] Ha-hah!
[Q-Tip] Yo Reggie Noble
[Redman] Feel me, yo Busta Bus
[Busta] What up?
[Q-Tip] Yo Phife Dawg, yo it's time to step up

[Phife]
Yo what the fuck, ungh!
Check it here, peep the four-man transaction (action)
Phife diggy Dawg, we on some Todd Shaw mackin (mackin)
You know my stee', there's no time for relaxin (relaxin)
Word to Reggie (Phife Dawg) yo it's time for some action
Girl swing yo' ass, I can feel you climaxin (climaxin)
Don't even front, you know you wanna make it happen (make it happen!)
Yo Busta Bus, do you hear Violator faxin? (mad faxin)
Eighty G's for one show (eighty G's yo) that's satisfaction (satisfaction)
Now which emcee feel like he fuckin with dis heah? (This here)
Word to Queens, I keep shit hot like a knish, yeah (Nish yeah!)
Malik is back, I'm here to make you look foolish (foolish)
My roughest niggas than the afro on Coolidge (Coolidge)
Remember White Shadow? My click stay sharper than an arrow (c'mon)
Plus in Trinidad I'm treated like the Mighty Sparrow (uh-huh)
Freestylin son, like there was no tommorrow (fuck it up nigga fuck it up)
Hence the reason why your bitch ass would love to follow (what?)
Two different toasters in your chest will make your shit hollow
How's about them apples, oh is it too hard to swallow?
Push your wig back, word to Big Moot and Bolo
Billy Razor, Fudge Lover, on down to Sha and Litro (Love Movement)
Yo Bootsy takes this mic from this fool see, make him run it
Five-foot invasion son, you can't run from it

[Busta] Yo Reggie Noble
[Redman] Blaoowww, yo Phife diggy!
[Phife] What up?
[Busta] Yo yo Kamal it's your time to step up!

[Q-Tip]
Check it out, the original, shit, we makin it
Takin it, to the extremes, we breakin it
When we get, inside a zone then you feel that it's good
All you jelly cats stop marinatin my wood
Niggas, grab the mic with loads of malarky
I bring the knowledge and wield the anarchy
Put it on pooh-butts who's unsettled with ignorance
Give the last sentence with poignance and diligence
Eighteen wheelin through niggas like truckers
Breakin ankles, put it on like we at the ruckus
Guaranteein that shorty can move it around
In the place that gets you hot but leaves you here on the ground
Contenders don't you even think to challenge the crown
Of these brothers who so elequently hold the beat down
Fuck the rigamarole, we vyin for the control
We the musical equation of the whole entire nation

[Q-Tip] Yo Phife Dawg
[Phife] Yes Kamaal
[Q-Tip] Busta Bus
[Busta] What up?
[Q-Tip] Yo Reggie Noble yo it's time to step up

[Redman]
Yo yo
I'm just a ill nigga who don't got it all up stairs
Riding dick, get the balls til they come in pairs
Oh yeah, throw the goggles on these engineers
Cause it might, get kinda wet when I spit this here
Yo, I'm six-foot-one with a big ass gun
To carry it you'd need a waistline the size of Big Pun
But I move crowds without a gun
Like if -- The New York State Lottery is ninety nine million!!
Hah-hah, yo, when it's time to flow I suprise and blow
Five hundred thousand units off a dime a trow
Forty below, I'm thorough when it's time to throw
The caboose, I'm even hard to be touched by a masseuse
Whoo-whoo! Funk Doc gets the money
And best believe I went through more trees than Sonny
Me, Kamal, Busta Bus, Phife Dawg
Shittin, pussy niggas get Lysol!
Heh heh heh[Intro: Phife Dawg]
Linden Boulevard represent, represent-sent
Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was "Eric B. for Presi—"

[Verse 1]
Rude boy composer, step to me you're over
Brothers wanna flex, you're not Mad Cobra
MC shorty black, there ain't no other
Trini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha they all that, Phife Dawg ditto
Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Queens is in the house represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
No taming of the style cause it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
Huh-huh, here we go, you know that I'm the rebel
Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil
Funky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me
We in like that, you're dead like Presley
When we coming through get tickets to see me
We work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle cause the music is the task
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Right, now I must move with the quickness
Here comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness

[Chorus]
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up!
Steve Biko
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up!
Steve Biko

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg and Q-Tip]
New York City represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after
Yo Tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying
So much going on, people killing, people dying
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental
Yo I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver
Percussion isn't less, Ds wear the vest
Why they dodging bullets, you should be dodging Quest
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pelé
Tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Ok, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the mall
We welcome competition cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest also to stay alive[Intro: Faith Evans]
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

[Verse 1: Consequence, (Q-Tip)]
Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?)
Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?)
American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
(Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream)
(Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember)
(Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December)
(And brothers on the block packing nines like September)
(Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender)
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

[Chorus]
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

[Verse 2: Consequence]
You got the N.W.O. (low cash flow)
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)
And crosstown niggas trying to (bust at you)
Aiyyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)
So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch-hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spittin
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whipped cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash dancing, yo, I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I'll be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's
And all I want is the world to know my steez
These money hungry niggas is seven thirty
And got me stressed out like these frog emcees

[Chorus]
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Until my best friend caught two in him head (Right, scene)
And ever since that day (ya not hear me?) things been a mess
R.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless
So nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress
Lay my head on her breast
Sugar dumpling knows best
Explaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest
A little hook up, squeeze up, and no more am I vexxed
Aiiyo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out
Make sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing
Most of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings

I be hating sucker MCs, and the sucker niggas
Posing like they hard when we know they damn card
What you figure, rhyme-wise I do the figure eight so concisely
Musically we are the herb so sit back and light me
Inhale...
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girls desires older female dreams
I be the Abstract Poetic representing from Queens
Socially I'm not inane, black and white got game
If you came to the jam, well I'm glad you came
See, nigga first was used back in the Deep South
Falling out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't, neither does the youth cause we em-
Brace adversity it goes right with the race
And being that we use it as a term of endearment
Niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme
Yo I start to flinch, as I try not to say it
But my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray the

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Sucka nigga, nigga nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
It's the neo-nigga of the nineties c'mon

[Outro]
Aiyyo Shaheed, take us the fuck outta here

You're not necessarily a man, if you do[Intro: Q-Tip]

You ain't familiar wit' the D, don't go that route
Just keep ya hand on ya toolie if ya walkin' 'bout
It's all live now
And for the greatest amount
But make the ladies say Oh
And the hoes say oww
And the owls say whoot da whoot

It's like dat

Q-Tip (harmonizing):

[Q-Tip + (Phife)]
(And who are you?)
The Abstract
(Ali is here and Jay Dee)
Yeah, he did the track
(Now would you say that it's tight?)
It's type phat
(And what we want y'all to do is)
Is come react

All night night, night night night night
We do it all, all all all night y'all
We do it, all night, night night night night
We do it, all all all night y'all

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Word up
It's The Love Movement, it's all love
‘Cause we make ma-fuckas be fond of us
We like the ladies, intelligent ones
But when the lights go out it's time to fondle us
It's apprehension, when playin' ya joint
‘Cause Jay Dee makes it sound so marvelous
If you beefin', then settle ya soul
While we make all of y'all just bond wit' us
Got your work on you, you better put it away
Police be lookin' for the vandalous
Jay Dee from the D, SV family
Phife, these jokers can't handle us

Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do do

Now what you change ya name to?

And what you really gotta do?
(Get the bank, yo)
And when you wake up in the morning

(I give thanks, yo)
And all these ladies seem to be

(They seem to come in flanks, yo
Because I’m, nice with mines, mad nice with mines
Nice with mines, mad nice with mines, yo, word
Nice with mines, crazy nice with mines
Once again, son, I’m nice with mines
Check it)

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Phife can make it iller with the dominant flows
Put the bite back in it while the confidence grows
Dawg got flea-bitten written, I stay shittin’
On competition, we hittin’ like Cal Ripken
Brothas is playtime like Animaniacs
We be puttin’ in real time, that’s why y’all bangin’ that
Niggas can face off but can’t get shorty
I make y’all erase off ‘cause y’all ain’t naughty
What’s up to Treacherous, let’s get it in line
It’s the girls who’s sweatin’ us, let’s make ‘em refined
You got to, make it hot for the hoods in the street
Wack producers need to stop with them crackhead beats[Hook]
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out

I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out

Them can't touch we, no them can't touch we
Them can't hold we, no them can't hold we
Them can't touch we, no them can't touch we
Them can't hold we, no them can't hold we

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
(Damn Phife, you got fat!)
Yeah, I know it looks pathetic
Ali Shaheed Muhammad got me doing calisthenics
Needless to say boy I'm bad to the bone
Making love to my mic like Jarobi on the phone
But um, no time for jokes, there's bills to be paid
Hoes to be laid, punks to be sprayed
Chumps to attack, so my man watch your back
'93 means skills are a must, so never lack
Sit back and learn, come now watch the birdie
Your styles are incomplete, same as Vinny Testaverde
Battling, whenever -- hot Damn!
Give me the microphone boy, one time, bam!

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Keep it on the cooler cos here come the heat
Lyrically in space the jazz will pace the beat
As we proceed to elevate you we in 4/4
Run and tell your dad the Abstract's the bad
As we proceed to move your hind parts we know as ass
Poets got the gimmicks, but they lack the sassafras
To make the average hardrocker cock the Glock
And roam the city streets on the jury, they hot
I be ingredients, like sugar in candy
If your life is broke, girl I'll be the handy-dandy
That can mend you, my fee is a shower
For you, I scrub the back and I floss the butt crack
Make you shiny, spiffy in a jiff
Fucking with the Ab, you got the greatest of gifts
A-yo, my mic is sounding bugged, Bob Power, you there? (Yeah)
Adjust the bass and treble make my shit sound clear(clear, clear, clear, clear)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Move back yourself man, come watch me drop it
For sure me a go do it, for sure me a go rock it
Me not deal with no changaram, bangaram business
I got soul on the end, like Jehovah's got the witness
Musically, the three, poetically we be
The enchantment on the airwaves, kids just fade
Obey the MCs, cos the MCs say
We flipping on niggas like we Super Dave
But noticing my stature, y'all niggas know we gotcha
Moving to the rapture, listen how we catch ya
Moving with the grace, here we go, let's begin
Making people jump out their goddamn skin
Lyrically, we bite like we Rin Tin Tin
Peace to Grand Pu and his many many skins
Don't mark us for the 'L' cos you know we get the wins
It's the Ab, Shaheed, and the Dawg for the blend

And I wanna say peace to my man Bob P, my man Jerod  (I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out)

[Verse: Consequence]
Just relax y'all, just relax y'all...
I hit 'em with the boom, stick 'em, hahaha, hit 'em
It's the brother named 'Quence, not the victim but I still lick 'em
Still wax that shorty, now you know who got the props
Consequence, hazy flow, you know it just don't stop
'Cause if Monie was Born 2 Breed, I was born to smoke weed, indeed
A smooth player then I pop the seed in you
Yeah baby, I took you to the venue
And if my name was Coco, I still couldn't be into you
'Cause you got snuffed by the crooked tooth bandit
Who never got stranded
But kickin' the funky lyrics that the grands over-planned it, on earth
Has entered in my bottle, baby boy, now I'm gravy by birth
Ain't got a bag of blue funk, but a bag of green skunk
Want dogs? You want it? Muthafucka, knuckle up
'Cause I don't give a damn, my man, I won't deceive ya
Been through more growing pains than that nigga Michael Seaver
An over-achiever, you know you know my style
So peace to my niggas Danja Mo' and the Madchild
When I call a nigga out, he wants to wait  awhile like Janet
Niggas got jealous, they wanna ban it
But I still keep my voice, and when it's all said and done
Ayo, I still bring the noise
We wreck shop, so wait 'til the shit drop
Word is bond, yo, you know we don't stop
So niggas, press your luck, you get stuck like Chuck
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a damn
You know my name and you know who I am
The brother named 'Quence, all copped edition
You know they're 730, so don't fuck around
You will lay around, clown
Linden Boulevard, you know we got a zone
Queens got a zone
You know what? Yo, that nigga's fuckin' gone

No subliminals, with me you know who the fuck you are
Who wanna spar? Haha, well, here I are
Orthodox spitter or bring on the southpaw
No doubt I'mma set it, dudes best be ready
Off top on the spot, no reading from your Whackberry
Leave the iPhones home, skill sets must be shown
I'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone, huh
I got it sewn, eh speak to all clones
Untouchable in my zone, watch it, don't leave him alone
Fuck your ass cheek flows with bars sweeter than scones
Put down microphone

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yes, yes, he the wrong ones to fuck with
No matter what the day
He could catch you on his plane or the one you on today
Visit niggas in their dreams
And make them scream of bloody murder
He's a Trini gladiator, ain't no need to take it further
If you wanna take it further your Huckleberry is here
Doctor of your holiday, Wyatt Earp ya like the tears
We gon' celebreate him, elevate him, papa had to levitate him
Give him his and don't debate him
Top dog is the way to rate him

Yeah, move your body, inside the party
We 'bout to bring it to you kid like we never ever did
My nigga Al G in it, my nigga Shaheed in it
We got the girl Kristine in it, got my man Big G in it

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
A-yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow
I'ma make you move whether woman or fellow
Yo, I got the medals in the Warfield of respect
Like an ill porno make ya body get wet
Just a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow
Hoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow
I'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will
MC's be ready to die cause I'ma kill
All your negative feelings standing on two feet
While I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat
You know it's realer killer, realer than you can imagine
Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen
If I make it happen, that means I'm making motion
And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion
Everybody do the hop, make it smooth like lotion
I lay up in the piece on a incognotion

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Now everybody here, you do the hop
You going up to cop, Uptown for a brick, don't stop
You gotta come back and do the hop
Yo, fuck the cops, you gotta come back and do the hop
Move till your body won't stop
You gotta do the hop, non-stop motion, non-stop
You gotta come back and do the, do the...

[Verse 2: Phife]
You see you, your career is done like Johnny Carson's
Get me vexed, I do like Left Eye, start an arson
Now that I got that out my system
Watch me stab up the track as if my name was OJ Simpson
I packs it in like Van Halen
I work for mine, you, you're freeloading like Kato Kaelin
I'm representing with my crew
Mess around, bite my rhymes, I'll beat that ass with my shoe
C'mon, you know I'm crazy nice
Brothers can't deal with the shorty named Phife
You must be mad in the head
I bust his ass and leave 'im blood clot for dead
Niggas sound like Das EFX
If it ain't Das EFX then they sounding like Meth
You might as well do Megadeth
Y'all punk MCs better save your freaking breath
You's a corny motherfucker
You must be high smoking dust with Chris Tucker
Y'all faggot asses don't want this
I pull more peeps than the peeps at the premier of Pocohantas
Word is bond I am the baddest
And all you honeys out there, word is bond, you know my status
So come and pull your panties down
This ain't the Barnum Bailey show, I don't get down with the clowns
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
But don't bring your ass by and you ain't got no ends
Word is bond it don't stop
Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Come on everybody, do the hop
Even if you cop, you gotta come back and do the hop
You move to the beat, you don't stop
You smoking jump rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop
Then you come back and do the hop
You know we don't stop, we on the ghetto prize on the top
You know we come back and do the hop
Shorties in the place, all the shorty rocks, do the hop
You gotta come back and do the hop
We never go on pop, you know we come back, we do the hop
This is how it is, we do the hop
You move to the beat, then come on everybody, don't...[Intro: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]

Classic example of a (a date rape)
Classic example of a (a date rape)
Classic example of a (a date rape)
Classic example of a (a date rape)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Listen to the rhyme, it's a black-ink fact
Percentile rate of date rape is fat
This is all due to the reason of the skeezin
You got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season
If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break
Especially if a squaw tries to cry out rape
You be all vexed cause she got it goin on
You don't wanna fight cause you know that you're wrong
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
Envision in your head of a great sex bout
Worthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it
You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick it
This is the case, the situation is sticky
Should you try to kiss or hint towards a hickey?
Not even, you can ask Steven
If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin
Hit the road Jack and all of that
But if she offers her abode, you'll drop ya load
Right smack dab in the middle
Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Uh-huh, you know the science, you get buckwild
Runnin' mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone
Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone
If she tries to front, that's when you start to diss her
If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her
Might as well get to the point, no time to waste
Might as well break the ice, then set the pace
You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone
Step out of the shower, throw on cologne
All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho
She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego
You listen to After 7, break fool after 10
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two
Now tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do? Huh
What do you know, when the meow is completed
Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it

[Interlude: Q-Tip]
Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that (zulu)
We ain't goin' out like that (zulu)
We ain't goin' out like that

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Now baby bust it, if you wanna groove
Me and you can do it, it will be the move
I won't cry over spilled milk
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt
I don't wanna bone you that much
That I would go for the unforbidden touch
I'm not the type that would go for that
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat
Baby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude
But I know because of your bloody attitude
I know why you act that way
It usually happens on the 28th day
I respect that crazily
When you're done with the pads can you come check me?
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
Because one head ain't better than two
Check it out

[Outro: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
It's a classic example of a (a date)[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Winter in America, never knew white Christmas
'Cause L7 squares always making my shit list
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Bleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment
Running across stages is a drug
Is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers
Call it the lord’s name 'cause we taking it in our veins
Like the feeding us intravenous
It’s war and we fighting for inches and millimeters
They try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
If we don’t give them martyrs no more, they can’t defeat us
This lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training
The false flags fly at a half mast this morning
Take a bow, this might be your last performance

They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

[Verse 2: Consequence]
The old lady saw us on the lawn with the Henny
Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney
Might've been racist like the waitresses up in Denny’s
Swore we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis
Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech
'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech
Presidents get impeached and others fill in the throne
But veterans don’t get the benefit of feelin' at home
So maybe those projections out at Silicon
Are what drove her to get injections made of silicone
I swear it’s the killing season
'Cause killin' is still in season, yeah

[Verse 3: Jarobi]
Louder than a three pound, voices screaming mad to boot
It must be killing season, on the menu strangefruit
Whose juices fill the progress of this here very nation
Whose states has grown bitter through justice expiration
These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment
Things haven’t really changed
Or they're dormant for the moment
Marks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within
Been on the wrong team so much, can’t recognize a win
Seems like my only crime is having melanin
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for
Causes men to suffocate, I can’t breathe no more
Settle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally
Through all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize it sadly
Black soul bold enough, inner city cold enough
Watch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up

They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya*all vocals by Q-Tip*

Yeah, we do it all for the love y'all
Whether white, black, Spanish, ain't a thug y'all
We do it, we give it all for the love y'all
We just givin' it all for the love y'all
We do it, we do it all for the love y'all
We in the party, put your hands up
Yeah y'all, we do it all for the love y'all

[Verse 1]
Love getting down and I love a cool breeze
Love seein' checks from record companies
Love lovin' love cause I love what I do
And we do our thing for the one nine two
And the rest of the country cause we from there too
Makin' sure love is givin' when I get it from you
Everybody, we regulate the party and shit
Love it when I get a little rugged wit' it
Love the circumstance to make my dough flow right
Love rockin' mics plus the ill style nights
She does it real good but love'll make it mo' better
Got me kind of open in the DK sweater
Love when my peoples come home from jail bids
Really love women and I really love kids
Love tight clubs where the music just bang
Camp-ass with gas women or shorty got bangs
Lovin' it
Yo yo, I'm lovin' it
Love a woman when she got a tight outfit
Outfit meaning outlook and disposition
You love it when a nigga does a love composition
Love peanut butter and jelly on wheat
Wylin' out, makin' hot shit to hot beats
From Ohio to Poughkeepsie
From Phoenix to NC
From Cali to DC
Love it when the pressure falls right on me
Love it when God keeps on overlookin'
Do a tight show so promoters keep bookin'

[Hook]
We do it all for the love y'all
Yeah, we do it all for the love y'all
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all
From the heart inside of the heart y'all
We do it, we do it all for the love y'all
For real, for the love, for the love y'all
All my peoples in the ghettos, for the love y'all
All my peoples all around, for the love y'all
For the love love

[Verse 2]
For my crews bomb, where my peoples still at
If they call me and I don't call back
Four weeks at a time, love is still intact
Let's be big about it, and realize the fact
Love it, when the underdog comes through
Ghetto rebel rise to overthrow these rules
Love it, when I get spared another day
Used to drink zay while my niggas weighed yay
Love it, when I gain control over this
Life is really bigger than the Roley on my wrist
Got a twist to this shit and the answer's inside
Sho as the world's small and the Mississippi's wide
Had to rock a vest over unchoosed stress
Now I see people rockin' theirs in jest
Love it when my loved one really hold me down
Brand new flight and I'm takin' off ground

[Hook]
We do it all for the love y'all
Check it out, we do it all for the love y'all
For the love y'all, for the love y'all
For the love, for the love y'all
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all
Yo, we do it all for the love y'all
For everybody, for the love for the love y'all
Whether white, black, Spanish, ain't a thug y'all
Yeah, we givin' y'all this shit, the love y'all
Just the love inside of the heart y'all
Yeah, for the love for the love y'all
Yeah, for the love for the love y'all[Hook: Q-Tip]
We got somethin
For all of y'all
We like to play
We like to ball
This is a story
For all of you
When we do our thing
We got to do it true

[Verse: Q-Tip]
Sittin in my canvas in the corner of my room
12:45 as the radio booms
Paging you six times
Call you on your cell but it's just a bad line
It's a full moon so I'm bout to howl
Thinkin for a slight, "Is my girl on the prowl?"
Naw, I guess she wouldn't violate us
Plus hittin' gets for real and she doesn't like to fuss
Callin up the shorty that I met four weeks
On the street, lookin sweet, and I was about to eat
Conscious of my lady but we was on the outs
Had mad love but I had mad doubts
On the phone talkin, gettin on my swerve
But thinkin bout my lady, guess I had some nerve
We was still dreamin and I had a little shot
Cause I didn't even hear it when the door unlocked
"Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?"
Now she standin over me, I said "I gotta go"
Turned around quick but I hung it up slow
"What's the deal, love, what's goin on?
I see it in ya face, just tell me what's wrong"
"Mm, nothin, I think we need to speak"
"Mm, okay, well, just have a seat"
She wears a frown, she lookin 'round
Sweat comin down and she doesn't make a sound
Tappin on the table growin impatient
I'm gettin up and now I start pacing
She says "Alright!" as she starts to conversate
"I'ma do what you do" then I say "Elaborate"
"Well you got that girl on the side
What if I had a guy then, too?
Would your heart be broken, boy?
I'd wonder what you do"
"Are you tellin me you got a dude
Who's lovin you better than me?"
"No, but I caught ya ass
So I guess I'm settin you free"
"Yeah, whatever" as a standin pride
"Me and her is only friends though, we never end, yo
We're gonna still tie intimate ends, yo
I think so, my shit is on lock, ho"
"Word? That's how it's goin?
Well I guess it was really good knowin"
"I'ma still just keep in contact"
"Oh, no, there's no need for that"

[Hook]
We got somethin'
For all of y'all
We like to play
We like to ball
This is a song
For all of you
When we do our thing
We got to do it true[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
In this American metropolis filled with MC's
A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease
Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody
Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin'
The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau
To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
A god-fearin' folk cos we all from the yolk
Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
Even though not too long ago I was a truant
Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats
Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat
But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?
It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable
I be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet
And fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year
All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near
All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest
It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess
So I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps)
Wit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)
Step back, me no have no time for dat
I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots
In a world where you have like a zillion MC's
Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs
Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know
I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low
(His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat)
Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross
Queens representation, son, you know how we do
While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest
I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat
Yo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that
My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop
Come on party people, you must give me my props
Cos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered
So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards
Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?
Queens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner

[Outro]
We feelin' pressures in here
You know we feelin' pressures
Feelin' pressures in here
You know we feelin' pressures
We gotta stand clear
Jus' gotta stand clear
Gotta gotta stand clear of the pressure
The what?[Intro: Q-Tip]
Yo, we all got different things that we got to deal with, you nam'sayin? Sometimes, I think people always want to put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at ourselves. Recognizing that a lot of the stuff that happens... sometimes has to do with other things. But if we look within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense sometimes, you know? It's about relating back to the essence, you nam'sayin', where it all stems from. So I'mma do my thing over the drum like a Native Tongue, you know? Yeah, buss it

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real
Complicated with the skills over reel to reels
Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal
Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill
Constantly, I'm hearing Black Americans just sneering
Looking for a leader who can fill us up with ether
Heating us up with great emotional chat
About the fact that the black's constantly held back
Like 50 tracks back in a relay race
And the white team's ahead, so let's keep up the pace
And I be needing something that could feed my logical taste
At the end of the race is there a paradise place?
Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing
Material gains we put too much in pursuing
("Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party, man, word")
But we can all Mardi Gras-di minus that shit in our body
("Yo, what that got to do with that?")
'Cause, kid, that's the essence
Your physical presence embodies every lesson
You can't run the Rolls Royce if the engine is busted
Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard
What we need to do first
Now listen to this verse
Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate
Recognize your existence in this vast blue space
From a tiny cloud of blood to the human beings with taste Sight, touch, smell and sound, let's deem it profound
And prioritize this 'cause it was Allah's wish
("Allah? Yo, I'm God")
("I don't believe that. That's a mystery")
("If God is so good, yo, why this shit be happening to me?")
There's divinity within because we come from the divine
A force that's not seen but, yo, we feel it every time
When the wind blows, and the Earth turns
And the rain drops, and the babies cry
And the birds fly, and the grounds quake
And the stars gleam
Yo, so many things are evidence of His existence
What we need to do is link it with persistence
Hear me out
Yo, once we recognize then we can move ahead
Native Tongues, Common Sense, yo, he's Hip-Hop bred...

[Verse 2: Common]
From the spiritual world my film of life has developed
First person I lost close to me was Stella
Some of my mellows lost their mothers and their brothers
For them I feel empathy
But I ain't pouring out no fuckin' Hennessy
I pour my heart out when I see Dot out on the deck
Knowing two weeks ago he slap-boxed with death
I hear of niggas dying in the wind and on the news
But when it's somebody you know it hits you
And emotions get bruised
I ain't been in your shoes
I won't judge or knock you
The spirit of the ghetto say you got to
That scratch you gettin' from rock flippin'
Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'
Stickin' stores on the strip
I'm tired of Arabs giving me my change back
Devil bomb my yesterday, my tomorrow he never gave back
I lay back, looking at the ceiling, wondering what could I do
So my homies won't have to be dealing
Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better
Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life
That we have to put together, better ourselves
'Cause families we gotta raise
No matter how long the money, shorter become the days
Men become like wind, ain't no difference in the season
If you got popped five times, you breathing for a reason
Let's put this five-, ten-year come-up plan in progression
Before we count our papers, count our blessings

[Outro: Q-Tip]
And there you have it
You know you got to grab it
It's all good, naw'mean?
Let's make it clear: the Native Tongues is in here
The JBs, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Common Sense
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode, naw'mean?
You got The Ummah, Beatnuts, Rah Digga
Consequence, Mos Def, naw'mean?
Black Sheep, Beatnuts, Queen La, Mo Love, naw'mean?
Native Tongues up in here, don't forget it
Raphael Saadiq
Yo, we out, peace[Intro]
I’mma deal with a bigger insult, man
The heat, the heat, the heat, the heat
It's comin' down hard
We’ve got to get our shit together

[Chorus: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
It’s time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s get it together, come on let’s make it
Gotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it
To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let’s make something happen

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Jarobi]
Word to Phifer
Gonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco
Chilling with the gold microphone cords
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour
'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
We about our business, we not quitters
Not bullshitters, we deliver—we go-get it
Don’t be bitter 'cause we not just niggas
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth
Ain’t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off
Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten soft
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost
They planning for our future, people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it’s happening, you feel it y’all?
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going
Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know

[Hook]
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck
(Move on to the stars)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude

[Chorus: Phife Dawg]
Time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won’t hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make make make
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make make make
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make, make, make
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen

[Outro]
The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they’re certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing!
"We’re there!"
"Where?"
"Here!"
A small step for mankind
But a giant step for us
Oompa, loompa, doopa dee doo
I’ve got another puzzle for you[Intro]
I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is...

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Busta Rhymes in effect
Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky in my rap and that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the jim, cos it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil
Write my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil
The rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart
A perfectionist at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, or deeper still the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I use that to break her

[Chorus: Q-Tip & Vinia Mojica]
Phife is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)
Uncle Mike is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)
Bob Power is in the house (you got it going on)
Tim Latham is in the house (and on and on and on)
Wise Men is in the house
The Brand Nubes is in the house
The J Beez, they in the house
And De La, they in the house

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
Some women in the 90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle
Africano lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
To Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking
Through the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas
Blasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

[Chorus: Q-Tip & Vinia Mojica]
Craig is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)
Pete Rock is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)
CL is in the house (you got it going on)
Ultramag is in the house (and on and on and on)
Nice and Smooth is in the house
Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house
Special Ed is in the house

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And this one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
And check it out, going into the '91 decade
Up in until the 2000 decade
You gotta say the Quest is on
And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on
And we out![Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Let me flaunt the style, I think that the time's near
That we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here
Rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
But when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
Now I'm not for the rock, I know the territory
Go ahead and try, that's a different story
Similar to Grimm, I could tell a better one
All about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some
No never ever, go back and try again man
If you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
The Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts
Do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
We know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
Gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
If the hands clap I'm filled with elation
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream
Cause that's how good it feels child
Let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
Do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
Division we will fall, we must stick together, see
I'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G
The name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder
Giving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa
As a man in the world, I must do my job
Take care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob
Bob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness
Obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
Like shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks
The industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
Peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
Not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it
I'm just a short brother, dark skin face
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist
Hair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley
To this day I still believe that no MC can serve me
Brothers try to front, but everybody know
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show
Party animal I was, but now I chill at home
All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit, and bone
Found my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island
Fudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling
Go out on my own, something that I gotta do
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
Yo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble
Rest in peace

[Interlude: Q-Tip]
Word Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?
We got, we got, we got the vibes
All the people in Long Island, we got the vibes
Brooklyn and Queens, we got the vibes
Uptown and Now Rule, we got the vibes
People Upstate, we got the vibes
If you're in DC, you got the vibes
Maryland, Virginia, Carolina vibes
Out West, we got the vibes
In the Bahamas, we got the vibes
Over in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes
And we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Of rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums
Good with the girls, I get a whole lot of 'em
From fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie
Emma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy
Cause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side
I don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
It's only legendary, my father well prepared me
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot
Better yet the long term, I don't have a perm
In a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps
I'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy and I'm nappy
When I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands
It's as good as grand like that

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Yo, I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble
And to uh... Trouble T Roy
And to um... Scott La Rock
And to um... Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin?
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what I'm saying?
This is a special, special, special, special, special dedication
And also to my Pops and also to Vinia's Moms, you know what I'm saying?
You just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going
Cause this is vibes and stuff, and we out...[Intro: Phife Dawg]
Girl, you know it's you I love and not another
You may change, but I will never
Come down...
Check it
Looking at your face, you're no betting man
Watch my poker face expose your hand
Them cats sitting out in a caravan
Watching me and you walk, holding hands, uh

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, you, you, you

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
Just came back from watching the game
Allen Iverson putting cats to shame
Now I see you and I ask your name
Think about  putting you in the frame
Notice how I saw your face before
In Michigan, R. Kelly tour
Nah, you never saw no parts of the Mo'
Straight New York, I hear you, yo
Probably I saw you in a dream
Well, anyway, here's the deal it seems
Tonight, you and me, we going out
Gonna see what life is all about
But word, true, word, you have no man?
No one to share your spotlight or your plans?
Now I'm ready to front for you (front for you)
Visions of us, I'm wanting you (wanting you)

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you
I am wanting you, I'm wanting you, come on

[Verse 2: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
Looking at your face, your'e no betting man
Watch my poker play expose your hand
Them cats sitting out in the caravan
Watching me and you walk, baby grins
'You know them cats?' "Nah. Who they is?"
Ebonically, you runnin' off at the jibbs
Got to my house, checked the messages
Some cat talkin' 'bout (ya didn't know)
Now is this what is meant to be
When we try to live more comfortably? (come on)
Making these advances all in vain
It seems that you don't recognize the name
All I really wanted was making you mine
Addition to my world so we could shine
Why didn't you tell me you had some plans?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Had a man, had some plans
Had a man, had some plans...[Hook]
We can get down, we can we can get down (Repeat x8)
It's like that man, it's like that (yes!) (Repeat x4)
Check it!

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
Stepping on my critics, beating on my foes
The plan is to stay focused, only then I can grow
Straight from the heart, I represent hip hop
I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closing the shop
Crushing competition like Italians on grapes
My rhymes styles be blending like a Ron G tape
My man where ya going, you can't escape
When the Tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define
The music of our youth from 1979
We rap by what we see, meaning reality
From people busting caps and like Mandela being free
Not every MC be with the negativity
We have a slew of rappers pushing positivity
Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap
So Mayor Barry smoking crack, let's preach about that
The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter
When I talk, I know I'm talking for Hip Hoppers all around
You know you love the sound, we gets down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream
I'm the mystic thought inside your dream
Listen to the way we pulsate the jam
I'm the nigga here with the mic in hand
Styles that we present are just a few
To do away with you and your hum drum crew
This is '93 and the shit is real
Black people unite and put down your steel
Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
Devote it to your lover and make it thrive
The rhythm's in F, I'm a hip hop body
Release my energy with the force of a shotty
Standing on the wall with my Polo on
Talking to the girl with the Liz Claiborne
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack
Got my Timbo hooves and my Doublemint pack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
I can do a trick with the opposite breed
I used to down 40s and smoke grade weed
Now, I'm doing shows with half loot down
Now it's time for me to take ya uptown

It's like that man, it's like that (yes!) (7X)
It's like that man, it's like this, Shaheed!

Shaheed:(scratching)(until end)
Rakim: "Why waste time on the microphone"

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Check it out
Her name was Knick-Knack-Patty-Wack, her ass smokin' bones
Yo, I've been on the throne since was walkin' stoned
Got the same job, pimpin' these slugs like Freddie Foxxx
I'm loungin' on the block on some brand new like Thomasina
Step in my arena and get murked like Selena
'Cause once you go 'Quence, you never go back like Ed
I rip shit to make crews bounce like great head
You open like you dusted
I be reppin' for more bad guys  than when you're a tussler
And when it comes to chicken, son, I'm Phifer dude
The Fresh Prince of Linden, you could lick my crown jewels
And black, you know I never slack in the mack
'Cause Razor been through more ladies than Big Kap
And when it comes to willie, pull your Hanes up
L for us, we come strapped

[Chorus: Consequence]
Yo, we stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me

[Verse 2: Consequence]
Yo, boom, I ain't Game Boy, or a bunch of ladies' man
My Tribe got more wins than Indians in Cleveland
I keep chicken seasoned, got rap on lock like the precinct
I'm the reasoning that Janet wants to runaway
Okay? So watch whatcha say like Chaka
We don't half-step, we bring it to your snot locker
And I got a style Praswell ain't ready for
Graduate of 5-1-6 so I could drink away the pain like ready for
We runnin' up in spots and more addresses than Gettysburg, ya heard?
Yo, I be a tough act to follow, get the cheese like nacho
Naw'mean, Pancho? I'm on some fly like Tom Hanks in Apollo
So Linden Boulevard, is you wit' me like Puba?
We rockin' diamond links like this is only built for Cuba
I'm on some brand new like Oprah's hairdo
And when I come through, niggas know my stee
Representin' for Queens and LB, to have a million dollar dream, baby

[Chorus: Consequence]
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends

Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me

Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends

Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me

Weekends, weekends, weekends, weekends, weekend
It's not Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,Thursday
It's not Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go

[Bridge: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go

We'd like to say to all of those people around the world, all of those people who are pushing people who are in power to represent them...tonight, we represent you. And we also dedicate this to our brother who's not here, Phife Dawg

I don't want to move backwards no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?
I don't want to move backwards, no

(I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand)
(Sing it
Sing it)
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?

[Chorus: Anderson. Paak]
I spun around without a care
When I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere, yeah yeah
I don't want to move backwards, no
I can't go back in
(Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction)
Can't listen in, hey
I don't want to move backwards, no

[Verse 5: We The People]
[Busta Rhymes (Consequence)]
Hey yo Consequence
(What up Bus')
[I'm not feeling the political climate right now?]
(Yo I feel you, I feel you)
I just want to thank President Agent Orange
(What up Cheeto?)
For perpetuating all of the evil that you've been perpetuating throughout the United States
(Wall)
I want to thank President Agent Orange for his successful attempt at the Muslim ban
When we come together

We the people
(Let's go)

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-brother mood
When we get hungry we eat the same [?] food

Babies babble on, they lookin' for excuses
Game for the buzzer who kicked it to the mooses
Lame as a brain, could be, golly gee
If you see a shrink he'll charge you a fee
If you see me ya see the fee is nothing
Fee will be for patience, all backs no fronting
What is a party if it doesn't really rock?
What is a poet? All balls, no cock
What is a war if it doesn't have a general?
What's Channel 9 if it doesn't have Arsenio?
What is life if you don't have fun?
What is a "what?" if you ain't got a gun?
What's Ali without Shaheed Muhammad?
Nothing, Kapelka makes you vomit
What is a Quest if the players ain't willing?
What is a pence if you don't have a shilling?
Excuse me if I'm chillin', hey what, say what
What's a fat man without food in his gut?
What's a child birth, without the umbilical?
What's United Parcels, without the deliverer?
What's momma-san, without poppa-san?
What's martial arts without Daniel-San?
What's Rasheed without Tonya, Tamika?
What's Oran Juice and Doug E. Doug without Shaniqua?
Nada, nada, nada, not a damn thing
What's Duke Ellington without that swing?
What's Alex Haley if it doesn't have Roots?
What's a weekend if you ain't knockin' boots?
What's a black nation, without black unity?
What is a child who doesn't know puberty?
What is my label when I exit womb status?
What's menage a trois, or, that is
What is sex when you have three people?
What are laws if they ain't fair and equal?
What's Clark Kent without a telephone booth?
What is a liquor if it ain't 80 proof?
What are the youth if they ain't rebellin'?
What's Ralph Kramden, if he ain't yellin'
At Ed Norton, what is coke snortin'?
What is position if there is no contortin'?

Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo
Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement

[Verse 2: Jarobi]
Melanated shrouded in complexity
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain
I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin'
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons
Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems
Every voice devoid of the truth
Come on, listen

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Man look at this, man look at this
Whatever will be will be
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams
Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killers' capture
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way
The rarity is in the rear, but never today
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play
On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone
And from that lie, young leaders will rise
In the eyes of despair and adversity
In some universe, this verse will be true

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl
And the weakest amongst them, they will fall
But the strongest in faith, they will stand tall
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia
'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia
'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria
Let's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia
Green and the white, we servin' that Nigeria
North side of Queens, one-nine-two is the area
This is for my dawgs from Shih Tzus to Terriers
Fuck it, it's showtime, Tip, make sure they hearing you[Chorus]
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Yo, we preparin ourselves for this ultimate war
The MCs are really lost and it's at a big cost
We be rhymin' at our show thinkin we gettin' dough
Movin throught every town off the fumes of...
And accolades of the crowd with our chests out proud
Yo, we 'bout to pack these joints so that these, sound loud
Some kids be actin' stank like a baby pant
It's the rapper Abstract that makes the joint get amped
Yo, use your body maker and use your minds, to break true
Yo, we gotta do the do
Son, we livin' in a time where mad folks talk (shit)
Representin' they crews or they East-West clicks
Let me tell everybody from coast to coast
About the lands we boast, but we don't own jack
How the (fuck) we movin' through makin' moves like that?
How the (hell) we movin' through makin' moves like that?
Can you explain that? I doubt that, very highly
We got jewels and Mo and the life is type rowdy
Everybody lookin (shitty) like a to' down committee
Let's make these institutions, body slam for the smitties
I got girls with plenty tails, smarts and big (titties)
And they all stressin' me, yo, really?
What really goes on? (I-I-I-I-I don't know)

[Chorus]
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
One is for the beat and the two is for the rhyme
Three is for the life, now we on this incline
Never catch this kid stickin forks in swine
Never ran my gibs in nuthin less than a dime
A few of my brothas did that asshole one time
Strivin miss sunrise sometimes is known as crime
The three twenty-five got that Windex shine
And when I shot skelly, I had my boxes in lines
All I wanna do is live life and be fair
I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair
Now, I want a woman with a spiritual flair
God will never make it too hard for me to bare
I'm hungry like a derelict whose stays in the diluse
Some can count me out, but yo, I doubt that I lose
The Westernized world got our minds confused
You frontin on me, ak, then you don't get bruised
The funny style cats, they'll be playin' games like Chucky
Government officials shoot their same old...
Made of devil agents a.k.a. the devil flunky
Stiff (ass) squares gettin' mad cause we funky
This the crap game, then we got the top rolls
The positive jumps the negative like frogs
Resentin evil vibes, yo, that (shit) is at the morgue
We celebrate laughin' down in at the smorgas borg
You still lookin' (shitty) like a to' down committee
Let's make this institution, buy the land for the smitties
I got girls with tails, plenty smarts and big (titties)
And they all stressin' me...really

If you make a promise
I can see me being around
Know that I'm beside you
Promise you won’t let me down

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Since you the wife, you takes mine, I takes yours
Sun and Bourget, 40 states and brochures
Don't want a thing, baby girl, this all yours
Honeymoon nights make you mine on seashores
Model in glaze, and the, them finger waves
Me and Miss Thing doing duets in hurricanes
Eric Clapton songs, watch your world change
You headline my mine, got me stuck on front page
Gregory Hines, so mines tap by the bays
Bedroom wit'cha, long nights and short days
The way to keep you jonesin’ 'til the sun comes up
Mos def, girl, you got me love songed up
So, uh, did it so proper, let's keep this abrupt
I see you in the cut, boo-boo, so boo, get up
I see you in the cut, I see you in the cut
I see you in the cut, boo-boo, so boo, get it up

[Chorus: Coko]
If you make a promise
I can see me being around (I see you, you see me)
Know that I'm beside you
Promise you won't let me down

[Verse 2: Consequence]
Your boy met his queen bee, your first kiss tastes like honey
Love triangles of black burner jacks is sunny
Jeff Van Gundy, calling plays from Coach bags
Crucial Conflict, love they stack, take slow drags
Tryna ask Whitney 'why it hurt so bad'
Who riffin'? I got a planet for racks, just got bags
So many streets, shore to shore, I’m still fishin’
What kind of man would I be, now my dreams are mint condition
This love is a house, taking me home like Fox Brown
My boo, your words cut through with DJ's from Ghost Town
Slow it down, you know who you wit’, mami
Shock to your drive, Fashion Ave, and you got me
So keep falling, catch you with the arms of Montell and
Home again, don't be afraid to ring my Ricky Bell and
Whatever you selling, dirty girl, yo, I'm coppin'
I see you, boo-boo, so keep rockin’

Q-Tip:
Power. People really get caught with this on different levels
Power controls your life
Money: The companion of the first. Some people tend to worship
And we know this ain't right

Phife:
Attitude (attitude) is how I get my point across
You can't call yourself an MC if you know that you're soft
Aggressive...is how the stage is approached. I burn MCs like toast
Cuz I'm the host with the most

Consequence:
Illin(illin) is what you do when you're assin
Whether it be you or all up in your fashion...
Cashin...it turns your people corrupt
It's six o'clock, yo, you gotta get your weight up

Q-Tip:
Sex(sex). Either a man or a woman
It's a gender, or when lovers get down
Froggin. When niggas try to play roles
But when they really need to put that shit background

Phife:
Miserable(miserable) is what your whole crew will be
If you're not original and you show no strategy
Heavenly...is how the track tends to flow
And if you don't know, tell em diggy said so

Q-Tip:
We livin this cuz it's deep in our bones
A Tribe Called Quest with this hip hop jones
So sit and analyze the lyrical spray
Cuz all it really is is word play(word play)(word)

Consequence:
Willie. That's what I kick to get this Millie on a lilly
Now, I'm baggin dimes like Chilli
Stress(stress). That's what I always go through
Cuz it's survival of the fittest on the 192

On this plane of livin, knowledge be the key, black
Understanding. Gettin a grip on what's revealed
When shit be real, can't give understanding back

Q-Tip:
Freestyle(freestyle). A true MC trait
And when you do it ill, niggas respect it as great

Phife:
We livin this cuz it's deep in our bones
A Tribe Called Quest with the hip-hop jawns
So sit and analyze the lyrical spray
Cuz all it really is is word play(word play)[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
The taste of nuthin, this does somethin
Mom's got no back, says I'm frontin
Call me Smiley, cuz I'm wiley
Living life like the life of Riley
Smokin' blunts with a boy named Bud
We cough up your lungs, cough up your cud
Put out fires, with a 40, ounce of water
You know you oughta
Dance to this, the girl you kiss
I like fried foods, especially fish
Afrocentric, I'm electric
Socialistic and eccentric
Body's healthy, mind is wealthy
Thoughts, they flow, that will propel me
To be a Native, get creative
Original and designative
Listen to the line that's playin'
Listen hard to what Q's sayin'
Politicians are magicians
Make your vote, they hope your wishin
Ambiguous words, senseless verbs
They all amount to crap that's heard
Violent hip hop, money flip flops
Promoters won't book, but it still rocks
I'm a Zulu, yes, a true blue
Red Alert is with the poo-poo
Ozone layer, loses flava
Here's the edge that you will savor

[Interlude: Jarobi]
The economy... Politics... Police... Everything
Except for the youth
But the youth about to come back

[Q-Tip]
Alright, here they come
Uh oh, uh oh, uh!

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
With expressions and I'm guessin
19 years is a youthful lesson
Fallin skies babe, open eyes babe
Can't you see what lays inside babe
Makin mentions on this tension
Rhythmic lovin, my profession
Hips, they gyrate, scripts I narrate
No banana, I ain't a primate
Ain't no soul glo, just an afro
The head is bred to let the thoughts grow
Quest together, to lands of never
Sleet and snow and storms can't sever
Tribe is growin, never know when
For this time, six necks may show in
Dialogues have been accepted
Negatives have been rejected
That's the music, negro music
Is here for all, so you must choose it
Phonies fondle, watch it throttle
3-6-5 straight out the bottle
Bustin caps, finger snaps
I prefer the second for ghetto tracks
Phife, Jarobi, Ali told me
Get the force like Wan Kenobi
Force his teachin, beats are screechin
Poly plateaus, we aim for reachin
Tribalization, freaks the nation
A mass of peers in celebration
Hopes been real high, since the knee high
Days of youth, feelin good and real spry
Avid combos, hear those bongos
Boom cacka boom, that's how they go
We ain't nomads, but we real glad
Hip hop slams through the nineties, no fad
As a rhythm, have been given
Hurry up, become, we breakin out, out

[Outro: Ali Shaheed Muhammad]
With a rhythmic instinction to be able to travel
Beyond existing forces of life
Basically, that Tribal
And if you wanna get the rhythm
Then you have to join a Tribe
Word, peace[Intro]
Act One: Scene 4

[Chorus]
Yeah, run, Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump, nigga, jump
Come here they come, run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga done

[Verse]
Son of a god, son of a bitch
Son of woman and man, son of a sun, in a sunken abyss
Summon a plan, please come with a script
Cover my back, cover man, please come with the blitz
Look at the stats, J.I.D like a magician
Fuck that, this some real ass shit, I paid blood for this
Taking cheese from the government
Cereal boxes with the bugs in it
Hand me down, this my brother brother's shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas
In the city, boy they say they fucking with you
Heebie jeebie, that's a bit disgusting but I get it
I'm full attention, full of spirit but full of shit
Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And ya dumb, dumb, better run, run 'cause we fryin' em
Eastside, where ya from, from niggas wildin'
So be silent before my niggas creep silent
With street knowledge, complete nonsense
Delete comments, online, all lies, we see violence
Every day in my eyes, they killing my niggas, die, nigga die
Pull up with the fye, get 'em nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it nigga, ride for the ride of ya life
Diabolical minds, I don't mind it, I like it, I like it, I love it
I fuck with you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

[Chorus]
Yeah, run Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump nigga, jump
Come here they come run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga-[Intro: 6LACK]
Your best shit ain't better than my worst shit, yeah
Ain't better than my worst shit, yeah, mm

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Your best shit ain't better than my worst shit, yeah
Don't call me underrated, you ain't heard shit, yeah
Work like a vet, and know I don't work for a check
But I'ma run it up, you can bet
Fuck the competition, I'll impress myself
Don't need to watch me, you should check yourself
So much on the shelf, that if I take a verse off the shelf
It probably break the Earth, raise Hell
Burn like 8701
Ushered in a new flow for the old one
Her pants too tight, I don't hold no gun
But Jiddy-Jid bookbag probably hold one
I keep a smile on my face when it's all bad
Record labels on my line, I ain't call back
And your girl on my line, I ain't call back
He got his eyes on the prize and they all mad

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Aye, shit, it's like as a reminisce I'm doing well, yeah
Buying with my 9, bitch it ain't the smell, no
My nigga caught the charge, yeah, he caught the L
He down the road now, send him some mail, uh
Get it while the gettin's good, I had to get it together
I was gathering my goods for the inclement weather
Trying to make it heavy and heard, your shit was light as a feather
That's fine, get it together, you can do better
You can be whatever you gon' be but you can be never
J.I.D the monster, mayhem and tax by the letter
Let us pray for those who thought it was a game or child's play
Somebody answer, take the floor and I'll wait

[Outro: J.I.D]
Your best shit ain't better than my worst shit, yeah
That .40 on me now, I disperse shit, yeah
Heard what I said, let 'em twerk, drop they berk shit, yeah
But she ain't even heard the kid yet
Serve shit, off purpose, on point with a smooth work shit
On purpose, outpatient, might surface

[Skit]
Nah bruh (huh?)[Chorus: J.I.D & Marian Mereba]
And if I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
'Cause if you looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle the truth, you can't handle it, ahh
And if I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
'Cause if you looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle it, you can't handle the truth, no

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
And if I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
Baby, do you love me? I know that you do
I been trying so hard, I know I gotta be real with you
Can't be playing with hearts, I know you feel like you feel it too
I'm gon' step into the shade
I don't want the sun in my face, but I don't want to walk away
Without me saying what I have to say
And I been praying it's another way
But it's like mayhem on my fucking brain
I gotta say, I'm finna go insane, shame, shame
And I don't know what I can do (fuck)
'Cause maybe you're past I
And maybe your last guy was probably just right for you
And baby, I can't fight the truth
Baby, I can't provide the proof
And baby, I can't fight with you, yeah

[Chorus: J.I.D & Marian Mereba]
And since I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
And since you're looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle the truth, you can't handle it
And since I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
And since you're looking for the proof, it's all there
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth
You can't handle the truth, you can't handle the truth, no

[Bridge: J.I.D & Marian Mereba]
And since I'm trying to tell the truth
So tell me why you got to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?
So tell me why you got to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?

[Verse 2: Marian Mereba]
See I'ma call it off here, boy this intuition ancient, oh
You ain't even really gotta say shit
I peep your in-the-cut shit, yeah, I'm a sharp motherfuck-er
No peace 'til we sleeping
We find reasons for deceiving
And then we both been keeping secrets
I remember when it felt like a dream
I hope it's a blessed world
Though I bet your next girl won't tell you the truth, like I do
It's just we were coasting on a new high
You never let slip that hand on my hip
It was Heaven, it was bliss 'til it flipped right
I ain't finna lie to you though
I ain't finna cry, never mind that you lied
That you spilled milk all on my clothes (fuck)
They say you reap what you sow
Lord knows that's some lies I've been told
Oooh watch it grow

[Outro: J.I.D & Marian Mereba]
And I done finally heard the truth is all bad
I wasn't looking for the proof, but God damn
Come on baby, you should tell the truth, but baby fuck the truth
I can't handle it, you can't handle it

[Outro (Spoken): Mereba]
You got me extremely fucked up[Verse]
Nigga don't worry 'bout me
Just worry about yourself
You better grab your pockets 'cause I'm coming for that wealth
And I be aiming for the chop, and I'm not talking about no shelf
And I be blowing on some shit they say that's bad for your health
And I can do it by myself, I don't need nobody
But I need my team to blow and that's word to young Roddy
And my words so crack, calling me a young Bobby
And everybody gone know me 'cause everybody gone watch me like Houston we got a problem
They know I'm from Richmond so they think I'm gone rob 'em
But they right, get 'em from my rights, I got problems
They know what I hold, but they think i'ma fold
I need money for shows, you use money on clothes
I pay attention to business, you pay attention to hoes
I said your mind on the wrong things
Tell 'em fuck the unncessary and small things
Niggas killing for territory and drug claims, it ain't the same thing
It ain't the same game, but I play my position so I can maintain
These niggas stuck in the traffic up in the same lane
I think smarter, but nigga we got the same brain
I use it different, I stress my people to listen
I'm telling you cause I lived it
Don't hesitate, go and get it
I'm talking to myself and all my niggas that's with it
So we can be better than niggas that did it
Intelligent and I'm gifted, you better watch your back
If you close to edge, you better watch that crack
My niggas close to that bread so they keep that MAC
It's a lot of bad apples, better watch that batch
It's like a movie, truly up in the making
You can see it for yourself like you was watching the Matrix
Don't take a pause, I'm telling niggas be patient

[Outro]
Now let's start the show

Now let's start the show
Now let's start the show
Now let's start the show
Now let's start the—[Verse 1]
I never made my bed when I wake up
I never had a job and if I did, I'd quit it after the pay cut
Swinging on the branches, a gorilla in the night
Don't wanna wake up the lions, tell your boys [Tread light and step soft.]
Wake up the kush with the iced coffee
I often dissolve diluted rappers with dissolvent
Ballsy young brawler jaws clenched snarling
Growling a hundred and fifty pounds of astounding
Throw my E's Up from Cali to stone mountain
Can't my mind on my dome
Dammit if I stood on my money, I'd shrink a little bit
Being broke make you think a little bit
Not a bit about the shits
If you with it, then how you gon' get it
High in the kitchen dodging cop shots and the swastickas
Shorty all fine and provocative, for now I need oxygen
But later we could get it popping, Mary Poppins
Cause you all fly and you popular
The “X” man.] tripping
He outside of the Waffle House, he's got the choppers out
Put down that bacon where all that beef you that you was talking bout

[Verse 2]
Screws missing maybe
Screws losse [?] I'm missing daily
Ain't no time to waste now, I'm out [?] the pavement
Playing on the phone, what you want you ain't finna play me
Orders raised, oh well, the first is on the [?]
Tryna meet me where I'm staying, just meet me where I tell you
Show me love on the scale bruh, you get just what I sell you
I'm stressed out, I used to do a lot, I do less now
So when niggas scheme and plot, I get left out
[?]
Got niggas asking how he rap so good
Cause niggas [?] cause they act so good
Every track identical from front to back, I can't listen
It's wack, don't be offended, it's just a nigga's opinion
Cause maybe if my shit ain't hitting when they hear my shit
And maybe my shit make [?]
I smoke chronic, I'm bout to show niggas how I'm a problem
And the ying-yang gon' wonder why I talk I talk, bitch

[Verse 3: Mike G]
I made it my life's purpose to put rappers in hearses
And move around this earth to acquire what I deserve
I got rhymes that will make beats need [?]
All these bitches should know my intentions
I'm playing hopscotch [?] these hot shots
Since we playing Scarface, [?] is my block
I promise I will never stop going in
Tell anyone who questions to guess again
And congratulations to whoever is next to win, but
I get love, sometimes I'm feeling like the President
These rappers are actors that should take five, go hide
I said [?] bring 'em alive
Hard enough to play this game called life try to survive
And knowing you get hate, you should take it and strive
Now I'm strolling through the south and I'm rolling through backwoods
I can bring [?] the world out the house
I can come out with purple rain in the drought
How could you live without this
I'ma show you all we gotta do is the best you could
To think like the most than your mind, I'm that good[Intro]

Okay, I could make a flash from a little piece of plastic

Or read Ecclesiastes, I'm cleaning up the Catholics

They coming at my back attacking
A tackle, a technical foul, travel
Babbling Babylon, brother, you ready for battle?
And, bitch, your bottom butler budicky

Worry when we walk on on the scene
My team the strongest
Team strong as us
Your bitch bitch belong with us
Yea in paper we trust
We on some strongest
We on the stongest
We on the strong shit

[Verse]
D-D-D-D-Damn, said I'm back again to whoop ass
The blicka-blast from the ratchet, man
The maddest, blackest lad in a savage land
Of grab and dash and crash in your daddy's van
D-D-D, D-D
Bad as the most havin'est, most swaggiest, braggy as never had anything
So I'm mackin' as if I never had shit
Eyes movin' backwards, I coulda hit a backflip, check this
I ain't never hustled for a necklace
Tryna get the fam straight, get us out of debt, shit
That shit get testy
I feel Dizzy Gillespie, in the room pack me, Carl, Izzy, and Precious
Out the womb, I was last, I'm the youngest of seven
Birthday same day as the reverend
Birthday same day as the devil
Black lock like the pot and the kettle
Wreck shop, a monotonous fellow
Lick a shot for the niggas tryna stop the journey
JID pull up on a opp like what's poppin' kermie
Blocka Blocka, operate, doctor, surgery
IVs, gurneys, shit bag, gone for eternity, hey
More the merrier, more to come murder me, hey
Close the casket, common the courtesy, hey
Head shots, too personal for a burglary, ooh
Red dots cause killers could close curtains me
I done did wrong, someone send me up vertically
Horizontally, read me a passage from Deuteronomy
Anything you can do to conquer the demon inside of me
Any meaning the truth and the father, the spirit guided me
I can bleed in the booth and leave a tooth as a souvenir for who was here
And if you hearing it, you know the spirit is imperitive, imperative, imperial
Black man pyramid, the peer of men, jack man with the gat
Scratching off the serial
Sack man, get the pack
Money in the envelope
Pissing down the urinal
Ass man in the strip club, tell 'em bend it over
Gon give it to her, she been working for it, hey
You gon' make a nigga cop a birkin for ya, hey
You the bomb, look I got a turban for ya, bae
Beat a nigga til he color purple for ya, babe
I'ma murder for you, babe
7:30 for ya, ay

[Chorus]
Swervin', swervin', swervin'
Skrrtin', skrrtin', skrrtin'
Servin', servin', servin'
Everything I done, it comes full circle
Workin', workin', workin', workin'
I-I-I'm swervin', swervin', swervin'
Skrrtin', skrrtin', skrrtin'
Servin', servin', servin'
Everything I done, it comes full circle
Workin', workin', workin', workin', workin'[Part I]

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
I know y'all thought it would be a minute before I got back at you
Para Tu's a classic, and I knew that
But y'all got me confused with the new cats
And the third member of that group with the other two cool cats
And that's cool, 'cause I knew that
But who thought I was coming with them cool raps
You should be boom-bapped in two slaps
I just light the flame, I'm J.I.D, I'm a new match
Wild and untamed, and I do the same to your boo, snatch
I'm in it like I'm Smith, Emmitt
Lil' Venice need money
I'm Trumping out the apprentice
Tell the judge, "Fuck a life sentence"
If I die, my cats [?] should have a mic in it
Doing my drugs like I'm Hendrix
I'm Jimi, grabbing my Jimmy
Who am I offending
Fuck a prosecutor, judge, come yell the defendant
Whole court fucked up so I ain't fuckin' with it
So fuck it, I'm spilling like what's good pimpin'
Heard niggas throwing shots, I'll flick it
That's a big bill for a midget
But to a big deal, that shit smaller than a chicklet
Back to the digits, I ain't got enough time to sit and wait
I got too much on my plate, too much to say
So that Para Tu 2's on the way
My partner came with the pair of new-news in the J
Maybe six or like seven, I don't know, it was an eighth
And some Hen with the chaser, but that was for the ladies
Now what the fuck I'm saying, I'm a fuckin' lightweight
Takin' shots like, "Wait, wait, wait"
I'm good now, then I take a 40 to the face
You singin' 40s to next like [?] dollars
Him pop on them rappers like Matt Hoffman
No problem, I done shot him, got a shotta, next they like
Guadalajara, Guatemala, Idaho, I don't know
Just somewhere to get me away if the feds on my chase
'Cause I sprayed it
I pray it never happen, But if occasion turn to fate
I'm punching niggas in the face, straight up
So follow the fuckin' leader, I'm kickin' my fuckin' feet up
Lookin' for competition outside of E-G, Mereba
And you see who on the feature
Then you featured in the bleachers
And I'm still fuckin' teachin'
And I'm still waitin' on that shit from Money Makin' Nique
He told you niggas you shouldn't sleep, I agree so
Every fuckin' rapper or record, I'ma eat, no feast
You niggas can join me so that's word to the Lion King
I'm on to some giant tings
I'm slaying Goliath, David, Goliath, them giant tings
Consultin' with Mayans, them niggas high in they lion things
This J.I.D, baby, and the "I" is for "I" in team
Spillage Village, killin'

[Interlude: Sy Ari da Kid]
Doc, this Sy Ari
This why they call me the best, B
Yeah

[Verse 2: Sy Ari da Kid]
Welcome to genocide
And then aside, it's J.I.D and Sy
Don't live a lie, just live alive
It's riverside, fool
Memorize then put the pen aside
The remedy to your enemy
I'm a friendly guy, who
These niggas is not your brother
They'll leave a nigga scarred like Mufasa brother
You got to love her
Nigga, that's from the block unguttered
Watch your mother, she purchasing a box of rubbers
I'm taking after her favorites
I'll leave my number on a old pic
Then erase it after she save it
I'm chasin' after the latest at my earliest convenience
Abe(?) vs. Cole(?), surely it's anemic
Got a girlie up in Phoenix
Garglin' my sons
Couple hunnid like some Instagrams
She modelin' for fun
Put the hollows in the gun
Shoot for the stars, biatch
She ain't even know it, Amber gave me the Reeboks, yeah
[?], you was tripping, you assisted in them hoes
Cool it now, new edition (Woo)
Yeah, I'm sexist, talkin' so rude to bitches
Tellin' hoes, "No, you can't watch the game with me, do the dishes"
Who the richest, well, let the broke niggas tell it
Young nigga moves make the old niggas jealous
You won't get the message if your nose didn't smell it
Sniff, sniff, sniff, yeah, don't, Cinderalla, don't choke
Niggas better go [?] for whatever
Those olks didn't measure, oh no, this shit never was me
Who knew my favorite letter was G
Who knew I'd take 'em back to the city like Metta World Peace
Let's cease, Sy Ari, yerr, ho, no bum sauce

[Part II]

[Interlude: Harry Belafonte]
People count on people who can only count to one
Genuine imitation life

[Verse: Doctur Dot]
Stupid revolution every [?] music
Keep my finger on the trigger, keep the temper for my niggas
Hoppin' out of the mosquito like the coldest winter
Interior dashiki on the flows and fixers
Y'all niggas must've missed it
See, you gon' have to get our 1-2-6-9
All of them senses, check into remissions
Dodgin' niggas like it's washing liquid floatin' in the park
Peaceful as a treaty with the sun and a thousand other stars
Got hand on the bum, other hand on the heart
Leaves [?] as we layin' in the night
Your pussy [?] up, she discussing human cycles
Steppin' at the same [?]
Leaves in my hair now, she's in my hair now
Ridin' like two trains destined for the stare down
Took me ten minutes just to get here
Take my time walkin' down the stairs now[Intro: J.I.D, Girl, Guy]
"You have to be the life coach!"
"I'm not trying to laugh"
"Haha! No real, like, real though, okay? What we suppose to be talkin' about. Well?"
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
I was on some other shit, now I'm back to this
I had my humble pie, now it's time to take a shit
She wanna suck my (Hahaha), only if you insist
Only because I'm lonely and only cuz I ain't shit
Of course she say she won't, then go on with the lists
I wanna slit my wrists, I'm horny as a bitch
Her brother and her sister act too, father crisp
She givin me her maybe's, she tellin me her if's
Her then statements, her family, even the rips
I tell her take a sip, grab her neck and start kissin
She said I'm too explicit, I'm thinkin like a midget
Gettin fisted, I just wanna stick it, maybe fifty
And I'm back to the digit, she think about it
"Mmmmmm", JID, don't be so sadistic"
I'm tryna get her to fuck, so this dick can get stuck
But she can't get, past the fact that I'm fuckin brilliant
Most niggas act, retarded off [static]
I don't really rap, I'm just followin the tick-ticks
The booms, and the claps, it just so happens
That the kid keeps it accurate, used to whip the Acura
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But now I'm grown and my women are gorg'
She prolly just want my heart, and to surrender the sword
But I'm a Ginsu warrior, slingin dick victoriously

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
You think you clever huh
You looking at me so passionate let me know that the nigga that you been tappin is actually unimpressive huh
Oh well
I see what I can do about you, see what I can do about you
You think you clever huh
You looking at me so passionate let me know that the nigga that you been tappin is actually unimpressive huh
Oh well
I see what I can do about you, see what I can do about you

[Verse 2]
Baby you interestin, and I'm interested after havin long sex
Eight sets of ten that's a long set
Bend that ass over like a long snap
She ain't say nothing just supply me with the bone grip
Tell me it's a full ass moon that shit glowing
Little nigga put your coat on your Scorpio showing
I never told her my birthday, not even the first date
And then I made it worse then my October the 31st
No wonder you kinda thirst
And then she laugh it off
You freaky nigga I wonder if you be jackin off
Bad bitch with a sense of humor
Fuck a fan it don't get cooler
Fuck your ice and your bed it don't get cooler
Think I won gettin cooler like I'm Don Shula
Got a piece like a damn Budda
Smoking a gram I'm the Grand Puba
Got a gun fuck your shooter anyway
Little shawty got me amazed
The fact, the fact, the blood leaving from my dick to my brain
It's cool how we converse never say conversate
She said I know I always had a way word with ways
Way with words, wayward sons lit up with jay
They finna leave, I'm finna to sleaze to the back room
Tryin see if I can get me a little vacuum
Before the moon change clothes with the sun
And presume another day another doom
She say if I stay then I got to sleep in the other room
I said it's cool cause around 3 I'll probably come and creep in your room

[Outro]
You, you ain't got to be so cold
You, you, you, you ain't got to be so cold (so cold)
You ain't gotta to be
You ain't gotta to be so cold (so cold)
You, you, you ain't got to be so cold
You, you, you ain't got to be so cold (so cold)
You, you, you ain't got to be so cold
You ain't gotta to be[Intro]
Ah
Chewy
Look

[Verse]
Alright its been time for war we got to get to it pronto
I hear the bongos in the Jungle
They let that horn blow
Hungry like biombo from the Congo
That thing "PLATT" like mutambo from the console
You know the boy's brought the drumsticks for the drumroll
Bra-brum-brum-pum the gifts come to your front door
Fuck that chimney dumping
That .40 viv intill its empathy no sympathy
Quite whining whimpering
Fucking simpletons
I walked through the valley of shadows
Escaped out of the gallows
Blood streams and puddles remain shallow is howling
Gwen poutro
Smoking on indo
Smell like out though
Man I gotta find a better plug in the south
I've been sleeping on this couch
I was up when niggas sleeping screaming "Demons won't get out!"
Please leave when I play
All your records be faeces
Wave that febreeze
BET trying to get of this EBT
BBC rocket
My niggas clocking
You see we see
We peep you sleep and we creep
Leave 'em leakin' so easily
P-90 four fivey one shawty one thotty
We outtie on niggas heads who be on instagram countin' his bread
Yeah you heard what he said
I'm on a paper route
Quick to take a neighbor out
.40 with the laser weight
For you meet your maker wipe that makeup of your face and mouth
Your circle been real out of shape
Just take a look around[Intro]
U-U-U-U-Uptown
Ayy, it's, it's all for the kids man
This-this shit for the kids, hahahah
For the little children, uh, um

[Verse 1]
I can be, whatever I want to be
Bet not a bitch or a nigga stand in front of me
I got the devil in the pockets of my Dungarees
Taking a dump on anything that standing under me
I can be a dream, yeah, or I can be a nightmare
Born on Halloween night, it seems like a light year
Double my Sprite, hey my guy, do you got a light? Yeah
Squash stampede, plenty lion and many bison, huh
Seen some, seen one, but it's not many like 'em
When I fry or when I die, bury me with many mics, yeah
I can be, whatever I want to be
Bet not a pussy ass nigga stand in front of me
Took a stop at the light, made a right on humble street
Guess I been buzzin' like a motherfucking bumblebee
Tryna turn this honey tree into a money tree
But it's only one of me, and y'all niggas the son of me
God

[Interlude]
Wait, wait if I win this, I
It's gonna be something, but I don't know what it's gon' be

[Verse 2]
Uh, okay I'm gonna be, whatever I want to be
Bet not a bitch or a nigga stand in front of me
They tryna snatch this motherfucking rug from under me
But never stumble, young man rumble, the sensei
The J.I.D babe, Mutombo, the brass ensemble
Cop an eighth and spend the last on paper and funds
So at Thanksgiving I'm your drunk ass uncle
On the corner, that junky that mumble
The little nigga that climbed the hair of Rapunzel
I'm the shrimp beside your gumbo, I make myself sick, damn
Dick down doctor, that's the J.I.D, give a health check
I'm the wrong letter that made it up out your spell check
Fucking up your texts, uh, I'm electric, I'm a Lexus
I'm the evidence, like the shell case when the shell hit
But I never tell shit, I'm cold
But the flowing come from the bottom like whale shit
I know what I know, and I know that you prolly fail shit
'Cause y'all niggas selfish, and my niggas desperate, damn

[Interlude]
Damn, fuck
I wish I knew, Black Panther, but he's not real
Fuck man, homie, I don't know
Not real
What you trying?

[Verse 3]
Um, look
They saying, "What you wanna be J.I.D? What you wanna be kid?
A doctor, a lawyer, exploring the coral reef shit?
A football player, a track sprinter, I know you run fast
Oh you gon' be a rapper with your dumbass
Just because you used to bump Caz
Talk fast and can tap a drum pad
You thinkin' that the world's going mad? Big head, short ass
Big eye, bug eye, drug head, shoo fly, don't bother me"
I'ma be better than y'all will be, tryna be, y'all see
All for one, all for me, shit, you niggas ain't all for me
Motherfucker with your offering, talk-a-talk-a-talking
She's a sober mind, I keep receipts
I beat the beat and eat the beat
So I could be the beat if I want to be
Me I call you one two the sun do
What the sun do rise when the gun drew
Would meet the devil in hell where niggas'll hunt you
When it's dark all around and you lookin' for some
But in the heart of the jungle, my nigga you run
You could be whatever you want, but better get you a gun
Better do what you want, whatever you feel in your stomach
Whatever you gotta do at the moment, only the strong survive
Only the strong in mind and soul and spirit and spine
You stand firm, you rise, it's go time!
He looks determined without being ruthless

[Outro]
I wish I knew, Black Panther, but he's not real
Yeah
Not real[Intro: Sean McVerry]
Yeah, hit me a little more
That's good, we rocking? Oh word

Everyone's a star (Everyone's a star)

You give me a month and I'll make a mountain move
You give me two months and I'll make a moon for you
It's still J.I.D. Route, just a little bit smoother
I pray for you
And I know it seems hard
When its crazy in your mind, but you know what's in your heart
At the top of the mountain where the Earth meets God
Seems far but
I pray for you
Seems far but
I pray for you, I pray for you
Seems hard
I pray for you
Seems far but
I pray for you

[Verse 1]
And I know you hate the sight of me
And everything I sit, jump, and stand for
But when you see me you know I'm doing good
Didn't mean to leave your world dismantled
Or you would say shambles
Gave ample time to blow out the candles
On to the next chick, thought it was a scandal
Now on to my ex something shorty couldn't handle
Its crazy but, I pray for you
And to those who wish I never make it
Hope you know I'm forever praying
Not for no jewelry or no wrist bracelets
But that I can change lives in my heaven placement
At the gates I, I pray for you, I pray for you
Don't stray, you'll make it, I'll make it too
I pray for you, I pray for you
You knew it, the fact that I'm a human
Mistakes, I'ma do it, pursue it, I pray for you
I pray for you, I pray for you

[Bridge]
Double triple joining souls step in
Step hoes step left, right directions
No hoes left
Show me something
Show me something
Show me how to prove my point
Always believed being last is best
Give me last
Even if you give me least I'll give complete
Why not?
Feeling this intrinsic interdependance
You knew me before your fingers had tips
And your tips had prints
And your prints had grooves
You knew
We know
You knew
We know
Even if no one else had the bag
Scars sustained
And cuts suspended
Completely free from both sides of the word "then"
Feel this reciprocity
Why not?
Worst case I'm back to first base
Woo
Hold me no confusion
Hold me no illusion
Promise is not on purpose
Purpose is not promise
Promise is not on purpose
I'll pray for you

{Verse 2}
Yah, four hundred something years
So many tears that it could start an ocean
Not to dwell in the past 'cause I live in the moment
You gotta know where you been to see where you goin'
See where I'm goin'?
The hoodies all black for a reason
The clothes all black for a reason
You probably just gotta see it
You hate that God called his angels back for a reason
Shit happens, reactions and actions
But still I pray for you, I promise I'll pray for you
Don't stress, you'll make it, I'll make it too
Because I'll pray for you, I promise I'll pray for you
Don't stress, you'll make it, I'll make it too
Yeah[Intro: J. Cole]
Yo, I'm in Atlanta, bruh
Hit me back, lil' nigga

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now, elevate my status to Gucci bag us
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slapped stupid
East side little Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm astoundin', stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
I'm under pressure, smoking pressure, walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo Young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

[Verse 3: Johnny Venus]
Niggas ain't seein' you Venus, shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills, my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm deep in premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my delivery
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time limit, I'ma take what's mine nigga
Hah, now elevate my status to Gucci bag us
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And yes them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Now, elevate my status to Gucci bag us
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

[Outro]
If you want to act up
If you want to act up
Come act up[Skit]
Nah bruh (Huh?)
What you talking bout, homes?
Ayy, ayy, nigga, Snapchat niggas twisted up real tight
I'm with my motherfucking brothers, nigga (Hahahahah)
They was representing for Trump real tight
But we in this motherfucker real tight
Nigga, ain't left, everything right
Nigga, I'm tight!
Nigga, fuck you talking about?
Bars forever, nigga!

[Intro]
Bars, bars
Me and my two, okay
Me and my two, alright, me and my two, okay

[Verse]
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy
I'm Zack, you AC, that Jessie and Kelly
I pull up to your hood, just let me know when you ready
I'm rolling up this dub, finna face it, beheaded, mm-mm
Hold on, chill out, please give me a second
I'm drowsy off a Xan, nigga, legs is spaghetti
Cut all of the bullshit, nigga, chop the confetti
You ready? I'm ready, you ready? I'm ready, uh, alright
Never sell weed cause I'm smoke it too much
I fuck up the pack, I don't fuck with the sack
And I mean the bread come quick
He told me bring him 300
I brought him excuses and like 200 or something
I mean most of y'all niggas love drugs like me
Love me like drugs, bitch, I might be
Yo' love light bulb, turn on lights please
Turn off your cool, I mean, I might freeze
I mean hold on, relax, please give me a chance
I was moving too fast, I ain't hear what you said
We was celebrating life, tryna get to the fetti
But me and my two niggas, we like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy, damn

[Outro]
Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy, Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy

[Verse]
Uh, bad taste in my mouth from a lad tate
But how this taste
Eat the plate, eat the cake
How it make out for your satisfied face, make you wanna slap your mom and break a vace
Shit, I mean't a voss
Valentine's day, sent a condom in the cart to your broad
I took a leap of faith, I'm J.I.D frogger
She knew I was the shit when the tolied bowl clogged
I could spot an ant on a tree in the fog
So easily I could see the bullshit in niggas talking
Twitter celebrities and pussy ass bloggers
If you knew the folks you said you knew, you probably wouldn't be talking
I told ya'll this shit was getting awkward, now this shit awful
I used to have one bitch, now I got a coffin
Used to have to cough, now I sip lean, so I'm snoring
Feeling like a brand new man in the morning
Yawning, howning, hungry
Shawty making eggs, waffles, and cornbeef hash
And I'm bout to go smash it after I smoke
After I smoke, then I'ma smash her
And she wants more after, but i gotta abracadabra
Gotta go, gotta dip, gotta go, got shit to do
And I know that probably don't mean shit to you
But no pressure, I could have her on the leash if I let her have her way
But I know it's something out there better
And mama told me never settle for the lessers (never ever)
Never, unless you
Your such a afradite
Your such a goddess
I probably knew a UFO in the orbit
But I ain't finna fuck around with the shwty
What you mean, bro?
I'm finna cool cous', I'm finna cool it
That's all I got, that's all I got

[Verse 1]
Check, anybody can see the kid got it
I see niggas ignore it so I feel a way about it
From rapping in that truck with bolts on and rolling blunts
Bagging a couple bitches and fucking them all at once
Friday night lights, I was catching and dropping punts
Thinking 'bout rapping, I could be J.I.D or like Chris Johnson
My thumbs keep strumming kinda like the Mumford & Sons
Mommy went dumb when she got that call, I had got caught
Kicked out of college for tongues, niggas be talking
I wasn't even on camera, just hit the lick with some amateurs
Glad we did that, now I'm flying to Los Angeles
With a 8th in my pre-rolls, call that shit a tarantula
Tarantino on your big screen, ho
Slave man, South East Coast, J.I.D or DiCap Leo
Set it off, my big sis reminded me of Cleo
And my brothers is killers you might see on Nat Geo
You gotta chill cause niggas can get they cap peeled
I keep that 40 like I'm Pat Tillman
They sent my nigga up the hill, yea they jack jill'd 'em
And a million other black children, let's crack the seal, I'm spillin'

[Chorus]
Alright, I feel amazing, I can feel the haters, do something
I ain't finna fade ya, I ain't got a taser, shoot something
Niggas talkin' crazy, wipe the little baby, too funny
Pull up on ya, had a crew coming, take a deuce on ya, hold up

[Interlude]
Hahaha, for real
I mean man, I did it man, talkin' 'bout for real, man
You had me doin' that, three in this shit man
You some dick, you guys had, you guys [?]
You had [?]


[Verse 2]
Look, look, alright
Looking for it in the night time, I been looking for it all day
I'ma get it at the right time, watch 'em fuck with me the long way
Watch a nigga at the bike whip, hit the buyer with the stone face
Greenbriar with the whole case, bust it down and flood the whole state
Bitches know when that work good, Anna Mae eat the whole cake
We ain't even gotta role play, had to get it out the bowl way
Kill shit, OJ, no way, Jose, slo-mo, okay
I don't do this shit at your pace, I ain't here to do it your way
And I'm coming through the ceiling
Through the floor, back and front door way
You do not want war, I swear, I swore on your grave
I been on my shit since like 6th, 5th, and 4th grade—wait
Even before grades, going to my brother court dates
And I asked my mom and dad what he did but they'd never tell me
Then I figured he killed a nigga or got caught for some dope he selling
Kinda close but no cigarillo, he was armored up, that's a armadillo
My pops did time in the military and he taught us how to disarm a nigga
See the boys, you better warn a nigga but J.I.D prolly got warrants, nigga
Like North Carolina or South Carolina, got the hideout in like Florence, nigga
Swear your raps so borin', nigga
Then you say you trap—you be lyin', nigga
I don't fuck with none of y'all happy trappers
Better grab and strap, people dyin', nigga, Lord
Sorry we making all the noise, but you ain't have to call the boys
Some shit you just can't avoid, dumb shit, coolin' with the squad

It’s that lil’, dirty, eastside, nappy-head phenomenon
Rumblin’, young man rumblin’
Tumblin’, twirlin’, troublin’
World got me losin’ my nerves, humblin’
‘Scuse me, sir, step out of my circumference
Pull up a chair, take off my shirt like I’m Gucci LaFlare
I’m the shit, nigga; Pepé Le Pew
Grab the stick, keep the weapon secure
Have a fit, let the message be heard
Every mothafuckin’ word, but I heard from a little bird
There’s been a surplus, an emergence of fuckin’ turds
It’s an emergency
Robbin’ you for your bread, it’s been a burglary
Dirty, little niggas, they ain’t worth the detergent
I could squeeze out of the bottle
Nigga, I came from the bottom
Shot out the top just like a rocket
Got the hops from my papa
Couple hots and that chick’ll block
Say sayonara, say sorry
Knock it out the park, J.I.D. Garciaparra
Pull up and handle it
Get off that Twitter handle
What you a man or a mannequin?
I don’t understand why you’re standin’ still
Nigga, hand it here
I was on the bedge—I was on the edge of a fantasy and abandonment
Took a couple pills out the cabinet
Fell upon my knees like I was Kaepernick
Slap a bitch, slap a rap nigga if he actin’ bitch—whatever[Intro: J.I.D & Chiiirp]
System overload (Overload system)
Watch the throne (You'll get overthrown)
At the bar drunk (Overthrown)
Under the influence (In the overcoat)
Roll up that kill (I'm tryna oversmoke)
Word to Mr. Willie Nelson (Now tell me what's a weed head overdose)
I'll wait (Let me know)
I got the flow (But I want all of the boatload)
So let me go

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
I told niggas, I ain't no rookie
I ain't no punk bitch and I ain't no pussy
I know pussy like a gyno
You are what you eat, treat the pussy like a gyro
Duckin' duckin' shots, duckin' cops, like the 5-0
Swerve on the beltway I drive with a blindfold
I unfold truth, palm reader just spittled
Eyes low, nigga tote a smith like Milo
Niggas act pussy, I thought you niggas was guys though
Absent dad, they need guidance, I spilt like a broke fire hydrant
"How you's a bitch?" My bitch shout when she spot 'em
Shawty a miss but there there she's a rider
Ridin' through the city with my nigga right beside me
And my bitch that I just scooped from pilates
The same one that popped at ol' boy, who shot ya?
Seemed kinda monotonous ol' boy, yo' posse
Start resemblin' pasta, pussy ass kids
Make me sick like shrimp, crab and lobster
Life is a film needin' a dope porn oscar
Dick chopper, blocka blocka
Young niggas hop off the block and fuck the block up
Just to get locked up and seen by the balls they got
'Cus by the bar and the law they talk
It's already and to owe a nigga menage a trois
I look up to the sky and thank God I are
A reflection of himself set inside my flaws
Set aside my sins, set aside my love
Silly bitch get inside my car
[?] bitch
Gotta go bitch
B-b-bitch
J.I.D bitch, uh

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
All black on at my wedding, bucket ass naked at my funeral
Can't 9 to 5 in no lil' ass cubicles
Boss yellin' at me, say it's weed in my cuticles
Put it on the scale, the rap shit lookin' beautiful
Stretch my palms into the atmosphere, I fear nothing
I hear I hear nothing, fuck a tear for buckets
Warren Buffett, buffet rap, dinner for lunches
Delightful, y'all seem spiteful
I too used to be a little bit like you
Nah who I'm lyin' to, if I was ever like you
I would need some pills, a knife, prob'ly a rifle
Somethin' I could die to
Anyways, they shine, I wan' shine too
Let the diamonds blind you
While the blood of the child who mined- never mind
I'm diggin' through your mind, do you mind? Whatever's fine
You very fine and I can't pay you no never mind
Light skin girl transform to decepticon
I'm tryna catch mine like megatron
But she don't hear me on the megaphone jack
This make a uhh hella bomb

[Outro: Marian Mereba]
Inside
You're all in a twisted mind
Other bright then go misfit ride
On your feet when you hear the sound
Inside
The diamond of mind of mine
What a find
There are no ordinary thoughts
In an extraordinary mind
Mind
Are no ordinary thoughts
In an extraordinary mind[Intro: J.I.D]
Come to my garden, it's for you
Euphoria, next level
Uni—[static] and [static]
You can start what you finish
Temptation is simply what you make it
Indulge, please
I want you to indulge
Every thump (everyone's a star)
Will run from your head (every day's the move)
To your toes (everywhere we are)
Close your eyes (you, yeah)
Get away (everyone's a star)
It's for you (every day's the move)
Only you (everywhere we are)
And there's the one thing you cannot forget

[Verse]
I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
All plans I got a scheme, consulted among kings
Spread my wings, I bleed
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around foolies
So these niggas walkin' around with the uzis
Strapped up, no camera, finisher the movie
Your life is a movie, get it? you stupid
Brother blind, colorblind, you're Doug Flutie
My girl is a newbie, a princess convinced she was sent here for me
Sent here to be, anyways I'ma rip this and eat any pussy MC
Say you are what you eat, ain't no pussy in me
Tell a nigga bye bye 'cause you pussies N-Sync
Don't squint nor blink, better talk 'fore you think
No, think 'fore you talk or the plank you can walk
Like a pirate, Spillville violence
Mushrooms molly, y'all niggas wildin'
Grown man fuck boy, y'all niggas childish
My dick is the bomb like Arabian Saudi
Yeah yeah shawty, you cannot afford it
Let me get back to my blunt and my forty
Para Tu shawty, what it do shawty?
This bitch choosin', who shawty? (who shawty?)
I gotta do what I gotta do and I gotta move how a nigga gotta move, too cool (too cool)
Got bitches like buku, got money like buku, red sip like soowoo
Your flow boo-boo, my shit too
I'm too cool man, shit, ahh, Para Tu

Everyone's a star
Every day's the move

For you, yeah
Everyone's a star
Every day's the move
Everywhere we are
For you[Intro]
Hasta luego, I'm finna break

[Verse 1]
All of my, all of my life
I been chasing a check and I never get it
Been around it, seen it, never had it
Mama, daddy, whole family, broke family
I'ma get it, told 'em I'll fuckin' handle it
And murder the game so the service candle lit
Emergency lane and I'm swerving, damaging the whip
But shit, fuck it, I'm fucking vanishing
Had to get out of Atlanta for a little minute
You know that there's madness in the fucking city
I thought it was love here
I thought I was good, I'm stuck in the mud here
I'm looking for drugs
I'm looking for big buds with the good hair
Or a ten-piece hot lemon pepper sprinkled
Fries crinkled, that's the lingo
If that's your girlfriend, she acting single
I caught the pass like I'm Ochocinco
I hit the gas down ocho cinco, like 85
It's like 8 or 9 'o clock, my nine cocked
If you on my guap, I won't stop 'til that boy go pop
They won't stop 'til they boy like Pac
They just pop 'til they brain fall out (Damn)
They never know what I be talking about
I only do it 'cause they never really talking about it
Bout it, bout it, turn the music louder, louder
How the fuck did anyone assume the God
The Son, the Son of God, the runnin' from the money
Bleed the blood just like the money, it's not Jumanji
I'm the doom that damned the dungeon
I'm the spoon that fed the hungry
Stand for something, fall for nothing, all or nothing
Y'all niggas balling, huh?
Just to find out that shit is all for nothing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I been going crazy, somebody pray for me
Take a second, take a knee
It'll mean everything, it'll mean everything to me

[Chorus]
I tell 'em to get out the way, I'm finna take it to 'em
Hasta luego, we finna make a move
Give me a break, what is you saying to 'em?
Give me the 'K, I'm finna spray the room
I'm finna spray the room (Shit, uh, okay)

[Verse 2]
Ok, everybody rich, everybody skraight, yeah, everybody ballin'
I never had shit, mind over matter, outside, I can't call it
All my niggas finna get a job, or they already got it
Couple trapping, couple catching bodies
Please don't come to East Atlanta, shawty
With your bullshit and your flex cap tryna' juug shit
Nah nigga, you'se a good lick, be a good guy, you a good kid
Never really understood this
But it's probably not for me to understand
I just played the cards I was fucking handed
And dealt with it like a fucking man
You my nigga then you my nigga then
Then we stick together like we Huck and Finn
We gon' get the chicken while we fucking hens
Don't let any nigga come fuck up the plan
If we gotta ride, well then, fuck it, then
If a nigga die, it got out of hand
If I touch the sky then my other guys
Recognize, must avenge
Jeopardize, I publicize, justified
When we busted in, were you terrified?
Was it televised when them rebel guys started busting heads
Over what a nigga said or do to J.I.D?
These the crazy niggas that I grew up with
In the shady city that I grew up in
They ain't doing shit but they doing shit

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hasta luego, I gotta get up away from here
Hoping that somebody pray for me
Telling you it'll mean everything
Everything you know what I mean
There's no working no emergency
I don't wanna be a burden, yeah
I just really hope you love a nigga when he's hurting

[Chorus]
I tell 'em get out the way, I'm finna take it to 'em
Hasta luego, we finna make a move
Give me a break, what is you saying to 'em
Give me the 'K, I'm finna spray the room
I'm finna spray the room[Verse 1]
As I looked at my watch and try to gather my thoughts
That was locked in a box, outside, the reflect of the clock
That was on my wall, aw dog, you been thinkin' a lot
Drinkin’ a lot of the lean and smokin' the pot
Heather swallowed my dick and called it her black cock
And said that she'll be back so don’t tax for the crack rock
And I'm like, "you could bet not," better get you some snapshots
In your mind of some type 'cause I'm a stand up type of guy
You'll be surprised what these bitches'll do
Keep my blunts rolled, pronto, even give me they soul
If you don't know then I know what you didn't befo’
Are you convinced that I’m the prince that told that y'ain’t know?
Sorry, didn't mean to fool ya, but yeah I'm the manure
Can I get a Hallelujah? Baby it's Michael Jr
Sorry, didn’t mean to fool ya, but baby I'm the manure
Can I get a Hallelujah? 'Cause bitch it's Michael Jr

Live mixtape, download it to a folder
Play it, delete it, shit was slowin' up my modem
Hop you quick enough to dodge the shots niggas throwin'
Head, shoulders, arm, back, stomach, scrotum
Oh, but we ain't done yet, we bustin' 'til the sunset
Let's get a little deeper, we ain't even havin' fun yet
L.E. said I'm humble as fuck and I could stunt
Be loud, smellin' myself, shit, I'll leave it to my blunt
Once I'm done with this flow, I'll leave it to a dust
Let 'em fuck it up, cocaine your nose with a uppercut
Fuck is up? Feelin' so anti-sober
In NY looking for leaf like a clover

Bang, bang, whoever thought you'd find
A iller group of niggas who was rollin' in the same gang
Been goin' balls to the walls, now it's time to let my nuts hang
And I'm still hustling, niggas still tryin' to jock the slang
And they bitch is lookin' for a cock to swing on
Go up and down, get they stock exchange on
The ride get rough so hang on, and I just do me
And I'm so Lati' I could fuck around and get my sang on
Ah Ahem, like
U-N-I-T-Y, and we all equal but if you and I was ever tied
Then I prob'ly wasn't doin' somethin' right
Like when I piss and hiccup at the same time
And then I hit your chick up like, "What you doin' tonight?"
And then she send me pictures of that ass, so that ass in disguise
You know she doin' the plank on the vine
Where you plank on the wood while the guy's in recline
I think it's called the ride to the sky
I ain't really sure, I just heard it was tight
Damn, what's with the evil eye?
I'm chill, no I'm not a evil guy
Not a fan of lettin' all that bullshit fly y'all jump on
I just like to lead, want to follow? Then come on
Y'all chose the same path, I found another to run on

Right, left, right, left, left, hop, dip, skip

I'm finna hit the zip lick for zip-lock bags so keep your lip zipped
Shit poppin' like ten zits, I got a little weed oil
Pull it when the pen lit, that's a good drag
He be high as fuck in a minute, and that's a good bag
I got it from my Cali plug and she's a dentist
Back in the book bag, I roll it, light it, no look pass
That's too gassy, sulfuric acid, girl you nasty

Still managing to come up with the magic in the true fashion

You so fine, I'd try and do some molly off your bu-, heheheh

My cup runneth over, theirs ain't full enough
They bad but that ain't good enough
They mad 'cause they ain't half of what I'm cookin' up
Taraji out in line, giving cookies up
Plug in my supply, need a jumper cable, why?
Gon' hook me up, the devil is a lie (Lie)
Who won't shush me up, I heard he got that fire
Gon' kush me up, I'm gone
Push me up, mister how high, that I can kiss the sky
Gon' look me up
She pushing up her bra, like cookies looking kushy in the jar
Told her book me, hit the nookie up tomorrow
See police be tryna book me 'cause they put me in Segal
You's a rookie, I'ma boogie 'fore you put me in the car
I got beef with my connect, I'm vexed
'Cause you see his THC is not correct, I think he should not collect
Not upset, I ain't trippin', what, he pitchin' out his best
Should be glad my hand is gripped around his spliff and not his neck, yes
This not a bogie, you already know the smell
Not that codeine, I heard that lean is deadly for your health
If you know me, then know that I already got some L's
Of some OG, so you can smoke that Reggie by yourself

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Ha, I'm trapped in my mind, I need help (I need help)
I sit back and recline, and inhale (And inhale)
Bitch I'm back on my grind, you can't tell
When I hit the spliff, only time we face L's

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Eenie miney moe, I pick a flow and set sail
J.I.D and Joey, they say we the best out
They studying the methods, tell them, "Class in sesh now"
I'm a walking legend walking with my chest out
Please babe don't you push me 'cause I'm off the edge, dawg
My sonics got me politicin' with them hedgehogs
You hooked up on my findings, I'm hooked on this chemdawg
I smoke on the regular, you smokin' that Reginald
Look y'all ain't ready for this, I'm back spasmin'
Chain too heavy, it's giving me back spasm
Pardon the sarcasm, inside it's all pessim'
I rides the beat until it have a bargasm
Pregnant pause, bitch I might shoot the club up
I'm way too raw, I'm going in without a rubber
I'm smokin' on this fire batch, it got me raisin' hell
While I hold this Mac-11 screaming, "Fuck twelve"

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
I'm trapped in my mind, I need help (I need help)
I sit back and recline, and inhale (And inhale)
Bitch I'm back on my grind, you can't tell (You can't tell)
When I hit the spliff, only time we face L's (Face L's)
I'm trapped in my mind, I need help
I sit back and recline, and inhale
Bitch I'm back on my grind, you can't tell
When I hit the spliff, only time we face L's

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Ride out
That's what you call generations, and generation now
Know that, J.I.D[Interlude: Leslie Wright]
I'll be your fantasy
Loud when you want it, quiet when you need it
And screaming if you really need it
Put the record on repeat and I'll say your name
Over and over and over and over again
My name is music
I love the attention, but am I getting played?
Your body moves to the things that I do
Entranced by the voodoo of my voice
And yet I can't help but wonder
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)[Skit]
Evil
Evil
Evil
Baby, evil
(What'd you say)
Baby! (Huh?)
Evil (I can't hear you)
Baby, baby, Route you know you hear me talkin' to you
Baby (Heyyy, damn)

Yah[Intro]
Alright
Heard this shit like one time before, this beat
Check, uh, look, get it

[Verse 1]
Split it with my niggas 'cause what's mines is ours
Only way you multiply if you divide the power
Grind for hours, fronto, pine-i sour
Why the fuck you think this nigga Cole was high for hours?
Why the fuck you think they got me out the slums of Atlanta?
'Cause J.I.D a computer, boy, I come with the data
Cool, keeping my balance, stumbled over a carcass
Smooth drink from a chalice, let me cook, I'm an artist
You can never see me, I b-ring the noise
Fuck your haha's and hehe's, you see, we deploy
Couldn't read me if he W.E.B Du Bois
Nigga cease-cease your voice 'fore we lea-leak your boy
Peep me, J.I.D be on your TV, my girl skee wee
My weed kiwi, my dreads tipi, my oil tea tree
Wake the game up, them boys sleepy
A rose grew from concrete, soil, and feces
Hear me clear 'cause I don't really like to repeat it
Your favorite rapper gets ctrl-alt-deleted
He sees it, she sees it, nigga, we seize the moment
Please show me my opponent, motherfucker
My dad gave me the swag, God gave me the voice
I said you niggas play it like we gave you a choice
Just watch how the game play, don't play with them boys
They breath stankin', hand shaking and moist
Must avoid, gun blast such a joyful noise
Pick your poison, pick your squad of boys and vandalize some stores
Five, four, trey, deuce, one, Jesus son
Make nuisance or shake loose 'cause you can die from a gun
Gay guys do drive-bys—that's a fruit roll up
And I ain't homophobic, look, my gun will blow her
Tryna turn my city to the modern Sodom and Gomorrah
They sneak dissing but they will not take a shot at the boy, yuh
Never Oscar de la Hoya, I'm like Ali with it
I got this 3-57, I got this weed with me
And it's crazy because I'm up in NYC with it
Won't catch me with it, Plaxico Beezy, shit
I ain't Lil Weezy, but that nigga inspired my dreams
So word to him, Jay, Nas, 'Ye, Kenny, and D
But watch this guillotine flow, slice the head of her king
Kings cool, kamikaze, J.I.D step on the scene
Just like somebody has awoken a kraken out the cave
Crack in a box, and I lock in intemperate rage
I was down in my socks and intoxicated in the rain
'Cause my rhymes wasn't getting to the people from the page
I took my piggy bank, came back to the A with a felony charge
Penning if I don't pay the state
Pendulum swing, swang, swung, knocked me across my face
Realizations of not becoming anything
Kinda funny 'cause it's like a fucking dungeon in my brain
Put a noose around my neck, let that bungeecord hang
Call upon the Lord mane, I need run support
Or a magic wand, maybe Dumbledore
To help me out, then get me out this damn revolving door
The hell we 'bout to do I'm 'bout to just jump out the porch
I know I'm bound to make it, boy, I'm the cow manure
Megatron with the puns, I'm like the Calvin boy
Saddle the cattle niggas down for the battle, it ends one or two ways in the ground or the gavel
Gravel under my toes, thinking the time I’ve done traveled
Mind over matter, not with the chatter, you running my data blocka the block up
Niggas act up, and act as if the reaction to happenings hella tragic
But it's part of the pattern
Paddy cake in her face and she freebasing and scraping it off the plate
On that white, 'cause that green being tested by the state
On this mic so I formulate the method every day
What you like, what you wanna hear, I show you how it's made
On this Hen straight, fuck a beer, see a slim waist and her friend
I could probably cover two like a buccaneer

[Interlude]
Haha, oh shit, aight that's all I got on that one
Let's do it
Oh yeah I can run with that, this my dawg
Run that back, run it back, run it back, let me get it from top
This my shit, this my shit, this my shit right here
Aight I got you, whatever
Uh, aight, where we gonna go with this one
Um, check, this my Big shit, word to B.I.G
Check, um, alright

[Verse 2]
Habeas corpus, how to produce a fuckin' body on the spot
Never not being ready for whatever
I had to fight with the Devil himself
He was upset that God's a woman
Never let him fuck, so he was mad in hell
The irony mad as hell 'cause you weak
Thinking 'bout these niggas in the rap game, boy, you weak
I won't speak unless a nigga speak to me
But I think, I'm on a brink of a—it's like, eureka! Eureka! I got it
Coming for your spot with head shots and red dots
Had my sister beat your lady into some red bottom
The flow like Alzheimer's; spit it, forget it, but he quick with it
All the time, God is good, all the time
Jiddy got all the rhymes, all the rhythms
I grab pens, calculate flows, algorithms
Arithmetic, a mathematician
The rhythm could kick the sound to kill 'em
But I don't even need the hassle
I just need the keys to the castle and some weed
Tell the judge you won't need my pee, like pterodactyl
I don't feel these niggas
Down south, Georgia boy watchin' Troy, I'mma kill these niggas
J.I.D snap like achilles tendons; you need to stretch more
Niggas tried to kick it to me, I'm Devin Hester
With the Russian chopper I got from my homegirl, Svetla
Get in the booth and niggas sweatin'
It's a sweatlodge when J.I.D in the room
You better come with all your methods, insidious moves
We taking flight when it's dark at night
Big gun with the sharpest knife, Hill Harper height
Glocks in Toy Story, J.I.D like a Gorgonite
Poltergeist, chill up your spine when it's cold at night
Pour quatro in the coldest sprite
Then bite down, Denzel with the overbite
Me and your lady on a motorbike
She facing me so I can motorboat her titties after this next right
Usually I'm blowing weed like Curren$y and Jet Life
Niggas aiming at dome, so keep your vest tight
I'm just trying get my steps right flow is a bloody mess
I was blessed with treasure inside the trash
Sever my hands reaching through the metal and glass
It's been a blast, feeling magic and in the madness, give me your hands
Give me passion, anything that could equal some satisfaction
Looking for love at the end of this Hen bottle
Looking for pub', let me pen your next album
Call from above, tell me J.I.D you been allowed to point it
Remerged, kicking lyrics in the South, no issue
Wipe that drizzle of your mouth, it's time to wake up the house
Y'all niggas been playing Skins vs. Blouses
I'mma keep my shirt on until some hoes come out
Always keep your word, homie, I don't know nothing else
I'm your father, go get a switch or a belt
Interrupting my method, in here making this velvet
Grab my dick and do a thrust with my pelvis
My shoes suede, but don't fuck with no Elvis
I'm from the era of real shit; kill-or-be-killed shit
Killer bee; real quick, float like butterfly
Sting like killer bee, flow worth kilograms, you niggas killin’ me
Thinkin’ you ill as me—what's shit to a enema?
Enemy, anyone, get at me, I'm the epitome

[Outro]
Hold on, man
Yeah, yo[Intro: DJ Drama]
Just the other day it was a just dream to make it
Just the other day, that same dream, they tried to take it
Just the other day all you wanna do is see 'em be great
Just the other day, they look you in your face, eyes full of hate
Bobby Kritical

[Chorus]
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (Woah, woah) nigga you too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros
(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
Just the other day I was, yeah

[Verse 1]
Just other day I was broke as a bitch
Walking to work in the hot sun, so-soaking it in
I never been a dope man, but I'm the dopest of man
Buying some smoke from the dude with the dope
Throw five, four point five, so on, so forth
I'm tryna get my fucking goals, not Goyard
Paying for the lawyers, get my bros out the courtyard
Cause I got the ear for the flows, not Mozart, but damn a nigga go hard
Put me on a postcard or miss me 'til the show start
My niggas got a Benz and he push it like a go-cart
Tryna get one of them, but my ends like "don't start
The bullshit again fore' you end up a broke boi again"
So don't pretend
Oh we remember, last September, like the coldest winter
Man I really had to show these niggas
I owe these niggas a throat slit, know me nigga

[Chorus]
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (Woah, woah) nigga you too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros
(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
Just the other day I was, yeah

[Verse 2]
Today, today, I woke up like this
My girl on my left, no watch on my wrist
Some rings on my fist, what we did last night?
Was it a hurricane in here last night?
It would appear that something sexual or severe
Happened being that I see liquor and beer
Weed, people still in the living room sleep, come and see, huh
She say "I'm dizzy," don't wanna move, just wanna lay under me
Honestly, I know that just other day you was goddamn broke
Watch outside, that nigga shot them folks
Glock in ya ride, you gotta watch them folks
And the cops be wilding, we ain't even provoke 'em
I remember being broker than I is right now
Tryna find a place to live, shit I'm is right now
In doubt of my next move, get a pill, bite down, find focus
I grab pen, it was poetry in motion
Not the same for many folks, different strokes
Colloquialism, idiot vision, y'all seen I was doing the most
Definite dope, it's on the scene, not in need of a vote
Repping the city, what's ya team, nigga? Fuck 'em
East Atlanta king and I mean every letter
But when I'm good, I'm good, when I'm bad, I'm better
The man of the method, it's a method to the madness
I'm stepping in my bag with the cannon, step back
Repping the city, showing love that I don't ever get back
But that's the plight of a player, plot an attack and rocking and rapping
Rippin' rappers off of the fuckin' map, suckers suffering, succotash
I need that Mark Zucker bag, Zuckerberg
Hovercraft flows, I don't fuck with that, bullshit below
From the ceiling to the floor, full schizo for the dough
New pistol, but I know I'm planting seeds so they can grow
But if they don't, then I don't know
But all I know a nigga

[Chorus]
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (Woah, woah) nigga you too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros
(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
Just the other day I was, yeah[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Verse 1]
Get my girl angry and pissed and give that pussy a kiss
Pushing the same piece of shit until I get me a Bentley
Same niggas, same goals, same dreams and epiphanies
Me and my niggas are same lines as symmetry, wasn't empathy
Remember we would front yard brawl with big Timothy?
Kicked them doors because we had a lot of energy
My brother was locked up for shooting at the enemy
Caught one nigga then caught fifteen
I ain't meet that nigga 'til I was fifteen
Now I'm kicking 16's with a big screen in attempt to get the big cream
Little guy with a big dream, I need guidance
'Cause if I don't succeed, I probably proceed violence
Sippin' on the brown, no Bobby, I don't fuck with nobody
No team and no posse, you can catch it like Shockey
King of all kings, praise Haile Selassie
Rastafari, I don't need nobody, the God's got me

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Interlude]
You ain't used to the hustle, bro
Yeah, that shit how you live
We on a trade for a trade
I do this for you, I do this for you, you know what I mean?
I took the risk, you took the risk, I ain't disrespect it

[Verse 2]
So part of the reason I be so hard on my people
We never had it easy, never had a pot to pee in
I be on my knees praying till my onomatopoeia's packing a coliseum
Ain't no parking, I gotta see J.I.D
Gotta be there for my family, I gotta, can't try to be
I could be out of my mind, thinking logically
No apologies for speaking how I feel, I silently swore solemnly
That I would be the guy to make my black people proud of me
Roses to the mothers of anybody that doubted me
Yo' chick want dick, bitch dove in the covers
Overseen my areas, surveyed over my brothers
You touch them, you kill me, you can't get close to none of us
They still double-dribble, we going for triple-doubles
Triple up on your investment fuckin' with us
Probably have to rock that vest shit, you fuckin' with us
Wait (Nah bro) Huh? (What you talkin' 'bout, homes?)

[Chorus]
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth

[Verse 3]
Okay but fuck that shit, I gotta get it, I gotta get 'em
Tired of picking these locks, you don't respect my existence
I used to sleep in my car, never a park or a bench
But damn a nigga was broke, damnit if I didn't get it
Them niggas was thinking that it was just some rap for the kid
One day they gon' hit my phone, hit the show, scream, clap for the kid
Let's get it poppin', they're pulling pistols on apostle Paul
So pay the piper or meet the sniper, legend of the fall
I knew in diapers you and I was nothing alike at all
I do or die, you do it to die, I'm really making calls
You couldn't kill it and take it out of me, the ideology
This the odyssey, I'm Odysseus, you gotta follow me
Watch how I maneuver, I influence the influencers
The flow is like the flu in influenza going through the motion
So I motivate all of my niggas, they tell me kill 'em with kindness
I'd rather kill 'em and their other significants
Writing lyrics in the city with pretty booties and titties
Don't get the cooties, it ain't like the movies
It kinda is 'cause they're shooting, kind of shit is you moving?
Shit I'm pushing, empower the people life where I grew up
Someone tutored the students, these niggas stupidest, stupider, stupid shit
Sick as a bitch, flick of the wrist, my pen cleanse  my many sins
The irony the iron can't straighten out any wrinkle in existence
Ripple in time triple my eyes realistically sick in the mind
Sick in the head?
Wish I was dead, sick on a med, addicted
My lead sick 'em, give 'em, send 'em to hell, eh

[Outro]
Okay, okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a—
Okay, I told motherfuckers I—
Bitch[Intro]
This is beautiful
What is that, velvet?

[Verse 1]
Pardon me, but this shit might come out a little retarded
But I have to put my heart in it, give the orderlies orders
Here's an organ
According to the wall these niggas started, I have to go abortion
Killing niggas and broads like, Tam, Tammy, and even little Toya
Put a baby crib in front of my fort tourist and fucking floor it
Might as well cause these bitches is dumb as hell
Having a baby with males and raising them by themselves
These niggas is all in jail, the streets are on some tweet shit
Kicking up they feeds, kids got nothing to eat shit
These bitches is on some street shit and I ain’t cheat bitch
But if you think I'm tricking then Ctrl, Alt, Delete bitch
Get up off the seat, snap, snap
Cause you gotta show me something other than pretty face and features
And it would be cool to say I drop bars for features
But nah, I been kicking dope shit since a fetus
Na I don't need your rap bars on my remix
Turn Soulja Boy tell ’em into Soulja Boy teethless
Ask about the kid, J.I.D, older boys preaching
Teaching the opposite of squealing

[Break]
East Atlanta breath
And my breath is never stink
I just smoked a blunt, high as hell

[Verse 2]
And If every you was to act foolish
One call, that's all, nigga, [?]
I ain't saying I'm goonin, but I been through it
And them two, plus you, equals three stooges
You got the mind, nigga use it
Got two strikes, finna be your third time losing
You fucking stupid, I'm cooling
Blowing some earth, wind, and fire
I use my Bic to ignite it
Where I'm from niggas glorify the rims and the tires and then recycle the swag along with cans and bags
Everybody goes green if not that, then beans or Xans, codeine, lean
Some doing the Charle Sheen
And the boys come and take them away like Charline from Aunt Chamberlain
Scrambling for Benjamins and everything equivalent
Sending M&Ms and chilling with women friends who's friend's friend resemble them
Hundred grand, all tens

[Outro]
You already know what it is
Oh these boys got us too flexed up[Verse 1: Jace]
Krispy or Kreme, whip me a beam
Double cup a couple blunts and sip me some wait

Krispy or Kreme, whip me a beam
Double cup a couple blunts and sip me some lean
Pockets on Shrek though, crazy big green
Crazy big steam coming out that limousine
I’m one with my chakras, my partners is mean
I’ve got to intrigue the thots in my league
Get the only motherfucker with like three chains on
In a free range range with like three gay broads
Who are all interested in a three way off
Doing a bunch of drugs with a grade A star
I am crazy hard and a lazy fart
Kinda way, runaway
Who say Jace ain’t hard?
No, they can’t shake my squad
All I pray is pussy niggas learn to play they part

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Okay the lights keep flicking, I’mma stand in the dark
I need a cup of that brown shit and some weed from the heart
So show me love lil nigga, I been fuckin’ with y’all
Ghost whispers, she wan’ be my mistress
But I ain’t got no time, no time, no time, no more
I said I was on my Joe Pa
My hands still numb from the winter
Into the door where the mula
You niggas been holding out into the door where the shooter
Ain’t nobody fucking moving
Just want my words to touch like I’m reading in braille
The little engine that could can’t get derailed
If he tails talks
Touch we meeting later for brunch
To discuss how I’m losing my muchness, pretty much
I’m done with you silly fucks, need work, you finna Phillipe
Shit, he made Jiddy have to center his inner Ye
See me, I’m king with a capital K
And you niggas is all G’s with a capital gay
And I’m gonna go scoop my girl the capital state
We gon’ take it somewhere foreign, blunts bud Bjorn
I’ll probably put a hole in the stage when we start touring
Tearing up cos we toured up
Nigga do the Roosevelt
Drinking champagne make my stomach belt
My girl so juicy it’s like Welch's
Tell me you’re a virgin I’m so selfish
And tell me how you fucked 2Pac with no Elvis
Love lobster but hate shellfish
High girl but you so celcius
That’s why I met a thousand you’s and a thousand crews
Probably fucked a thousand dudes
Me and Venus, that’s a thousand 2
Blood walk on the moon and pay a thousand dues
Thousand dollars to my name nigga, ouch
Just coming from off the couch with a blunt in my mouth
Stick my head out the door of the house
Heard something ‘bout you running the south[Verse 1]
Wait...alright
Sorry I don’t give a fuck about no college shit
They couldn’t keep me in that bitch with a scholarship
I would've been the Dali Lama or like Don Lemon
But I'm Dicaprio, digging my inner Bart Simpson
The bitch fine
I’m breath smelling and toe sniffing
I just look at you like you art
I cry books of garth
I know that she prolly leave
And break my achy breaky heart
But I don’t care cause I don’t need that organ
Probably find that shit again when I have me a daughter
But with my karma I probably have forty four of them
One son
Little one son
Japanese mom
Beyonce
But if you jump dumb
I turn your ass to Willy Lump Lump
Left silly slumped
Rap game, Willy Wonka
Need a ticket or a sponsor
I'm just coming through your monitors
Sitting in your kitchen
While your momma in her pajamas
Making eggs for your brother and your father
Go to school now
Gym locker room
Little buddy got the tool
We ain’t telling, shit's cool till he busting at you
I was just thinking I could die or get some dust on my shoes
From running, but these my favs
I should walk the other way
See, me and God had a long talk the other day
He just told me some jokes
And told me I can lead the way
Told me I could make the change
But, thats all I gotta say

[Chorus]
Been a long day
Smoke until my head hurt
Running all the way
Putting in the leg work
Rolling up the paper
Take a shot of Jager
Shawty wan me swam in the pussy like a sailor
Shorty from Chicago
She love O Block
Hop out the car smoking out the whole block
Tryna pull me over
We don’t fuck with no cops
We don't stop
We don't fuck with roadblocks

[Interlude: Sample]
Could you not talk with your mouth full?
Excuse me?
You're making me sick, I'm gonna throw up
Oh, okay, Dad
Sure thing, Dad

[Verse 2]
Baby got the ass like SZA
Long ass hair
Wanna beat like the RZA
She just want joke like the Riddler
But if I puzzle this little picture
She probably end up with dick near her appendix
Ooh splendid
Now I gotta buy her shiny shit
Dyslexic she tryna do the 96
Wanna come to a G spot bitch
Find this shit
Tryna tell me you the bomb
Like I don't mine and shit
I been all across the world
On my grind and shit
Sticky bud in my grinder
Can't grind this shit
Suck a dick on your Insta and Vine
But its words you want
And I promise I ain't got a dime
Look at God while you crying
I ain't dying for a record to sell
Beef not getting the money
So it's selfish as hell to the squad
Anyways, if I was there I never could fail
Cause JID major childish, Petty Labelle
Sqeaky voice, but the flow hold steady as hell
My wordplay wordly and I ate the gazelle
The other day and the girl, her name was Giselle
It was easy as hell, she was a jezebel
Yeah, uh
I go an split a short with my shorty
Little tired, she been riding, Kentucky Derby
Little God bless this strong and hold it sturdy
Hold that shit down I don't wanna catch a murdy
Ovua, merci
I never been in a Testarossa
But I throw this dick like Testaverde
All of them heard me
JID so nouny and verby
Talking about pussy pounding and slurping
Wait...

[Chorus]
Been a long day
Smoke until my head hurt
Running all the way
Putting in the leg work
Rolling up the paper
Take a shot of Jager
Shawty wan me swam in the pussy like a sailor
Shorty from Chicago
She love O Block
Hop out the car smoking out the whole block
Tryna pull me over
We don’t fuck with no cops
We don't stop
We don't fuck with roadblocks, x 4[Intro]
Can you say that again?
Just the way you said it, just the same way
This shit kinda special right now
I don’t know what you’re talking about
No..c’mon you know what I’m talking about
If I’m not mistaken, you just tried to bribe a federal officer
No technically I didn’t bribe anybody
No, no that's not the conversation I heard

[Verse 1]
I got weed on my head, but don’t call me a weed head
Fleas in my bed, but don’t say I’m a dog
Them niggas thought we were cool because they saw me with y’all
I’m sorry that you’re confused, but they aren’t arguing dog
They tried to shit on “jed”, I just use it as fertilizer
I came from a twig, from seeds to burglarizer
Am high as a bitch, I got women to circumcise you
Circulatory service, service to sanitize you

[Verse 2]
I got cheese on my head, but don’t call me a cheese head
I’m packing like a packer,when it comes to cheese bread
I said I need money, I got to keep that bread close
Bread dough, hopefully I can eat a day’s loaf
My bitches love me, I know so,  because they say so
Broke nigga they got no job and shit paid for
Except for the ride that nigga “jig” got the age flow
Secrets of bitch, but then again they get paid for
There need to be an exact dollar figure for the exchange services that would not hold up to court of law
No No
I heard it that's the truth
I want to tell you this
Sail on boat fit for a bond villain
Sometimes you need to play the part right?[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Savage, hard-head living, huh
Devil on my shoulder, I can't see him, I just feel him, huh
God is my witness, focus vision, keep a distance, huh
Dream motion living, being broke got me livid, huh
Bitches after bitches, huh, all my niggas 2Pac
Speaking revolution or that shit that might get you shot, huh
Threatened like I'm Biggie, huh
Kicking like I'm Ong Bak
Bitches love Jid 'cause I got three legs and two socks

[Hook: Curtis Williams]
I smoke more than I eat
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?
I smoke more than I eat
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?
I smoke more than I eat
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?
I smoke more than I eat
(you so crazy, you so crazy, you so crazy)
Drink more than I sleep
I fuck more than I love girl, so wassup?
Is you freaky?

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Savages, let's get back to business
I was bumping Webbie, webbing through what's in his vision
Realize the image, was nothing like myself
Became something different, I ain't nothing like no one else
Funny I would say that, sorry that you didn't
Sorry woman, sorry nigga, I feel sorry for your kiddies
I can't keep it artificial
I official, all the whistles
I won't even argue with you
I'm so high, it's all medicinal
Imma get you high
Pull up on a lones and it get you shot
Talk a little shit brrr pop pop
Still called your nigga like Jid Joe Pa, but is Jid Joe Pa
Yeah no naw
I just fuck, I hit no raw
Them talk slick, I twist your jaw
No boys on leash don't tempt no dog
All I gotta do is let 'em off the wrist though
10 4 niggas shooting from the hip so
Shut eye I can shoot 'em from a disco
Niggas shooting on the blitz tho
Touchdown, had to throw the ball to Christo
Nigga had to get ghost
Me talking shit, broke, pissed and paranoid I'm grabbing on my pistol
My bull in a dismal state for dismissal I dipped my dick in gold girl who sent you?
Tell my dick don't get too hard, we out in public being stars
I would just take you to my whip
Fucked a bitch, flipped a car
Ridin slab, sipping bar
I heard it from a G before, I always knew I'd be a star
Had to talk, me and God
Told me there was two types of people, me and yall
Sorry I ain't seeing y'all, it's gonna take like 33 of y'all
45s at 4-5 am, no I ain't sleep at all
Ask me why I go so hard
Ask me why I flow so hard
I ain't tripping, I just ask them niggas what team they going for[Intro: Sample]
I'm honored to be here today. I stand before you not as an expert, but as a concerned citizen. This is the most urgent of times and the most urgent of messages. The community knows it, industry knows it, governments know it, even the United States military knows it. You can make history, or you will be vilified by it

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
While they were sittin' on they hands, I was standin' and plottin'
When I be in my own world, It's like the world has forgotten
Meditatin' in silence besides the loud in my pocket
I don't want to hear nothing, a rat pissin' on cotton
A rapper pissin' on rappers, I'm a Jekyll, I'm a jackal
From rapper to rapper, you rappers PaRappa the Rapper
Shark in the lake, dodgin' the fake
On the line, I'm a snapper
Heard you the best thing coming up, oh, God, I'm dyin' from laughter
No, I'm dyin' from living
I been robbing and giving
Niggas chances just to raise the fucking standards, wait
Heard all the hoopla, faking, and all the antics
Can't even count all the punches a nigga landed
Nationwide tour from the west side, then back to Decatur
I ain't even signed this deal, girl, I'm just splashing this swavor
Baby, you Betty Shabazz, you kinda match my flavor
I'm a freak with a great mind, girl, a master debater
Hornier than the good Reverend Dr. Martin Luther
Come here, baby, come and kiss on the king junior
Then take a trip to the six, with me, it ain't pretty as Toronto, Canada
Gotta walk with the hammer here
Small things like that you couldn't fathom
Little forty'll knock the apple out of Adam
Little shorty sling weed and crack dabble
Upgrade to full-time, where your tassle, where your bando?
Where the hassle when the cops jocking, blocking trying to find?
Where the guala and the drugs? Ollie oxen free
Hotbox topping foxy mama in a box chevy, monotonous debauchery
Obviously I've been out of it awhile
You should've got my things and sent for me
Empathy, empathize with my pathological lies
Divide that pride and split the pot
It's only by God's grace that I made it this far
Thus far, I need his plus y'alls

[Interlude: Leonardo DiCaprio]
Every week, we’re seeing new and undeniable events, evidence that accelerated climate change is here now. Droughts are intensifying, our oceans are acidifying, with methane plumes rising up from beneath the ocean floor. We are seeing extreme weather events, and the West Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets melting at unprecedented rates, decades ahead of scientific projections

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Waiting on shit to pan out, why you standing there with your hand out like you looking for some change?
I mean, I could offer that, but why would I offer that when you niggas could just utilize your brain?
I want that right there, yeah, I want that right there, yeah, give me all that there
Yeah, want that right there, so, come on 'bout that there, I need all that there

[Outro: Shelly Nicole]
We need it all, like
Some niggas like, how he get on, how he get on?
He get on because he's supposed to be
You gotta work for this shit
Niggas got great time, great time, great hustle
This is the time, no more weak shit
It's not allowed like, new rules, we on some new shit
Well, it's the same shit, but we gon' teach y'all some new rules
Cause niggas make the same shit
This right here, it's gon' get you right
This is the motivation that you need
Take notes, take notes
Don't copy cause you can't, but you can take some notes          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        [Verse 1: J.I.D.]
Y'all niggas lookin' like money; ching-ching
Light shine, starin' at your wrist; bling-bling
Lightweight J.I.D., get drunk off a Yuengling
Let that thing sing, sing, sing, send him to Sing Sing
But I ain't got time for no jail time, no
Pick them shells up, let 'em cool down, blow
Pull up to your big ass crib like ("Hello?")
Nobody here? Y'all ready to go?
I got division like Mansa Musa
Can fuck your bitch like a barracuda
Uzi tooly Boolie, who the shooter?
Yeah, it's not mine, cause I forgot the ruger
Never been a gangster, I'm riding with my seatbelt on, tryna drive and roll up all of this weed in my palms

[Verse 2: J.I.D.]
Twenty-five to life, it all started with a coca leaf
I swear I been the dopest this not how its supposed to be
Niggas spent the bend and shot at everybody close to me
And they killed my nigga T, dome shot, R.I.P
Niggas killing niggas I ain't even get the notion
They out here catching bodies and a nigga ain't provoke em
Oh shit, guess I need to pick me up a strap now
Nowadays, niggas don't even know how to act (Bow)
Run to the hills to avoid the high waters
They flooded the crops, kill pops, they tryn done us
They Marshawn Lynch with the Glock, they ran rumpus
Dunk us, Jordan signs seen clear when they stomp us
Sick of Atlanta, I hit my girl, then flew to Dulles
Bumping Dwele, dwelling on the past they ain't tell us about
All we do is accept they bullshit they sell us

[Outro: Key!]
Okay!
Niggas ain't talking how they living
(Mumbling, repetitive 'For real!' 'Okay!')

[Outro: Leonardo DiCaprio and Interviewer]
*Do feel or do you think that it's a human nature that we always want more?*
I think it's not just in human nature I think it's a characteristic of all life, I think opportunism and greed has really been the key to you know, survival
*Can you relate to that, always wanting more?*
Well, the truth is, it's you know, we all have good and bad in us and that, you know, you have to stop yourself, you have to stop yourself. You know and ultimately create a balance and think about others
I think everyone can get into that addiction I mean it's an easy trap to get into, you know, on a personal level uh, you know I think that you find people like this and I've met a lot of people like this who's entire world is consumed by wealth. And and you meet them and you talk to them and you realize they dont have a lot of foundation in their life whatsoever
And so therefore this becomes the root of all hapiness for them. And of course I like money like everybody else, that would be an absolute lie, but I think its important to be responsible at the same time. And I also think it's important to give back to if your in a privilaged position. I think that that should be  a pre-requisite to anyone who's gotten to accumulate a lot of welath in their life
I think that it should be standard

For real
For real
For real
Okay[Intro]
"You gotta work for greatness, man, you gotta work
You gotta work hard just to be good
Fuck being great, so imagine greatness, we gon' be great."

[Intro: Johnny Venus]
I told that bitch to get with me cause I'll be 21 forever
Skippin' cross the globe, baby girl, what the fuck is bad weather?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He jumped up out the hood, what, you thought he ain't wan' go?
I told the motherland I'll be back, you ain't know?

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
Skate, open the drapes
Silhouette, not a face approaches
With a plate full of crepes, grapes with the blunt to chase
Teeth paste, lay waste, lay pipe
Say grace, regular George would say that's dynamite
JJ damn kids, Bebe, damn J.I.D
Ate the whole state, put the straw in the great lakes
Fuck these steaks, tryna get overseas
Talking shit over trees, bumping Maurice king's treason
Thieves in the night if you readin' it right
We breed kings and knights, I'm still peepin' the sights, huh
Flabbergasted over the lights
Seen these niggas swagger jackin' over the night
That old shit you keep, but this time won't be nice
You hit me one time, second time gon' be like
The worst death since Michael, shots say Columbine
Shoppin' at boutiques in Niece, I gotta find
The dopest unique that speaks what's on my mind
Feelin' like I left my cleats, I gotta climb in 'em blind
Please show me how to get to, or maybe where to find, oh gladly
My London gal call me her American daddy
Reflex, no gaggy
She fuck with the mind, the tattoos and the swaggy
I gladly give her the whole bone like Lassie
But if she fuck another fella, she dead like Old Yeller
She deader than Helen Keller
I kill her, I really kill her
I'm chillin', I'm really feelin' myself and I'm really spillin'
I'm spillin' the whole cup, tell me, have you rolled up?
J.I.D got the alligator grip on your whole butt
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
Let me, let me hold up
No, bruh, I'm ready to get this money
I need more with these White girls who snort lines like they don't need noses
Spill' Ville billboard's posters
Need notice, notification of bosses
Like Meyer Lansky, you fancy pants fans can't stand me
J-I-D, baby, in the eyes for eye candy
Y'all don't understand me
This is for my niggas who say "Fuck understanding"
Standing under rain with my toes in the sand
Lightning playin', this shit sound like Coltrane
You gotta snatch this mic from my cold dead hands
And probably still have to fight the old dead man

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
I told that bitch to get with me cause I'll be 21 forever
Skippin' cross the globe, baby girl, what the fuck is bad weather?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He jumped up out the hood, what, you thought he ain't wan' go?
I told the motherland I'll be back, you ain't know?
Now usually I don't do this
Usually, I be tucked off in the corner looking foolish
Have everybody saying "Man, who, who, who, who this?"
Tryna' stick to myself like some praying hands
Or some crashed aliens
And I dance it like Zendaya dance
Woo, holy ghost don' got me shiverin'
Tilted with the top with just a little off his rocker
He tryna paint his life, his future brighter than his father's
Crazy, how could they start him?
JFK with the pardon
Listen, I play it often, it whistles on through the dark
See, we be def starring your clan, missing the mark
I be waiting on ya early like I'm 'posed to play the organ

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
Cleaner than a rubber duck, what the fuck?
Mommy suck, daddy yelled "Please, oh, please! Please, oh please!"
So we can find it, and it's hard to stay with us
We just bleed, we just bleed out the eyeball radius
The crimson tears of growing up
I'm super lifted off that Eucalyptus
Watching all my foolish visions come into fruition
While you losin' business, you stupid nigga
Them copy-cat maneuvers ain’t conducive to your movement, nigga
Eating cooch for dinner while she do the dishes
Direct a choir in my sex attire
Look at your neighbor, tell your neighbor "Pull her dress up higher"
Just like Elijah when I profit, ain't no bush on fire
Still ain't believing what he's leaving [?]
Is he a 5 percenter? Kinda hard to Identify when he’s high, spittin' and his eyes flicker
Then the sky opened up and that lightning hit him
I'm like "Damn, I might actually sound alright on this one"
We camping realer than a jungle in the night on this one
And I’m just chillin', imagine me off of my prescriptions
Bring your camera, your brain might deny your business
Said bring your camera, your brain might deny your visions
Spillage Village! I have no life

[Outro: J.I.D]

Fam, take me to where the bars is at
Take me to the street where the bars is at
J.I.D, DJ Drama, let's get it

[Chorus]
Okay, I'm mounted up (Huh)
High off the ground, watch me count it up
Cop me a pound, burn it down with us (Uh)
Let's hit the town, is you down or nah?
Look at me now, I done found me some

[Verse 1]
Treasure inside the trash
Sever my hands reaching through the metal and glass
It's been a blast, feel the magic in the madness, give me yo' hands
Give me passion, anything that can equal some satisfaction
Looking for love at the end of this Henn' bottle
Looking for pub', let me pen your next album
Call from above, tell me kid you been allowed to
Point it to re-emerge, kicking lyrics in the South, no issue
Wipe that drizzle off your mouth, it's time to wake up the house
Y'all niggas been playing skins versus blouses
I'mma keep my shirt on until some hoes come out
Always keep your word, homie, I don't know nothing else
I'm your father, go get a switch or a belt
Interrupting my method, in here making this velvet
Grab my dick and do a thrust with my pelvis
My shoes suede but don't fuck with no Elvis
I'm from the era of real shit, kill-or-be-killed shit
Kill-or-be real quick, float like butterfly
Sting like killer bee, flow worth kilograms
You niggas killin' me thinkin’ you ill as me
What's shit to an enema, enemy?
Anyone, get at me, I'm the epitome

[Chorus]
Fuck, hey, I'm mounted up (Huh)
High off the ground, watch me count it up (Look)
Cop me a pound, burn it down with us (Uh)
Let's hit the town, is you down or nah? (Yeah)
Look at me now I done found me a

[Verse 2]
Method to all the madness
Checkin' my back, checkin' my hands
Checkin' in cash, and checkin' and balancin'
Hard work, callouses
Gripping the challenge by the cabbage
And bl-bl-blackin' 'til it's no longer a factor
Murder the, murder the game, kill it
Metaphysical living, deranged vision
Not a typical picture, the same limit
But I'm limited edition, I change prisms
Am I trippin'? A nigga be trippin'
I'm feelin' like most of you niggas be slippin'
I'm giving you tips and a nigga just went with it flippant
Not sayin' you stupid, but hella reminiscent
Of a stupid nigga, what they do to niggas
Kill or shoot a nigga (Die!)
Wow, then recruit a nigga, boot or suit a nigga
Send em to the other side
Is you gon' buckle up for the ride?
Niggas is fuckin' tough 'til its buckin' time
Bet they motherfuck, better buckle down
Cause I'm coming up nigga, hella mounted
Know my name cross hella counties
(Hey J.I.D, hey) What's up shawty?
Been around the world, ooh yeah
Let me tell you 'bout it
Keep your shit cool, melancholy
Keep your tool shit metabolic
Get some money, niggas jealous
So him and his fellas come deliver hella bodies
Post robberies, another dead nigga no problem
You happy 'cause we doin' your job
I'm pulling everybody's whole card
I never play with little boy toys
I was busy inside of laboratories
Lookin' out the window like a labrador
To the bullshit I'm a matador
In the pulpit like God's son, not a daddy's boy
Cornered boar, carnivore, ready for any war
Send 'em forward, fifty more, plenty more
Gimme more, see me Lord
After me, no before he became
See me boy, see these boys
Gon' need CPR to be remorse
For these meteors, it's just me recording

[Verse 1]
Hi kids, wanna know what I did?
I do drugs, get drunk and promote violence
Everywhere I go I take my gun, even churches
Open carry in Georgia so save me a seat in circus
Fuck takin' Dylan Roof to jail, you should bring him to me and my niggas
On God there won't be a homicide
We'll keep him alive, give me four days, maybe even five
Just from Monday to Friday, I promise he'll cooperate
We'll snatch out one of his eyes, make it look him in his eye
Then scalp shave, then use his hide for black pride
I guess you would think I'm tryna incite a race riot, but naw
I like white people, I hate that guy
I never understood the mind of a person that wanna murder
And hurt people who tryna make a change and do good
If he wanted real war, he shoulda went to the hood
I would have felt better about it, I just had to acknowledge it, but

[Chorus]
Hi, My name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka J.I.D baby
Hi, My name is, what? My name is, who?

My English teacher called me nigga like in Junior High
Thanks a lot, I'll use this word the rest of my life
My nigga this, my nigga that, dawg where my niggas at?
Damn don't make me kill a nigga, god bring my nigga back
Use it in the wrong context can get a nigga smacked
Little-bitty bullet make a skinny nigga fat
Wait, Bonjour my shitty amour, where your nigga at?
Work? Ok, cool. Get drunk? Where the liquor at?
Basically, what I'm sayin' girls and guys are piranhas
My dawg, hit a chick raw, and caught the gonor-Rihanna
I just combine in a word because she was fine as Rihanna
Not sayin' I'm not sayin' nothin' about Rihanna, oh I'm sorry Rihanna
I ain't slept in 20 days, I'm a zombie lil' mama
I'm tryna pay attention this much for fuckin' insomnia
I'm cardinal, carnivore, hard as hard-on
A tryna be good and God on my side
I ain't vulnerable, it's the honorable

Hi, My name is, what? My name is, who?

Okay, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga
"
Again, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
Never had shit, never take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga
Give me everything
"

[Verse 1]
Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with, haven't came up
And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinking that they fucking with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
"Oh, my God, don't be mean to me"
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in the way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s

[Chorus]
Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
Never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you
"

[Interlude]
Uhh, let's go

[Verse 2]
Yeah
 yeah, yeah, what, um
Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan something
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

[Outro]
Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful
Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful[Verse 1: J.I.D.]
I had a dream, had a dream
Seen things, tryna paint a scene
Lot of weed so I don't really dream
More like a kush coma cuz this shit was distinct
Yea, I ain't go too deep just to tell you I'll be the king by the end of the week
Exit the stage to your left, take that front row seat, you've been impeached
She wet them sheets when I rap offbeat
JID DiCaprio, put a cap in your soul, dig deep
That nigga a fool, he shot the nigga midweek
Couldn't sleep for a week and he still on the streets
I'm just another man in the mind from the East
Had to put down the cleats when I picked up the beats
Rapping under my helmet, they throwing hail marys
Hellbent on being the best, I had to pick one so tell me somebody
Nah, that's just combat for you wombats
Your niggas react like tomcats to a strong bat
My niggas just tell me they want that so they hunt that
Taunt that until it's in a lunch sack, greatness
Get your show or your stage ripped, going ape shit
I'm just a nigga from the 6, hop off the grave-ship
Slave-shift, great shit, momma I made it
And I hope it never fades but it will one day
In the days that y'all got to suck seeds to fucking succeed
I'm in my all black tuxedo, hair nappy
JID Buckwheat
My girl tryna leave cuz she probably tryna fuck me
Probably tryna puff weed

[Interlude: J.I.D]
Blood on the leaves, blood on the leaves
They killing niggas for drugs, that's blood on the weed
Some dumb shit

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Initial, Check
Sweat drippin down my neck
Anybody's guess what a nigga gon do next
First chair, I can't rest
Middle names yet I'm anxious
These niggas ain't about they Hanes yet
Nightmares, I can't breath
Pain test, asteroid, I came blessed
Still, Spill Vill til they sorting out my will
Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, til they sorting out my deal
Southwest, where they sort it out with steel
Carnegie, Rockefeller, head out in Ben Hill
Hotter than that TEC that he caught off a deal
Had to keep him safe, keep his body count nil
Crazy like that man Joey Bad back in South By, standing next to strangers
He stepping on my J's but it ain't nothing, I'm humble
Can't wait to grab the microphone and make that thing run, tho
Drove 5 states just for 15 minutes
All through the hate just for 15 minutes
Make it even worse dog, yea we ain't hit it
Conscious up ended
Face so offended
Drugs help me blend it though
So now I'm high and low, you know
Tryna get a hoe, life reciprocals
She beg don't let her thighs go
I beg don't let my eyes close

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
Uh Huh
Come sit beside a suicide survivor
You can die tonight, bruh
You can die tonight, bruh
You can die tonight, bruh
Won't nobody find ya body if I hide ya
Lose ya like a lighter
Always been evasive when it came to conversation
Fuck whatever question you asking off top
Keep it locked like the ness monster freaking out the Scots
God is the best sponsor of my freaky thoughts, ooo wee
She's a freaky girl, She's a leaky faucet
On my semi tall shit
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy naw kids
What that got you feeling so important
Of course that's some bullshit
Got a following from these recordings
And now them courses in college, kinda pointless
Whatever, I enjoyed fucking every little spoiled bitch
Daddy had your life planned out 'fore you was born bitch and your rebellion was taking long dick
It's the nocturnal, Doc-turnal, hotbox burner, popping like cob kernel, Cobb County Counts
Always fucking with a dark person filthier than Pac murder files in a pile of dirty towels
Some real rabble rousers in your house
Cut the lights, close the curtains
Couldn't clean the bloody sheets cuz we drank all the detergent
Masturbating, so perverted
Only take it if you serve it
Only thank you if it's perfect
You forget this-ugh-like honey bun, let that pussy cum right on my tongue
I'll leave you undone
Lighten up, thunder to come
It's a conundrum, why you still trying to run even though we know your body is numb?
Niggas flexing like the party was fun cuz the populars attended
Blah blah, fuck them niggas
Underdogs are better winners
Bet a miller I could get your bitch then get her wetter, clitter than them pitter patter strokes that you give her
Spillage Village[Intro]
I, I am so grateful
I'm very, very, very grateful
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Uh
Alright, J.I.D and (Christo)

[Verse]
Y'all niggas need to lay off the drugs
Some of y'all need to lay off the dope
My niggas gettin' it straight off the boat
Pure cut, put it straight to your nose
I ain't nosy, but I know what I know
Mr. Know-It-All, "oh here he go"
I'm the GOAT, I never go with the flow
Throwin' shots, boy, it's blow for a blow
I'm the nigga kick the do' with the do'
I'm the nigga fuck the ho with the ho
I'm the nigga lit the blunt with the blunt
I'ma get it 'cause I want what I want
I'ma say this shit again and again
I'ma go and put this shit to an end
I'm the sickest with the pencil and pen
Hit the blunt and mix the Hen' with the wait
I'ma go ahead and lay off the Xans
I'ma fall back sippin' the lean
I gotta make sure my vision is clear
Oh God, no, it's not what it seems
Six, five, four, one, two, three
.45 tote, you know me
You don't want smoke, so what it's gon' be?
Gotta watch what you say when you lookin' at me
Lookin' at God, lookin' for leaders, lookin' for keys
Look at the pain in your eyes, nigga, look where we been
Look at our wins, look at our sins, and look at our skin
I've been on a frenzy binge tryna get me a Benz
And then your fuzzy ass lens wanna fuck up the ends
Oh God, no, where are my friends?
Lord forgive me, yeah, I need to repent
Mind blurred, need to lay off the drugs
Yeah God, they ain't prayin' enough
Niggas dyin', we ain't sayin' enough
Cops fire, stockpiling rottweiler
Tell my little niggas lay off the stuff
Ronald Reagan, I can't thank him enough
Nah, I'm playin', nigga racist as fuck
Told my nigga if he leave a pack of ports around me, I'ma take em'
And throw em' away
He smoke em' around me, I'ma break em'
And we almost had got into fightin'
I'm talkin' 'bout dead that, finna fade it
But shit, but maybe I did too much
But fuck it, I love my nigga, I'ma save him
And he prolly thinkin' I'm a player-hater
I don't hate a player, I just need all my niggas to wake up
And take a real good look, we a long way from Decatur
Long days still ahead of us, grown dads still scared of us
I'm just workin' my incredible
Stick my dick in the inevitable
So fuck whatever happen, fuckin' cinematic
Sins of the father, I'm a fuckin' addict
Understand addiction, so I'm sympathetic
But I know, I know, I know that I gotta be strong
I ain't tryna be where I don't belong
Little syrup sippin' out of a foam
Little powder, put the pot in the bong
I ain't trippin', I ain't sayin' it's wrong
But, it's some other shit we can be on

[Bridge]
Gangsta Gri-zillz
Oh, now that I may be free, yeah
And he, he...

[Outro]
...if you need it
Yeah
'Cause we the old people, you know
That's way you get blessed
Yeah
That's comes to you, people don't know
Bless, you can see it
God, He come, He come, He come
He come depending what... what you do to people
Uh-huh
That's where bless come from, you know what I mean?
Yeah
You see, you can see that
Look at that, look at how fast President Reagan dead
You don't know him right?
Yeah, I did
Right okay, He was a criminal, you know what I mean?
But look at... at Jimmy Carter
Uh, uh
Jimmy Carter all... more older than Reagan
Uh, uh
Reagan gone already, Carter still here
The good person?
You know what I mean, 'cause he got a open heart
He never do war, when he was President
He never hurt nobody, he help people[Chorus]
Oh my God, we 'bout to go to Wells Fargo
'Cause I'm probably [?] to get a old cargo
Oh my God, we pull up like a [?] car show

Father God in heaven above

I'm [?] on the drugs and I'm outta my mind

Put this shit on my tongue
[?] shot of Hennessy [?]

[Verse 2]
He without sin cast the first [?]
To my nigga with the gun that can run in your home
Well dome shot niggas, never look at him wrong
Oh my God, Oh my God
Get a [?] twisted, cum in a bitch, suck on my dick
[?] on your sister, come, come, give me some
Tum, tum, get it done
Yum, yum, yum, i'm twisted

[Chorus]
Oh my God, we 'bout to go to Wells Fargo
'Cause I'm probably [?] to get a old cargo
Oh my God, we pull up like a [?] car show
[?][Verse]
Woopty wop, whatever
Slay I'm really feeling like Lane Kiffen
In your lane switchin'
Flick on the lights, your dame missing
Iraq, my aim dipping
Sex, giving texts, I'm reffin' you fuckin' peasant
I'm present, you fuckin' reffin'
Wait, I'm not a present, my presence is not a gift
More like a gust of wind or a whiff of shit
But I'm clean and I clean the murder scene with a 'Wiffer bitch
Then go and get your bitch on some Stiffler shit
Stiffer dick than your mans
She hate short niggas so she judge me by the height of my pants
'Fore we fuck, flick the light in advance
I don't wanna be surprised in the morning if you frightening 'cause baby girl
Look, I'm ordered by the lord's steps
My cologne's like the lord's breath
The drum on that tommy gun like a constant qu-qu-quartet
Young niggas get mad and you can get your door wet
You can get the whole set
Think about Africa when I see them stores that be buying gold back
Think about slappin' you, actin' like you own capital
Put the whole world on my back, crackin' my clavicles
But it don't really matter
I'm coming back from sabbaticals
Got my nine cocked, Simba standing on pride rock
Poppin' a couple shots at the eye of a cyclops
We don't fight box, put that boy in a pine box
Just call it a time stopper
Fox 5 choppers in the sky
With the chopper, so don't try to play the guy
If you tryna say goodbye
C'est la vie, au revoir
Hasta la, vista and nice to meet ya
That P-90 turn a punk into a pasta pizza
Slice a piece up, get your t-shirt
Your "R.I.P." shirts
Your "should've never tried J.I.D" shirts
The only reason we hurt people, 'cause nigga we hurt
Look at J.I.D, subject leapin', I'm not a lemur
In a Beamer, Willie Beaman
Crack your head like a pecan, or pecan
East side nigga from Bouldercrest to Redan
Staying in my G stance
Sticking to the p-lan, nigga we ain't p-laying
Sitting on my hands, having the world at my feet
One foot in your ass while the other straddles the street
Saddle my steed like it's 1873
But I got a weapon with me and I'm ready to eat
Metal to meet to settle the beef
You got a vendetta with me?
Niggas get dragged like Edelman in a cover three
I'm on your bitch ass, Baretta hit him, he fell asleep
You such a sick ass, I did it nigga, you tellin' me
Intellegently though
So for the bills he might Belichick you bro
We in the field if I recollect correct, with hella debt and neck to neck
Better yet, get a TEC for disrespect
Ready set go, steady and slow, let it explode
Eyes on the road, they looking for niggas like me and you
Scared of the future, scared of what we can do
I jumped off the stoop before two
Shit I jumped off the roof with those dudes
Mama asked if they did it what is you gon' do?
Drop with a parachute
Gotta get the guap, keep the pots full of kallalou
I'm gon' shine, but what's lights to a caribou
Got my nine while you niggas been backstabbing you
I'ma skedaddle, watch your life crackle
You a trip on the gravel, I done added up every atom in the sets to compatibles
Manifested an antidote and a flow that can catapult me out of Atlanta
Pour a four in my Fanta
Please excuse my manners, crack a smile for the cameras
Tie my bandana up, swag my stance a lil
Sag my pants a lil
Just took a trip to my city, it's a landfill
Not even on camera, you can get hit with the handheld
Dropped at a standstill, left that man ill[Intro]
I need me a fat blunt
Smoke something
Humble as a mumble

[Verse]
Long day at the office and when I get home
She find some bullshit to pick out, trip on
Talking about who this chick that just sent a pic to your shit phone
I know who she meant, but I act as I don't know shit
I don’t know shit holmes
That bitch on my dick, that's probably why she sent a pic
My chick don't know ’cause if she did, she would trip
And tell her friends to come and get, come and get, come and get
Come and get, I don't know shit
She don't believe me so I'm leaving
Tell my niggas to grab a bag of weed
But that don't make sense 'cause 'bout a hour and thirty minutes later I'm hollering "baby, please, baby"
You son of a bitch
You gone piss on me and tell me it’s rain
What, do I look like a lame?

[Outro]
Fuck, you just always, fuck
Nagging and whining
She always nagging and whining
Yeah
I told her just stop nagging and whining
Nagging and whining and crying[Verse 1: Jordxn Bryant]
Yeah
Father forgive me for my sins
Forgotten bout me for so many years
So many Ls I can guess the reason why I ain't in XX
Complex why I'm coppin doves for less
My nigga is the source there's love for that
Light a [?] I'm levitatin
Gravity's a bitch my ankles gettin grabbed by Satan
Damn I need a change of scene
My vibe on fuck a magezine
My niggas know this more than just a dream
I'm more than just a King it's more than just a name
I don't even want the fucking fame
I want my fam to be more fucking fortunate
So no handouts I want the hand now with the motherfuckin torch in it
Uh, to many blues not enough yellow women to tell them that green coming soon, greed coming too, seas coming too
Family members I can't remember them coming in June
But they present now who the peasant now
Could have been the one the ville never found
Could have packed 2s
If I did would you still come around

[Refrain]
Ooooohhhhhh
Heeeeyyyyyy
Oooooohhhhh
Heeeeyyyyyy

[Verse 2: Hollywood JB]
Hold your head up high
Why we hide our pride behind that camefolage
Why we think it's okay to live life in disguise
Why we look to the skies
Why we construct our demise
Better put more faith in your God
I really need to talk
Aye yo God, when we gonna spark in the...
WHy said I'd try, I said swear to
He said you swear to me then don't lie
Imagined if you worked as hard as you've cried
Can point you to the stairs but it's on you to climb
To the peak
I'm annointed when I speak
That's what kept me out the streets
Kept my enemies at my feet
Kept the Devil under me
Everything I want is right in my reach
So close I can raise a toast on every coast on every beach
Let's set sea
It's only
To see us succeed

[Refrain]
Ooooohhhhhh
Heeeeyyyyyy
Oooooohhhhh
Heeeeyyyyyy

[Verse 3: J.I.D & Hollywood JB]
(Father)
Never said this shit was easy so make shit make sense
I make shit, shape shift, makes swift movements to sink ships
Or bandwagons I view the world I gotta have it
In my palms I can write a song, write a song
Revolutions coming right along
I seen it, I dreamed it, can taste it
I see the look on niggas faces
I never look but they adjacent
So things off safety, on my waist
Enemies close kinda like this .38
Years older basic kill a nigga round
Try it sometime, write easy rhymes, I lose sleep
Daily, daily, nightly, nightly
Hope the Doctor Doc don't try and fight me
Strike of lightining when I write enlightening
Para tu, para you, pair of these for your girl and your main squeeze
Please Ms. Thing, don't bring drama to my scene
J.I.D para tu I sing, And as for you
I never said I couldn't do
So I does as should you, Para Tu
The weed burns so slow
So, so slow as for you I pull two
Para Tu Para Tu[Verse]
I told you fuck niggas proceed with precaution
Everybody in here's a target
Even your girlfriend, watch me aim with my sausage
Unload the clip then reload the monster
Inhale the ganja, wack emcees get to the back
They tried to step to the mack, and they got jacked
Rolling through the east looking for the man with the pack
Not Pac-man, the damn cornerback, fucking goofies
Kinda sorta, finna Kama Sutra with your boo-ski
Only if its Tuesday, she might be in love, only in the movies
She only prolly want me cause of the diamonds and the rubies
Overseas in the jacuzzi, eating pussy, I fucked her, what a doozy
I tell the coach put a nigga in, let me spin like I'm Poopie

[Bridge]
Miles Davis
I'll play the drum to your heart, even the bongo

Yo, dikky di dikki di dikky da
Yo, I tell you the rest on the day that we die

Cut the lights, close the blinds
Cut the lights, close the blinds
How peculiar? (Haha)
How peculiar?
Cut the lights off

[Hook]
How peculiar? It's as if the whole world isn’t moving
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Is it me? Nigga nah
How peculiar? It's as if the whole world isn’t moving
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
Is it serious? Nigga nah, nah

[Bridge]
You can't be serious, nigga (How peculiar?)
You can't be serious, nigga (How peculiar?)
You can't be serious, nigga (How peculiar?)
You can't be serious, nigga (How peculiar?)
You can't be serious, nigga (How peculiar?)

[Verse]
Yeah, I love her hair, I love her flavor
She just waiting on a nigga to save her
She was waiting on a nigga to chase her
And when my niggas not around, I probably will face her
She look so small and mouth so loud
She stuck sometimes, but that's her style
And whenever I’m in another nigga town I browse and look til that pretty bitch found
Cali girl, she came from the Westside (the Westside, the Westside)
And I’m from the Eastside like Reggie Brown
And all I smoke is the medical
And all I smoke is the medical
Let a fool drink, let a fool smoke
Let 'em do shrooms, let ’em do coke
Niggas on pills, birds got gills
Fish got wings, snakes on feet
Everybody say, everybody say "cut your fucking grass"
Everybody say
(Aye y'all niggas ain't high like me)

[Hook]
How peculiar? It's as if the whole world isn’t moving
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Is it me? Is he serious? Nigga nah
How peculiar? It's as if the whole world isn't moving
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Is it me? Is he serious? Nigga nah, nah

This is my motherfuckin' cakewalk
One more time again, I call it my motherfuckin' cakewalk
Motherfuckin' is not in the title, but I call it shit
My motherfuckin' cakewalk, 'cause it's a cakewalk, you feel me
I'm out here, shout out to, uh
Shout out to Carlo Terevani, my white boy
Up there in Canada doin' your thing
Shout out to Tay James, one time for Tay James
No, no no, two times for Tay James
And ten times for goddamn Jack Swain
We out here, we doin' this thing, you feel me
This is my cakewalk[Intro]
Be you
You focus on one, you'll never be two
And then number two, most niggas see through
But now that I think, that's probably number three too
Huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Y'all want that real shit back, then please say so
You niggas got it Manti Teo'd
On the eighth show
I'm walking 'round with the eighth tryna fuck Jhene Aiko
However you say the name
I cream that pussy like a bagel
You know how the play goes
Stunt a little then lay low
Names, never say those
Your girl in Giuseppes on Quavo
Dancing on top of tables
I'm finna pick six like 22 with son Tadoe
I hop in her whip, she bumping Gucci Mane and Zaytoven
She get in mines I'm bumping Beethoven
Its to the crib ain't gotta say nothing
I send her back to ya
Blood drained, J.I.D. and yes the "D" for Dracula
Crack her back play the sax, call Satchmo
He ain't gon' react
Just relax bro, it ain't for a show
I'm just waterin' my lawn 'cause I turn on the hose

[Chorus]
Rule number one: be you
You focus on one, you'll never be two
And then number two, most niggas see through
But now that I think, that's probably number three too

[Verse 2]
And then number four is like pour D'ousse D'ousse
Now this the wrong book, I'm looking at the wrong rules
Cause then number five says "purchase a coupe"
All black no shoes, then T-top the roof
And then get your windows and doors bulletproof
So the shots can't come in
But then we spray out the roof
Dog niggas like "ROOF" at your bitch like a wolf
Or a pack of Spill-niggas, government my own troops
Give me some of that Gil-Scott, bitch turn on the loops
Motherfuck your drums, I'm finna spit it to the flutes
Talk around my city, just point him out who got the juice
Couldn't quote my shit, you'll probably break a fucking tooth
You're talking about Richter scale, I earthquake the fucking booth
I shake it 'till its fucking loose, so fuck a rapper, fuck a cougar
Put my dick like right into her
Fuck a mattress, fuck theatrics
Unless your ass is an actor
Then fools need to be captured
I'm the master, I'm the massa'
And they wanna assassinate me
Why they wanna hate me?
I just need a cure for these rap bar rabies
And a Beijing bitch to come massage then rape me
Xvid tape me
Taste these kids then I'm on back to my day scheme
You living single like Regin and Queen La
I'm prolly coaching your team, I'm J.I.D, JoePa
My D.C. girl tell me she love Sosa
Put her hair in a pin, bang bang in O-Block
Shots rang, cops came, nigga no sir
Arrividerci and bonsoir
Yeah[Intro: Doctur Dot]
Niggas ask me how I'm living, I tell ’em to ask my ancestors

[Chorus: Doctur Dot]
Introduce that man, left lane lining
Dead brain shawty
Spirits bounce they head at the back of the party
Left lane lining
Dead brain shawty
Spirits bounce they heads in the back of the party

[Verse 1: Doctur Dot]
Okay, my man you still boulevard, I avenue, zone who?
I'm off the southern coast of France reading [?]
Ocean views, paper in the morning with my orange juice
Stick that nasty language to her she becoming foreign too
I solo, I need a mil' to hold ’em up like like some pyramid doors and i mean seriously -
Hold up, hold up, bruh
Pussy started drippin' like a mango when I bit that
And I got that hammer times a hunnid whoever you been with

[Interlude]
Purple paradise baby, take the panties off that grape soda and put your face in those [?]
The face of God is seen clearly, better keep your distance
Set your expectations

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
My DNA contains some strains of everything
Everybody's fingerprints, all the blood is in my veins
I could beat you running backwards ain't nobody in my lane
I'ma keep keepin' on 'till the beacon shone
French glass dope [?]
[?]
Tappin' on the pussy I’ma bash it in
And get some practice in
Uh I’m Uh fearless, rockin' some weird shit I ain’t famous enough to wear yet, It's duly noted
Then I started with a problem, then I turned it to an opportunity
Look at me when I'm talking to you, son, please
You don't like me when I’m silent you gon' hate me when I speak so it's best you keep your distance and investigate your seat
Learn to take advantage of my circle stances
Today you're standing, tomorrow vanished

[Verse 3: Stillz]
Big [?], big pockets, big bank, bent wallets
Been had it, you just got it, Henny mixed with my hypnotic
6'4, hydraulics, you pussy niggas want no problems
No gold teeth just gold Pradas
We drive phantom, ghost riders
Ghost riders, we drive phantom, ghost riders
[?] back and they profile us, cut the cheque they wan' co-sign us
So fly we need co-pilots, not freestylin' I'm co-stylin'
This hard work meets mo' talent
We the best nigga, no Khaled
Gift-wrapped, my flow should come gift-wrapped
No roadblocks, no setbacks, my moral cleared, my meds had
That OG be my jetpack, my wrist cost about ten stacks, she looks good but her friends wack
All black and them rims match
Homicide I kill tracks, bet you bitches gon' feel that
It's so real she real [?] and she realise this real's back
Nigga, pressy

Purple paradise baby
Purple paradise baby
Purple paradise baby

[Verse 4: J.I.D]
My dick so polite it stand up and let lil shawty have a seat, a-sit down leave the workin' to me
I fulfil her needs and leave when I am ready, but pay me my couple G's, dope dick delivery incorporated
You see, that's a side-job I been up on my crime mob, fly boy pouring Sean Don on a bitch, huh pause
And listen to these niggas best I kill 'em with some side bars
Besides, y'all know I been kickin' shit inside your iPods
Takin' food off they plate, they losin' weight, niggas checkin' they thyroids, examination, on this shaky slate
I just got my style on, poker face, Kobe face
After this shot is shot, in your face, pick your lip up
Then-then-then I tell the squad to pick a brick up I don't get my hands dirty I quit that at 12:30
I can give you my man number who serve all the birds, he just keep the 45 but he worth the customer's service
My paradise is purple[Verse 1]
Um, give me a sec
I'm just adjusting the proper presets to set the tone
Settle down, set in stone
Gather round, cop a squat
You should have an idea what this about
I was tryna be a little better than before I was
The king that I am before I was
The guy I is to-now, tonight, to-now
To write, to verbs, to fuck, to curve, to live, to die
To seize the day, to ease the pain, I breathe a J
To live, to love, to life you lay,  you lie, you down, you suck, you flesh, you fucked, it's cool, I'm fed, i'm up
I shed my tusk, you touch my ting, get bled and bust, get fed and bruh, you gotta chill with the extra
Boy, I'm gettin hungry and the rap game a restaurant
Tummy hurting now, where the restroom?
Sneeze, cough, fart, nigga bless you
Call all of my white friends 'nigga' because I'm ethical
Ever got beat with a bat until you turned vegetable?
Had some beef now he broccoli inside the medical
All over jokes and ridicule
The pedestal set, incredible shit, the belly was sick, his mind was glitched, he let off a clip
Him hit, Him miss, Him hit, Him spit this chick beautiful, bystanding witness
Damn all on some bitch shit
Nigga came from poor, can I have some more? on my Oliver Twist shit
Oliver Twist spliffs cuz he fuck with the big shit
Whippin' a Bisquick for a sniff of the lit lit
My nigga change drugs now he change drawers
Also from winter to fall, you got a cough? He slang Halls
I bought one of them thangs that bring coffins
Fox 5, my nigga, coffins

[Pre-Hook]
Ok now what makes a motherfucker gangster?
Pull up on the scene with the banger, no please and no thank you's
Or is it that strong nigga that take care of his family?
Fuck the scene up and then take care of the damages
Shoots ring out, the whole spot start scrambling
They got range, them bullets Anthony Hamilton
With bad aim, them killers from off of Candler and Campbellton
From the East to the West, long trip in the ambulance

[Hook x2]
That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance (Eastside to Stone Mountain)
That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance
That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance (Cascade to Bouldercrest, a long way)
That's a long trip, a long trip in the ambulance

[Verse 2]
I say hakuna matata
Not worried, you can do nada
I dip my shoters in Prada, you can get dropped in that Aquafina
Fela in my speakers, I'm so surprised you can see us
See us, see it from afar, don't throw a rock at a star
If I'm Aladdin, I would've just pulled the Glock on Jafar
I'm hittin licks and I'm flippin it, come and shop with the boy
She doing dicks and she pretty lit but I'm straight on it tho
You make a living, you cool with it, I can't hate on it tho
Y'all niggas need to get your motherfucking mind right
Nigga light me, hit you from the blind side
Toss 3, get clipped like a mine site
Don't drip blood on concrete
Damn, gin drop by the sunlight
Been a long day and a long night
Damn, always something, right?
Never chill, can't relate
Do it again, back to back
Back to back, back to back
I love practice, practice crack but the shit I do, you can't practice that damn
Damn did it again
There I go, shitted again
Go places I shouldn't have been
Then again

[Pre-Hook]
Alright now what make a motherfucker gangster?
Pull up on the scene with the banger, no please and no thank you's
Or is it that strong nigga that take care of his family?
Fuck the scene up and then take care of the damages
Shots ring out, the whole spot start scrambling
They got range, them bullets Anthony Hamilton
With bad aim, them niggas up off Candler and Campbellton
From the East to the West, long trip in the ambulance

[Hook x2]
That's a long trip, long trip in the ambulance

Hold on Jack Swain
I forgot the most important shout out, Jack Swain
Shout out to this mother fucking money we about to make, god damn
Shout out to all this guala guala stupid dollar bills we about to make, god damn
Shout out to everything we doing, you feel me?
This J.I.D, wag effortless

Shout out to god damn my brother
Shout out to everybody I fuck with
If I don't fuck with you then fuck you
J-I-motherfucking-D
That shit recording? Alright

[Verse]
’Cause my True Religion jeans look better with the holster
And I'ma show you mine if you get any closer
Eastside soldier, big blunt roller
Introduction to me, can you scoot the fuck over
Elbow room, please
Grab the Glock, squeeze
Sorry did I sneeze, wipe it on my sleeve
Motherfucker, I'm me to the death
And the game was slowed up, so we had to kill the ref
Choke him with his own whistle right after he take a breath
I’m the shit, cook it up, I'm the chef, believe that
'Cause see that the green stacks in the safe
And If you fuck with me, I'ma have to go Planet of the Apes
King Kong shit
Murder you then smoke out of my green bong, shit
Cut off your dick, your balls for ping pong shit
But we on shit, stacks on stacks
And if my mixtape, it's gone be stacks on that
And if that don't go well, we can come up with some tracks
And if all else fails, nigga crack on tax
Straight up, yo me and [?] been had our weight up
I'm always doing work in my LV gators
Keep the AK in the trench for the haters
You talk shit now, your ass sure will die later
You feel me? You feel me?
Pull up with the semi, I pull up in a semi
I pull up and they hear me, then leave in a Bently
I don't think they feel me and I don’t think they hear me
They tried to offend me and now I’m full of Remy
My temper [?]
Quick, quick with the grand slam
Bitch, I'm Kenny Lofton
Oprah the flow, why does he keep talking?
I call my heat often
Or in, my case the money comes often
Listen up, pay attention, I’m talking
So listen up, pay attention, I'm balling
All over the court
All in the night time, morning keeps talking
I keep talking, I'm hearing
I'm tired of hearing this track
Therefore I’m off it[Verse 1]
Alright
Niggas be half-mad and a man paralyzed
Can't even use his legs and thighs, ready to ride
I'm ready to die's a lie, I gotta live
Nice ride, machete inside, you gotta chill
Nighttime, spaghetti and fries, we make a meal out whatever's in the fridge or some shit I done pilfered
Send a dick pic to ya chick, no filter
Too much swag, I could sell a house to a realtor
Realtor
Real talk
I'm on my real ting shit
A king of oneself, on my clothes, in my mink set
My mindset
Bad white girl and a fine set of twins on her chest and her kids
745 Benz, left her old man
Simply, cause I put that endi in Fendi
All by my lonesome, I'm lookin' for an Olsen
Twin, there I go again
Slow-mo approachin' a Benz
Window rolls, and the smoke billows from the ocean wind
Makin' a (?)

[Chorus]
Nigga, let that snub nose sneeze like achoo!
He can make that snub nose sneeze like achoo!
I can make the snub nose sneeze like achoo!
I could make the snub nose sneeze like achoo!
Young nigga blessin, blessin, blessin, blessin
Nigga, let that snub nose sneeze like achoo!
You can let that snub nose sneeze like achoo!

[Verse 2]
Alright, y'all would keep it cool if you knew the shit that I knew
I know, but you ain't gon' listen for your survival
You just a cool guy, accompanied by a fly hoe
Who just a fly hoe, she'll fly away on bottles
Couple nights in Cabo, bottles, come swallow
She with another man on that same shit tomorrow
You with another chick, she flew you in from Chicago
She wanna be where you go, where I go
I'm J.I.D Leonardo
DiCaprio, put a cap in yo soul in an arrow
Mo' 4, 5-0
Woah, woah, drive slow
That's only cause nobody's on top of us
We know they watchin' us, bifocal binoculars
On clock and they clockin' us
Skin black so they lock us up
Fuckin' debauchery
I wrote this, on Absolut and obsolete
Blunt full of Socrates
Modern-day me
The comparisons is cool, but it stops at the door
Nigga, locks and the Glocks and the dogs
Take off yo shoes and yo cool
Matter fact, don't move, just join the movement
The Spill-Vill revo-fuckin-lution

[Chorus]
Nigga, let that snub nose sneeze like achoo!
He can make that snub nose sneeze like achoo!
I can make the snub nose sneeze like achoo!
I could make the snub nose sneeze like achoo!
Young nigga blessin, blessin, blessin, blessin
Nigga, let that snub nose sneeze like achoo!
You can let that snub nose sneeze like achoo!

[J.I.D]
I grew too fast and I knew my daddy
I roll my fatty and zone now
I'm on the phone with a shone who tell me pull my bone out
I'm coming home now
I'm really on now

I need everything

[Isaiah Rashad]
I put myself before these hoes
I gotta a couple of kin
I left it wet for your nigga
I'm from the motherfucking South, put the pipe in her throat
Since my little brother told me hold it down, I'm coming straight out the door
You want it back, I brought it back[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm hella inconsistent when it come to some bitches this A.K.A fuck me over I'ma fuck some of her sisters
And this shit's already twisted 'cause I fucked some of her sisters, I opened it up, dicked in, and I stretched it like a gymnast
She said she wanted to end it 'cause she wants us to have friendship, she said that via text and that's hell of a way to end shit
And then I felt silly 'cause I let Siri read it to me
It's a bad feeling inside my tummy put some loud to it
Express my pain through my music, let the crowd do it
They all like my style because I'm wild foolish
I hit a bitch with a smile and tell her I'll do the honours of being your bone jumper
Ugga ugga, a caveman descended of slave damn, who used to grow that weed in the cotton fields nigga amen
Brought my grandparents greats used to wake and bake, so for them, I'ma take a [?] to the face
You scrape, You scrape

[Interlude]
Yo, what's good?
Oh so now you wanna answer the phone? Where the fuck have you been in?
I've been waiting on yo' ass, where have you been?
Don't even answer that 'cause I don't want a goddamn answer I'm over this shit now
I was waiting on yo' ass last night, in the house, in the bed [?]
Fuck that, and fuck you, and fuck everything you're about, you ain't ever gonna be shit, you ain't shit 'till the day you die nigga your momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit, your uncle ain't shit your auntie ain't shit, your whole family ain't shit
[?]

[Verse 2]
Uh
Typical night, invisible white, my visions entice my delights [?] the fucking lights
And salt's getting thrown like rice after the invite
So the join of two beams you ain't feeling what I'm seeing so I'm leaving
And I won't leave with no fucking demons, so I'ma place all my sins on the damn table, in front of God and whoever able to see the fables I created
Lies, imagination, and hatred
Death to making love, without really actually love making, faking it just to get you naked, flexin' and flakin'
I'm a filthy nigga face it, but not just too complex to fuck with someone basic, That's a overstatement[Verse 1: J.I.D]
A lot of hair on the pussy, I can't see it like Sia
You should shave that shit, and I'll wear it like a mink
Kill the pussy, now they gotta call PETA
No animal cruelty
I been just waiting on my cut like a jewel thief
Ye'en in love shorty
Coudl've fooled me
Raised my nephew but he could've schooled me
A pure child showed a nigga how to be true to me
Let's not get too deep, cause this our first time
I'ma dumb it down, nigga this my nurse rhyme
My verse in cursive adverse the divine, signed with my signature
Out of my mind, smoking good gas in the lituation
Gotta a whole zip for the situation
All black, you can take a picture baby
With a middle finger, tell em we don't give a fuck cause we know they hating
If they want war, tell 'em go when you read
Head nod, let me know when you ready
The way it's looking, now this shit could blow any second
Tryna drive, you don't know where you headed
Just let me know when you ready
Look bitch, you guessing, that shit evident
Hypothesize yo' motherfuckin' experiment
Come back strong on your Marion Berry shit
Risk embarrassment, but uh, get the check

[Hook: 6lack]
Hand on the bible, other on the rifle
I wouldn't take another step, that's if you know what I know
I'm sitting here trying to calculate
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
I look at everything around and I feel if I don't get it right this time, then I fail
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle
Main chick, main chick, main chick


[Verse 2: J.I.D]
No hair on the kitty, shit bald like chemo
J.I.D, Larry, Michael Jordan, Kobe at the free throw
J.I.D, lion, leopard, tiger, sniper with a rifle on the Eiffel, African, fish, eagle
How statistical, I got a big ego
Never seen an animal like this before, started with one style
Then I switch the flow, got an ol' lady, but I make this beat me ho
I just squeeze the load, yeah baby, I'm nasty
And you remind me of Skin Diamond and Cassie
And if you love my bark, then let me bury my bone and you can bring that shit back like Lassie
Voila, magic, frantic, frivolous, mischievous friends with the indica
Living life lavish, likewise learning life lessons and letting shit happen, pray to god from Sunday until the sabbath

[Verse 3: 6lack]
Why everywhere we go, them ladies flock like a pageant?
And it don't help the fact that I'm ?
It's holographic
I be trying to keep the peace, they want me to do the damage
Damn, like please let us get the cabbage
And blow that purple like radish
Damn, bitch, holy smokes, roll the dope, hold the coke, we ain't trying to overdose
All I know is get it all 'til you overload
Coma, coma, coma, coma, 'til I'm comatose
She want that family life with a rock in it
I lean so hard I had to rock with it
No commitment shit, commitment to the game and I don't think it'll ever change, change, change

[Hook: 6lack]
Hand on the bible, other on the rifle
I wouldn't take another step, that's if you know what I know
I'm sitting here trying to calculate
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
I look at everything around and I feel if I don't get it right this time, then I fail
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle, main chick, side ho
What a life though
Rifle, Bible, Bible, rifle
Main chick, main chick, main chick[Verse 1: J.I.D]
My girl booty soft and it's shaped like a skrawberry
Her pussy bald with a tat like Stephon Marbury
Carry all my dirt to the grave, I'm the pallbearer
Bury all of my sins, staring out of the Benz
Gone off weed, gone off Hen', gone with the wind
Gone with the pretty long hair is with the fairest skin
Yelling in her face, and she repeat like a parrot and
Apparently she gone keep yelling at me, I'ma never win
Where your ass was at when I was sleeping on the couch
And in the whip?
Probably with another nigga, on another nigga dick
I'm on another tip, my skin so tint, strength on strength
One on ten against me, I won't break, I don't bend
Watch your statements, guard your chin
Guard your heart, guard your light
Find your zen, mind your lightness
You doing without cause you ain’t looking within
But if you ever in doubt give this a spin

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Check, look, cool
I mean shawty had relations that we never could speak about
You get mad, I'm mad, we sleep it out
And then she had a man who used to beat her
So she told me she wanted out
Got a couple abortions, now that pussy's a haunted house
Now her heart cold, Antartica, Siberia
Had it planned out, curriculum, criteria
Change, she feel pain, strain, built up anger
From dealing with a dickhead, putting her life in danger
I understand, it's times that you go through your women things
And sometimes can't gauge clearly on what you be thinking
I swear I got your back and got the tab on what you drinking
You ain't gotta move a finger or pinky when we linking
Whatever keeps your boat afloat or ship sinking
From loose lips of side women stepping out of position
Breaking out of a system, prison
Parallelogram, shaping the prism, stop signs never stopped I
Let's be realistic, I been trying to get in touch with my senses
And be better to my sisters
But niggas think that you feminine when you sensitive
My home girl rap, and she feminist
Hold it down for the women, I call her "Feminem"
Tell 'em how you really feel headass
Cause ass shots are dead ass and fake tits been around, we gas it
Girl you perfect without that make up or the plastic surgery
I'ma tell you how it is like Ron Burgundy

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down[Intro]
Activate, activate, activate, activate
Activate, activate, you know I'm about to activate
Activate, activate, activate, activate
Activate, activate
(Whoa Kenny!)

[Verse 1]
Activation, activation
Maturation, process, rap game too saturated
Grab your lady, masturbation on her face
A acne patient acting patient, so complacent
Comfortable, a basic bowl of shit
Hold my own, I own my dick
Go shalom, I’m unpredictable
And roll with the clique and fold with big clips
I know I'm feelin' activated when I came in this bitch
Claiming the 6, I don’t care about being famous and shit
I was a bad little never had, nigga get the bag
Give it back to my fam, boy I am who I am
Hope I don't get in a jam in a jam
Had a dream of eating lamb in the Lamb'
And the label come off fam with the ram
Like Martin, Gina, Cole, Tommy, and Pam
Start scheming boy, you die where you stand

[Beat Switch]

[Interlude: Jamaican DJ]
Now hear dis! You likkle spit and chew out soundbwoy
You mussi think you can go buy experience a Woolworth!
You mussi think a so King Selassie ah get him crown!
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no way!
You got to work hard for it!

[Verse 2]
Look, okay
This the type of shit that have niggas in beef
Dat slick talk followed by some stick talk then sleep
Pissed off, I done took my fifth loss this week
Big dog, I can scratch that shit off like fleas
I got a lotta shit to say, but I'ma keep my list short
I know alotta your favorites not gon' fuck with this part
When I'm done, please know that I was trying to diss y'all
'Cause if this is a competition, then I’m setting this bar
In my city, who’s with me? I'm in my own lane, Jack
Nigga said, "J.I.D. so flame, I propane rap"
I’m from East Atlanta like Gucci and Travis Porter
But my story is similar to the hare and the tortoise
Pen so sharp told stories you thought I forged it
Back in the fourth grade, never read Curious Jorge
My nigga Corey kept a little 40 inside his North Face
Left a nigga with no face and beat the court case
Coming home from ball practice, took the street the short way
We from the East, but never gave niggas a reason
To try it or think it's easy, soft pussy niggas eat the sorbet
Or eating your face, or squeeze the heat, then leaving your place
I've been telling you life's a bitch, but it’s a beach in your case
I've been yelling and throwing fits, I'm tired of screaming all day
I've been fighting these fucking demons all day
Man, this shit ain't never been easy, maybe I just need a breather
Hand your boy the blower, let me squeeze it
Blow a little steam, ain't hating, I'm just heated
Niggas know what I mean, but niggas don't know what I been through
So if I offend you then, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move until the rent due
My niggas hands itching, finna rob something
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you (Our Father)
Better pray to God

[Verse 3]
Look, okay
Fuck what a nigga say or, look, my mama think I made it
Lift my head to skies, I cry and begin prayer
Thanks to the maker, got me out of an awful place
My nigga gone for 17 years like a cicada
More than a motivator for me to get off my anus
And kick ass like I'm Danny Mainus
Put the pen pad to the paper, big mad with a painting brush
Splish splash, drawing scenes from my dim lit past
Dimwit, pimp shit, syndicate with the pen grip
Ripping shit, intimate, infinite rhyme kicking, l-l-let's begin
Who's your list? Your top 10? You can say whoever better than
I'm ready now, I was ready then, I was headed down the aisle
Rap game in a wedding gown, she gave me the ring
I said, "Yes" and vowed for forever now
On the honeymoon, getting naked now
On a money pile, doing doggystyle
I'm a father now, and you are my child
Or you aren't my child, I'm on Maury now
And I'm talking loud, the results are found
You are not the - wow, I should kill this bitch like a doggy pound
We divorcing now
I want the cars, ring, clothes, all the houses
And you broke my heart, I'm re-organizing
And I'm really trying to be mature about it
But I got a killer like a fucking dealer
Dream-villain, spill-villain rhyme to the ceiling
Would I should I kill a rapper 'cause I coulda
Duh nigga, this a gun and a bullet

[Chorus]
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move till' the rent due
My niggas hands itching, finna rob something
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you

[Outro]
Not that I need it
This nigga cap as fuck, man
Ain't no cap in my rap
This super cap in your rap, boy
Where y'all niggas from for real?
Where y'all from?
Naw
Ohhh[Intro]
Umm, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody wanna be something
Be something, don't be nothing
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody gotta love somebody
Everybody gotta fuck somebody
Love somebody, don't fuck anybody
Everybody gotta be something

[Verse 1]
Look, it's like quiet as kept, I been the sickest for a sec
I never been pressed for all the cameras and the press
I'm not the type of guy that be wildin' for respect
I'd rather be wildin' for a check
I'm doing that now to manifest, I got my head right and it's blessed
Yeah, the rap game like checkers and chess
And tryna make a monopoly, I got a lot of mess
But it's cool, I'ma test it
Got my choice route, I'm destined for greatness
Patience is cool, I had to learn that too
I had got kicked out of school like, "Nigga, fuck y'all rules"
And them niggas that snitched on me, yeah it's fuck y'all too
My momma hit a nigga phone like what the fuck y'all do? Nothing
I just finesse, I'll give 'em back all they little money
But everybody gotta juug somebody, huh
Everybody gotta juug somebody, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody wanna be something
Be something, don't be nothing
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody gotta love somebody
Everybody gotta fuck somebody
Love somebody, don't fuck anybody
Everybody gotta be something

[Verse 2]
They asked me "What's my sound"? I tell 'em nothing particular
I'm blowing this purple 'til I feel perpendicular
My flow crash like homicide vehicular
Leave a nigga's brain at the scene, sign for signature
Kicking rhymes as I'm flipping through the pages of literature
Literally, I'm the shit, what you having for dinner?
Born to win but born a sinner, and that's word to Jermaine
Cold flow, Cole World, but we living the same
I was standing in the hall, we was listening to Dame
He was schooling some niggas, putting them up on some game
I'm ear hustling, hoping my niggas doing the same
Shit, that he saying, my brain strain, combust into flames
He dropped gems 'bout life and getting up in the game
Or getting fucked in the game and how it's really kinda tough to complain
When you can be what you want, it not really much to explain
So fuck that, hustle for cream and go for the dream

[Chorus]
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody wanna be something
Be something, don't be nothing
Everybody gotta be something
Everybody gotta love somebody
Everybody gotta fuck somebody
Love somebody, don't fuck anybody
Everybody gotta be something

[Outro][Chorus: J.I.D]
I been so down on my luck and stuff ain't lookin' up
I need somethin' that's takin' me higher
And maybe I'm outta touch in a rush
And life been kickin' my butt but that ignited the fire
And maybe it's when I'm spillin' my guts
I know you don't trust me, you love me, instead you call me a liar
Or maybe you really hate me, you can't be
I need for somethin' to save me 'cause, little baby, I'm tired
Yeah

[Verse 1: J.I.D]
How you gon' dump me and then leave wit' my hoodie?
And you ain't comin' back, give me back my hoodie
And now you tryna make a scene at the movies
You really wanna act, bitch, we at the movies
I want my money back, I'm leavin' for goodie
And I get mad, I don't even wanna be here
And you get mad 'cause you don't even wanna leave here
And now it's bad 'cause we ain't even seen the previews
And now she mad, takin' shit to social media
And I just need you to tell me how you feelin'
And I just need you to come at me wit' real shit
Botherin' people 'cause we fightin' in the dark, yeah
We ain’t gotta leave but we gon' sit a seat apart (Yeah)
Uh, tears in the bucket of fuck-its
Fightin' and fuckin' and tusslin' and fightin' and fuckin'
Lovin', lovin' unless you lucky
I fuck wit' you because you real and you beautiful
But still, starin' at the screen only thinkin' how I feel
For real
I wanna share my popcorn wit' you
'Cause I won't eat the whole thing
But you still got an issue
And I been tryna sip yo' drink, meet the kid in the middle
But no, boo you, she just goes to the car
Pull up, she drove, didn't open the door
So cold, outside
And ya boy need a ride
Oh God, it's really a problem
And I'm so tired of

[Chorus: J.I.D]
I been so down on my luck and stuff ain't lookin' up
I need somethin' that's takin' me higher
And maybe I'm outta touch in a rush
And life been kickin' my butt but that ignited the fire
And maybe it's when I'm spillin' my guts
I know you don't trust me, you love me, instead you call me a liar
Or maybe you really hate me, you can't be
I need for somethin' to save me 'cause, little baby, I'm tired
Yeah, I'm tired, baby

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Hey, how you gon' leave wit' yo number on my phone bill? (Bill)
Look inside yo' wallet you got one bill (Bill)
Never got a job but you want chill (Chill)
Girl, that shit is unreal (Unreal)
I'm feelin' a little sluggish
You think I'm entertainin' all the rubbish
It's a no from me, dawg
I guess I gotta let you free fall
Flippin' through my shit like we in a gym, naw
I'm talkin' my shit 'cause I'm off the Hen', dawg
If I, uh
There ain't nothin' left to admire
I been listenin' to Mýa like woah
Don't you let the love turn to pyro
How you let it drag on? Spyro
Goin' 'em at right hand, spirals
I'm seein' Z after Z after Z
He, wait, who after me, huh? (Huh?)
Wait, don't actually explain it and I don't wanna know
I'm tired every time I come home
She all alone, it ain't my fault
I'm livin' life, she in the dark (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't got no bite, a lot of bark
I clear the room, so we can talk

[Chorus: J.I.D]
I been so down on my luck and stuff ain't lookin' up
I need somethin' that's takin' me higher
And maybe I'm outta touch in a rush
And life been kickin' my butt but that ignited the fire
And maybe it's when I'm spillin' my guts
I know you don't trust me, you love me, instead you call me a liar
Or maybe you really hate me, you can't be
I need for somethin' to save me 'cause, little baby, I'm tired

[Verse 3: Ella Mai]
Tired (Tired)
That makes two of us
I'm a liar (Liar)
Where's the truth in that?
I can't figure how you run your mouth
You been so down on your luck, and stuff ain't lookin' up
You need somethin' that's takin' you higher
Maybe you're out of touch in a rush
And life been kickin' your butt, but that ignited your fire
And baby, it's when you're spillin' your guts
You don't trust me, love me
'Stead he call me a liar
Oh baby, you really hate me, you can't be
You need for somethin' to say
'Cause, little baby, you tired
Tired

Rain vision
Not a typical picture, the same
Ain't nobody [?] the chained prison

I'm feeling like most of you niggas be slipping
I'm giving you tips and nigga just went with it
Flip it, I'm saying you stupid, but hella reminiscing
Never stupid nigga, what they do to niggas?
Kill and shoot a nigga (Damn!)
You recruit a nigga, blued and suit a nigga

Niggas is fucking tough till its bucking time
Then they motherfucked, better buckle down
Cause I'm coming up, nigga, hella money
And you know my lady puff hella chronic

I'm calling everybody home court, I never played like boy toy
And I'm busy inside the laboratory, meeting [?] like a labadior
Quit the bullshit, I'm a matador
In the pull pit like God's son
Lotta thing things, boy, carnivore, carnivore
Ready for any war, send me for fifty more, plenty more
Getting more, see me lord?[Chorus: JID]
I shot the sherrif
Killed the deputy
Spared the reverend

Snatch the necklace, [?]

[Verse 1: JID]
Back up, that's a warning shot, next nigga gettin' domed and dropped
And niggas beefin' on they phone and plottin'
And I can see you really love hip-hop, well I can make you meet Biggie and 'Pac
Tell 'em that the game miss 'em a lot, so if you thinkin' its a issue it's not, people entitled to opinions they got
You probably good as friend as you got, so if you poppin' shit and your friend get shot at the-
Age of 9 at 10 o'clock, but when he pop, at his top, and he drop, let it rock
I been on a fuckin' star trek like Spock
Glock cocked on the block workin' on my shot
Been the same since a runny nose with the snot
Then my nigga run into your home with a choppa like "gimme what you got do you really want the problem?", tryna make a milli off the rock
[?]
Watch a nigga watch, niggas on the block fake phones in the pocket
Lil partner was poppin' finna hit him with the rocket
Then your main chick tryna take me, probably 'cause I'm handsome, fly, and a fun guy like Shiitake
Nigga you really jockin' tryna Andy Milo-knock me off my rocker hell nah, partner, partner, hell nah
My nigga told me not to tell y'all but I'ma tell y'all

[Verse 2][Verse]
Damn, hella unfortunate
Fortunate fame is not the same
When your phase is important but lame
Gotta take this rap shit in small portions
I'm like Mike, who the fuck is up on the court with
I'm attacking the paint because I smell endorphins
Pocket check, pussy boy, I smell endorsements
Them shucking and jiving, JID jumped off the porch
I'm tired of being poor and begging for porridge
I need a Porsche and a crib in the forest
If they try to pop me, watch my eyes squint like Forrest Whitaker
Hit you from a distance
Good riddance, good day, and good business
Get on your [?] while the good is good
God gave me the jewels and I been on my juug with it
The rules be used and abused for you to lose
To lose the choice, don't choose, you in the blues
I move like a criminal, smooth
That can walk on the moon
They waiting for me to pop like bubble gum or balloons[Intro]
Christo
As we stand together in solidarity
Volatile villains we violate voluntarily
[?] or dare me, no stereo, too aware, too prepared
Suby, yeah, uhh

[Verse]
I'm a motherfuckin' NASA scientist with the pen
Half Leviathan strength, half giant
Intense criminal intent, big gentleman, big genitals
Big pendulum swing, [?] tip of the ring
Sharp tongue spark gun fight, niggas is slain
Blood trickles [?] in pain, dang
A little pencil [?] such a pivotal thing
Mix it with liquor and some chemical strains
[?] never pardon that individual
Sin him or kill him, give me the max or the minimum
Pull the trigger, kill as many millenials
In a minute, take the ball from the pen, tossed it, lost in the wind
Off with your favorite rapper head, we'll start with the limbs...[Intro]
Let's celebrate
Let's celebrate
A chicken birthday, a chicken birthday
Let's have a bo'party, a bo'party, a bo'party
Let's have a birthday

Pussy nigga proceed with precuation

Yeah I got the hand but I really hate to force it
J.I.D don't take no shit, I'm not a toliet
More like the target

Force feed the truth hear voices
Tryna get a trophy over my head I can hoist it
Be inside trapped by this pink pussy posion
Oh lord speak to me I hear you real noisy

Smoking out the room of course they would call it poison
Long fucking story
Anyway shawty say get money the bitches are comin

[Verse 2: J.I.D]
Pussy ass nigga I don't know what to tell you
All I can say is I've never been a motherfuckin failure
Used to be a football player never went on to the NFL
No pressure bitch because I'm barely five sev'
A buck 40 soakin wet
Fast but I smoke too many blunts to try and hit LeGarrette Blount
Pussy boy dunce
They bumpin our shit in fronts
You talkin special teams go and cover some punts
You niggas cunts
I guess it's kinda cliche that you only live once
But I'm reincarnated
Double play cause the pavement with Cartiers
Star blazing take the bump off the cross of your necklace
Take a shot too
Moonshinin it's all cool
Go and pick your girl up
It's a threesome in the carpool
Swaggin in her ear that bitch cummin on the bar stool
Given that bitch lower then the bar this is law school
Please remove your bra and your shwawl too
Haha

[Beat switch]

[Verse 3: J.I.D]
I'm goodie like Cujo but my name ain't Boris
Give your girl a chestnut but my name ain't Morris
Y'all ain't none of my brothers
Shit I got enough of them
Couple associates, friends
You don't fuck with me fuck em
Alot of rappers not even cuttin the mustard
More like cuttin the cheese
Cut them down to they knees
They eye level with my niece
Dome shots say please
Okay squeeze then
Leave with your girl make her queef
Sheesh I'm the underwater hotel fiji eating fried zucchini
You keep me playin my leading ladies say J.I.D just want the whole meeting
Meaning up with a kiwi
She freaky so she get me up
Get her off then get shit off
Nasty

[Refrain: J.I.D]
Ahh

Make it real, make it real nasty
I make it real ah
Make it real, make it real nasty
Make it real, make it real

[Chorus: Tylon Matthews]
Now it's been a minuite and I ain't speak to you
I see your ass whenever you call
But when I don't see you I know your doing good
I'm on whatever you ever you
I'm on whatever you on
I'm on whatever you ever you
I'm on whatever you on, on
I'm on whatever you on[Verse: J.I.D]
Yeah, I know you got a question, you looking for answers
Look at the passion I possess
The pain manufactured a champion
Stamp the game
My name lasts forever
The rain is coming
The thunder's crashing
Fire-breathing dungeon dragon
Take a chance
Inspire the kids that never had it
Own the chaos and you own the magic
Then say, "Why not?" to anybody who asking

[Bridge: J.I.D & Russell Westbrook]
I know you got a question, you looking for answers
I only have one answer...
Own the chaos and you own the magic
To all the questions you ask me...
Then say, "Why not?" to anybody who asking
Why not?[Intro]
Take your heart, don't let me break it in two
I'm sure that I could possibly do nothin' for you
I'm nearly on the edge, I'm bout to jump in a few
I'm really not afraid of nothin'

[Verse 1]
Look, on everything
I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called, "Where the fuck you at?"
"On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back"
I was blowin' gas like the Honey Badger
J.I.D, bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie, shit I'm coming after everybody
Don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too
Shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry cause I'm numb inside
If you wonder why, ask, "What's the matter?"

[Chorus]
Cause I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

[Interlude]
Quiet, don't explain
What is there to gain

[Verse 2]
Shit, shit ain't really working out, huh
Now I got a little bread, got my niggas working out, damn
Baby your ass fat, I can see you working out, shit
And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out? Heh
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
The difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
You got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead

[Chorus]
I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

[Outro: Zack Fox]
C'mon bruh, come to the booty club one time
Throw some of that Dreamville money
Throw some of that Dreamville money at these hoes, bruh
They got dreams too, nigga
They got shit to do too nigga
They got dreams too bruh bruh
Y'all Dreamville-uh aye aye, aye aye, uh uh
Next time you see that nigga J. Cole bruh
You tell that nigga the same thing man
I fuck with y'all niggas, bro, why that nigga J. Cole
Got all this money, look like he 'bout to
Borrow somebody charger or something
"C'mon bruh, let me get your charger bruh
Let me get my shit to uh, uh 10% percent
And I'll give this shit back to you bruh bruh"
C'mon bruh flex some of that Dreamville money, let me see it[Verse]
Fuck what a nigga say because my mama think I made it
Lift my head to the skies, I try to begin prayer
Thanks to the maker, got me out of an awful place
My nigga gone for 17 years like a cicada
More than a motivator, immortal and innovative
A dorsal and with pectoral fins
Swimming through the waves in course of habeas corpus
I'm orbitin' through my days, I'm fortunate
I ain't come in this bitch to be fuckin' famous
I just hope when you hear me that you hold me in high regards
Not as high as your God
Maybe the stars moving a couple mountains ajar
Ajayi, a juke move fitted up the side line, then a pylon
Biddy-bye-bye, di-did-di-die now
We don't let bygones be bygones
We buy guns and squeeze like a python until the night come
The bear to right, uhm, the right to bear arms so we could fight
I get my shine on, Belt of Orion, cut on the lights
And when I die just take me to Zion and kill me twice
It's like my second life, my second-second line
I put this noose around my neck just to accessorize
Ridin' in this coupe terrified
12 try and petrify a nigga with petty crimes
"How you feel about me don't matters like black lives
Nothin' even matters, dog," I heard that when I was five
That's around the same time my big brother had shown me his .9 and let me hold it
Literally what I call a 9 to 5
Ten times out of nine, I prolly wouldn't survive
But sun do what my gun do, rise
Guns drew, this the last hoorah
Takin' lives 'fore you dudes take mine
Take your time, these things take time, tickin', tickin'
Typical flow to keep you niggas on the tip of your toes
Lo and behold, make your temple explode
Give and go, pick and roll
Never listen to the rigmarole
This rigor mortis make your temperature cold
Woah, woah, I don't troll, bro, I been in my mode
I'm a full schizo with a duel Pistol, that's a cool visual
That pocket missle pop a pimple, hit him, he bent over
Give me the tempo, bika-bow, bika-bow-da-boom
It's a elephant and cow in the room
I'm in the Prague, bruh, how ya doin'?
You better bounce 'fore I make a move
Don't got the juice like you say you do
I'm finna be like a saber-tooth
Wreck a roof, any booth, anybody get it too, you ain't invisible
Shootin' at us, metaphysical, put 'em in critical, critical, uh
Finna get 'em, finishin' 'em, benefit 'em, then I'm finished with 'em[Verse]
Not that I'm the shitter
I just made me a Twitter
Your bitch hit me up and now I'm poking in her liver
She say her man real, but really I'm much realer
You had her smoking mid and I'm a purp dutch filler
Now let's talk about my skrilla
You see how fast the car go
Got so much bread I got robbed my Wells Fargo
I hit it like Harpo, I spill off in the Vette
On the way to my private port bout to leave in my private jet
Got a couple private bitches, privately getting badder
And they mad cause I'm not touching on they privacy
I'll rolling up, mama lay back, lay back in my Maybach
Lay back in my Maybach as I crack open up this eight pack
Lay back in my Maybach as I crack open up this eight pack
And stop touching on my eight back
I see through you just like Apex
DVD recorder, J.I.D immortal
Can't buy love, but I promise I can afford you
The way the shoes and the shirt fit so cordial
The [?] sit high, the scents on fire
The tint so fly, did I mention that I'm high
I can't explain on all the money that I spent on I
Well just explain all the money that I managed to acquire
You saying that I ain't hot, you's a motherfucking lier
You let the gay new boys get signed off "You're a Jerk"
You can't tell me that a man with my flow should not be heard
Bar for bar, word for word, I'm so disturbed
And I'ma be on top of my shit so I'ma turd
Keep your ears to the street, you nerd
Download it[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm 1 up, pussy nigga run up
Play me for a ho and Ima pull up with a gun up
Bitch, you see the chain, got me looking like the sun up
All that old fly shit will get a nigga done up
Believe that, I'm 1 up (x8)

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, H-Town, Money Gang, nigga ain't shit slow
Got the hood trippin, trunk sound like a kick, tho
Hustle Gang everythang, tell them niggas get dough
Young Tom posted at the skill tryna get blow
Nigga, fuck the club, I hit a lot and let a bitch know
Four hoes ain't enough, tell em get six mo'
Strap it up, let a bitch ride it like a '64
When I'm done, send em to they whip and tell em get go
Then I'm back, mobbin through the city like a black ghost
First jacker thinkin I'm dinner, I keep black toast
Young Truth, never sick of cheese, no lactose
Jump out on a hater front step, hit em that close

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 2: Lil Boss]
Yeah, I'm 1 up, on the block from sun down to sun up
Mobbin through the city, I would never put my gun up
Chalupa on tuck mode, yelling out fuck hoes
Got a bitch naked in the club like "fuck clothes"
These niggas fucked around and woke the beast up
Back to the pony tails, khaki's and creased up
HGC til the whole word freeze up
Hand out the window while I'm throwin my C's up
Yeah, blaze my motherfuckin weed up
Fuck the police til them hoes lift these up
I'm on one, 7.62's penetrate
Piss me off at the wrong time, I'll demonstrate

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I wake up, bake up, gotta get my cake up
Pussy feel good, look great without no make-up
Real nigga here, not a faker
I hate y'all, a boss nigga certified player
Niggas want beef, give it to em like a waiter
Shorty want the wood, so you know I had to stake her
Treat her like her maker, get a room treat it like Jamaica
Just one time, treat it like a favour
The VIP's on me, you down to smoke, I got a couple zips on me
Got diamonds on but I be doin shit low-key
Don't gotta make a call, my niggas with the shits
Cause real niggas don't slip, bitch

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yo, I'm 1 up, out here, still tryna come up
First you feel a burnin sensation, then you numb up
Act like you tryna hang and get hung up
Soon as you bang-bang, charges get brung up
Bring a nigga right to the register, get him rung up
Use to go see my connect and pick a ton up
Quickest way to get some respect, pick a gun up
And just start shooting whoever you in front of
Top 5 dead or alive, I'm just one of
One shot deal, one life, you get one love
All that old fly shit will get a nigga done up
Scoreboard clearly shows that I'm one up

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth][Trae talking]
I'd like to take this time out right now
To set the motherfuckin record straight
How the fuck somebody gonna tell my story for me?
If I ain't mistaken it's only one motherfuckin Trae around this bitch
What the fuck gives you the right to speak on my name
Like you know what fuck goin on with me nigga
Niggas don't know shit, same ol' gossip ass, messy ass shit
Nigga need to speak on your own self nigga, 2 each it's own
Probably shouldn't even give y'all niggas the time of day
But fuck it peep this...

[Verse 1]
Well off the bat let me expose the truth and the matter
It was never no easy task when I was climbin the ladder
But every time I hit the block the hood got somethin to say
Whether Houston on down to Austin they stay speakin on Trae
Shit they probably want me in jail cause I keep somethin to spray
I tryed to chill but they showed me that it ain't no other way
Me and my kin folk don't even get to smile that much
I guess everybody hate the fact that we be grindin so much
And I ain't mad cause I figured it was comin one day
I can't even trust no niggas or no woman today
I could've swore everybody said they was proud of a nigga
But act differant when they hit the other side and they clown on a nigga
But I ain't bothered unless a nigga really disrespectin
Then ain't no more talkin till they ass get taught a lesson
2 each it's own so why they wanna act like they know mine
They probably think that they know me cause they listen to my rhymes
Peep this I ain't get no love from nobody
Other rappers thought they was better we was broker then everybody
Only person who helped me and Ro was my nigga Roc
And all of my niggas that's still affilated from the block, non stop
Cause I got some niggas ridin my back
Until the Lord come back to get me I'll be guidin the pack
And it ain't hard cause every one of them is my family
Loyalty till the death and that's why niggas can't stand me

[Hook-Trae + Shyna]
Fuck what you thinkin niggas really don't know me
Still I keep singin get the fuck away from me
Fuck what you thinkin niggas really don't know me
Still I keep singin get the fuck away from me

[Shyna sings till end][Talking: 2Pac]
Yeah nigga, yeah – that’s right
Baby, that’s how we do it!

[Verse 1: Trae]
I’m back up in it once again and who that claimin' that throne?
Bitch I’m a asshole, tell them mothafuckers I’m home
Still kickin it on my own, feds tappin' my phone
I’m in the hood, livin' what these niggas rap in a song (fake ass)
I remind ‘em they dead wrong in the city I’m the king
And I can show you what it mean while I’m holdin’ this red beam
Niggas know the team, A.B.N and ain’t no doubt we touch ‘em all
Big, small, or tall, motto forever fuck 'em all
I heard 'em tell me that my attitude was out of line
I told 'em suck a dick and it’s best to stay the fuck out of mine
Just for that tell them hoe niggas, they ass is out of time
I got it on my mind so it’s understood who the fuck’ll shine
I’m comin’ ‘round the corner, lookin’ for a couple cats
Sittin' in the Hoop while my niggas sellin' a couple packs
Anybody can get it tell ‘em shoot me a couple stacks
They want the streets, I’ll show 'em where the fuck it’s at

[Chorus: Trae]
Talk to ‘em, I don’t know what the fuck these niggas is on
Homie against all odds
Tryna count me the fuck out. Nigga I am the motherfucking streets
Against all odds
They better get they mind right I’m back at it again
Homie against all odds
And I am (who you talkin’ ‘bout) Trae tha motherfuckin’ Truth
Against all odds

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Follow me, tell me if you feel me – I think niggas is tryna kill me
Picturin'pistols spittin hollow points till they drill me
Keepin'it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin steel
See niggas is false – sittin in court – turned snitches
They use to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I’m tryna be strong they sendin armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I’m trapped in the storm and fuck the world till I’m gone
Bitches be warned, word is bond, you’ll get torn
I’m bustin on Guilliani, he rubbin my niggas wrong
And then it’s on, before I leave picture me
I’m spittin at punk bitches – and hustlin to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don’t want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad – I said it
This Thug Life nigga we don’t cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred mothafuckers at yo do' – with 4-4’s
HahaHaha, Yeah nigga, Thug Life

[Chorus: Trae]

[Verse 3: Trae]
Tell ‘em if they lookin 4 me ain’t nothin changed, still posted up with a couple thugs
With a couple straps in my lap, holdin a couple slugs
I’m in a Chevrolet floatin on a couple dubs
Run up on me I’m a put 'em in ya chest like it’s nothin but love
I’m in the game but still I feel like I’m against 'em all
I’m in my zone, I lace 'em up and take it to the wall
I swear I’m a G – and I’m a be that way until I fall
The shit I’m on’ll have you prayin Jesus’ll answer ya call
Then it be known that I’m against all odds
I prophesize through the hood – in underneath all guards
Bitch I’m here to put the fire underneath all frauds
So any nigga in my way’ll be a mothafucker scarred
I’m the truth so reconize a livin legend in ya face
Before I catch a attitude and go to catch another case
I’m full speed, for the ride it ain’t gon'be another race
And if you think it’s somethin weak, then we can fall up out of place, motherfucker

[Chorus: Trae]

[Verse 4: Trae]
I’m on the edge feelin' like a nigga hard to kill
And fuck them niggas anyway cause they don’t keep it real
This mac eleven be enough to make a hater chill
Run up on me, I can show you how the fuck it feel
Fuck my foes and my use to be friends – I’m all good ‘long as I’m gettin my ends
Homie against all odds, I let 'em know it ain’t no need to pretend
So tell them niggas that I’m back at it again[Hook]
Yeah these niggas think I'm tripping, like I ain't on my game
Since I made it for the hood, niggas looking at me strange
But I don't pay attention, till they get inside my range
And when they see them thangs, then they know ain't nothing changed
They know it's A.B.N., from the diamonds on my chain
Swanging on 4's, with them diamonds in my ring
Now I got these niggas hating, cause they know I got the fame
Yeah nigga I'm the shit, Go on and put that on your brain

[Trae]
I'm ten seconds, from hopping out that mini-van
Haunted on something heavy, and sell to come cancel a couple minute plans
Try me nigga, I'll be the first to show you ain't nothing changed
Niggas see the fame, and they think I won't take it to they brain
Don't let the fact that I got money, determine a thang
Homie I'm the same, inside these streets I'm a permanent lane
I'm still in the hood, black whip black vest
Black ice eighty grand, with a couple black ticks
They wanna hate me, I'm gon help em to hate me today
Tell em hate these twenty inch swangas, under my Chevrolet
Now who gon play with Trae, and get me outside of my zone
I'll have these niggas draped in every color, outside of your home
I got a hundred sets, running with a hundred G's
With a couple hundred guns, loaded to put me at ease
Oh yeah I hear the talk, niggas say I'm tripping
Like I'm off my note, tell em come try me see if I'm tripping

[Hook - 2x]

[Hook]
Back in the day, motherfuckers said we would never
Be shit, but right now I bet they wanna see me doing bad
But I'm a G, and ain't quit until I'm reaching the top
And right now, we at the top and ain't no turning back

[Z-Ro]
Back in the days, it was hard to stack some ends
Nothing but young guerillas, kicking it sipping juice and gin
Trying to find a better way, to make dollas and cents
Packing my gat with a 50 pack and when the laws came, I would hit the fence
Catch me if you can but I'm more than a man, Z-Ro be a hustler
Trying to stack hundreds and fifty's, in a cluster
A buster I can never be that, Slow Loud And Bangin' in my deck
Nigga that's my go and get it music, because it helps me to get my check
Remember when motherfuckers, said Z-Ro you won't succeed
But I'm a millionaire, and I owe it all to the hatred I received
Can't forget about drank and weed, cause that's the key in my back
So fuck the world it's only Trae and Dougie D, me and my strap
Rest in peace to Robert Davis, Patrick Hawkins and Big Steve
I'm crazy chasing paper, till these haters come get me
Nigga we ain't the mafia, we be the Maab
And making motherfuckers hate us is our job, we ain't kids no mo'

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
I know the life I live be the reason for rhyme, even though it don't shine
Hard times running me out my mind, I pray to God that I will get my time
Did they hate me, cause I knew faithfully they'd remain to be shady
But I remain to do my thang, riding two deep with me and my lady
Jealousy and envy, made them cats wanna do me something bad
Like I was they enemy, and they wasn't feeling me but I'm still gon mash
To the top I won't stop, cause some of the people I know be a bitch
It won't be long for me to get rich, cause I'm a guerilla about to get pissed
Ever since 1999, I've been doing my thang repping this game
Trying to get change on top of change, stressing my brain trying to maintain
But I won't give up because I'm a soldier, whether or not they told you, these
Cats better get they act together, cause blocking the way'll get you ran over
Ain't no way I'ma let them stop me, cause we made the game and they copy
Perfected everyday struggling, now everybody wanna be like me
Aw naw, we ain't shining 24/7 I'ma keep on grinding
Drank to rap to bust a strap, and living the life while niggas trying

[Hook - 4x]I'm just sittin' back thinkin like
Who'da ever thought I'd be able
To create some so special
Everytime I sit and watch it man
Swear y'all remind me of me
My lil homies man

Look all praise out to the Father
When you in a life full of hate why
Bother
Seeds planted like farmers
Though I gotta be smarter for the
Ones that I birthed
Even when it darker
Even if it fade black
Ain't no need of a barber
I'ma deal wit it
They know they daddy real wit it
They still get a pridw
They still say this whatever the
Fine
Though soon enough get it with
Time
And to my little niggas
The one rockin my life than
Quicker than suicide
For love of everything don't tell
Em when I do the ride They all bliss I can't tell you what
They do inside
If  I don't make you well hidden loafer then my tribe
Won't lead most of they assume
Is what they mean to me
Just the thought of me bein dead
Was a dream to me
Lay everytime I look at her look
Lik a team to me
I'm only playin' they proud of
What they see in me

It's like
I'm just sittin in the studio vibin'
Right now
Ain't nuthin better
Lookin that whole videos of
Pictures
And there ain't nuthin better
My young little niggas never
Cease to amaze '
Ain't nuthin better
For real
Yeah, there ain't nuthin better

Conversatin' wit my brother
Bout how lil niggas kick it
Even it's bullshit it don't matter
Them niggas wit it
Used to stea; runnin this  game
We never quit it
Niggas still mean as hell don't you
Foget it
J finally made it to a team feelin
They fly
His mama still on his ass
He don't even comply
Probably some where on the
Phone hollerin' at lil chicks
Yeah the all in the mix
And I ain't mad at em
Baby need still
How did I train for days
I still can't believe TO'd and cut
Off his braids
Now you're lookin like a lil man
The happy feelin that I got you
Couldn't understand
I showed the world when they come
To family I'm dedicated
The position the real father
I was educated
Unconditional with the love
Never hesitated
If we ever separated I would be
Devastated

Sit there thinkin like
Ain't nuthin better
Damn
Now I need the babies I used to love
Man
And there ain't nuthin better
The crew they out there they're
Grown
Fly as hell
Ain't  nuthin better
They're too damn fly if you ask
Me
And ain't nuthin better

You know nothin my light that
Can give me the smile
Until I look at y'all Even though you're
G
You know I'm here to pick up the
Slack
And you the fold man
You ain't different at all
And I'm ridin through the town
Watchin Houston gettin grown
Every chance I get I try to get em
On the phone
What they got me goin through
With him is kinda wrong
That's why when we together we
Be in another zone
Only pray I get to see my kids
Graduate
Anything stoppin it'll prolly have
To wait
I'm tryna tighten up a bond that
They could break
I'm tryna keep her understandin' if
You went straight
I rather to you
I lay you before I float in the sky
And if I tell you somethin'
Different I'd be livin a lie
Everyone of y'all the biz
Little somethin' came by
Y'all the reason I was livin
I ain't ready to die

No lie
Ain't nuthin better
I gotta thank God everyday for
What He blessed me with
And there ain't nuthin better
Yeah, you know you the leader of
The pack man
Take care of your brothers
Ain't nuthin better
Baby, Nicole
Houston
I love you
And there ain't nuthin better
Ain't nuthin better
And there ain't nuthin better
Ain't nuthin better
And there ain't nuthin better(*singing*)

[Hook: Shyna - 2x]
I'm writing, a letter
I'm writing, writing a letter to my loved ones

[Trae]
Dear Dinkie, more it what happened everytime I think about you
It's like the world been on my shoulders, everyday I been without you
My way of living ain't healthy, but I'm trying to be a man
I swear to God I'm fin to lose my cool, and people don't understand
Cause they be coming at me with drama, not knowing I'm going through it
I've been running from suicide, but they pushing me to do it
My nigga I'm telling you, I be needing you by my side
But when I see Danny Boo face, I be knowing I gotta ride
Deep inside it's tearing me up, since I'm praying it'll be ok
I mash the gas a hundred percent, till we together one day
You got a nephew on the way, I forgot to tell you the news
That mean just one more part of us, that'll give them hoes the blues
Our baby brother Jay'Ton, been doing his thang
And since he the youngest, you know mama won't hesitate to complain
And it's the same old thang, one day I'm coming to get you
As long as I'm in these streets, I promise they'll never forget you

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
What's happening baby girl, it's been a long time
You know I'ma rep you forever, with every word coming out this hard time
Lori, I'm never gon forget the day that you died
I couldn't cry, but all the pain inside was killing my pride
I had to be strong, for the sake of Dinkie in his cell
I knew he would lose it, missing you is what put him through hell
Your unborn child, didn't even get to see the day
I never understood why, the Lord'll let em come take you away
And I turned out how you wanted me to be, somebody special
Made the Lord bless you, now you don't have to deal with this pressure
On earth I really miss you, reminiscing bout how we use to be
I was your brother, you was my sister for L-I-F-E
My mission ain't over, till the day that I get the nigga that did it
Whether living or dead, somebody he close to fin to feel it
And I mean it, cause he took one of my loved ones
Now I'm losing focus, writing a letter to my loved one

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
Brenda what happened, Donnie we gotta keep the Lord first
The paining is burst, got me visualizing us living life in the worst
Way, I try to smile but it be hard sometimes
Knowing that you facing murder, due to the fact these niggas be out of line
I can't explain life, but still I understand
Everything happened for a reason, just part of becoming a man
And I can't tell you how I feel, when I heard that your mama passed
Knowing the last time you seen her, was in visitation through glass
Lord knows keyendation, ain't need to be in your life
So I'ma mash it to the fullest, and make sure they iight
And every night I'm on my knees, to ask the Lord to help you out
Inside my mind without a doubt, I know he bout to let you out
But don't you lose faith, cause faith is important at this time
And I'm your dog to the end, no matter what I'ma be around
South Klique forever, through the sunny and rainy weather
I love you my nigga, that's the reason I'm writing this letter

[Hook - 2x]

(Shyna)
I'm missing you, I'm mis-sing you[Trae]
What up Mr. Dinkie how you feeling my nigga
Greetings from your next to be the K-I-N-G
It's been a second, but I hate the way that I'm feeling G
Still it's plain to see, I ain't been living the best I can
I ain't living the best of shit, cause I've been stressing and I really need a hand
Better yet fuck that, I need you by my side
So we can hop inside the M, and take a ride
Reminiscing on how we missed out, over the years together shed our tears together
Back to back without no fears together, ready to do whatever
I never knew that you would go, and learn to live a life of crime
I never knew that I would see Lorie, get buried in the ground
I prolly missed out on my childhood, living a harder life
Than most of these kids that never seen, the side of death up in they life
I know I never would of been rapping, if it wasn't for you
Started out in 12th, who'd ever thought that I'd be making it through
I bet to you it wasn't a soul, that had the faith we had up on eachother
So I love you to death, real conversation from your blood brother

[Hook: Billy Cook]
Life goes on, living my life and I'm riding in my zone
Dealing with pressure, but still I gotta be strong
Holding it down, until you come back home I feel all alone
Life goes on, living my life and I'm riding in my zone
Dealing with pressure, but still I gotta be strong
Holding it down, until you come back home see life goes on

[Trae]
I don't think they told ya, that I'm one of the best to do what I do
Holding you down everytime I rap, you know I'm repping for you
See I'm my brother's keeper, and it don't mean much to everybody else
To me it mean the world, and I don't give a fuck about nobody else
Tatted on my arm and on my hand, for me to show 'em the love
I'd even take a beating, if it's death then I'll be taking that slug
I remember watching you get your change, pulling up in that '98
On swangas on Fondren & Main, I barely knew a thang
But I was cool as fuck, everything that you did I tried to do the same
Now I only think about you, going through that pain
On that cell block, living in a jungle of gorillas
But I know they ass don't want it, cause they fucking with a killa
Sometimes I hit the cut, just to hear the G's talk about ya
How you brought it for the streets, and shit ain't been this far without ya
It hurt when I'm glancing at your picture, wishing you was here
But you left me all alone, to grab the wheel and try to steer

[Hook]

[Trae]
I be stomped, on my big brother and lil' brother talk
But I'ma be alright tonight's the night
That I decide to walk, hope that I don't get caught
I finally caught up with your daughter, even though they ass tried to hide her
Trying to say that she ain't yours, fuck that that bitch a liar
Danny Boo say that she is, me and Jay say that she is
Everything about her, plus looking at her face say that she is
Yeah I got the kite, anything that you want I got
Don't worry about the name, cause everything I'm on note to keep it hot
Whether or not they like it, just as long as they ass see it
Twenty thousand on my neck, to make sure they ass gotta read it
You my brother plus the youngest one
Seem to be taking your ways and bringing 'em back
Flyer than a motherfucker, swanging bags under the Lac
Ready to fight just like I am, you know that we got it from you
Plus our temper down the drain, nigga you know just how we do
We from the same mother, so you know we all look like we twins
You my heart, I'ma tell you over time and time again

[Hook]

(*Billy Cook*)
My life-my life-my life, I'm riding on my zone
I gotta be strong, that's why I'm holding it down
Until you come back home, see life goes on
Living my liiiiii-iiiiiii-iiiiife, feeling the pressure
Feeling the pressure yeeeeeah, oooh-oh-I-I[Verse 1: Kim]
Speak to the 5, built to destroy
I was placed in a situation that raised me, not a matter of choice
Although I wanna give up, gotta live for the fam
Gotta look out for all my niggas, yeah, gotta meet the demands
And the people who need a reason to wake, my soul I give to you before I meet the mans
I can see this wrist, now bigger than a slit wrist
Man, I sware I can't aford to slip up
Got my shoes tied, when the game's tied
Will I stay in neutral, will I hit clutch
These are questions I ask, if I'm the man to be
Standin the test of time, a testamint the type that'll test standards
Texin like Tony Danza, I'm livin free, so excuse my manners
Excuse my french, but fuck your standards
I don't live in it, I'm infinat
I don't have limmits, I don't flex, and I don't do gimics
I guess what I'm sayin, I say for myself, I say for my health
I'm facing my fears, simple alleviation to pain

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth]
This one here for my thugs, I finally made it out the mud
Sick of people seein this love
And they don't even know what that was
That's all that been on my mind
Why the fuck is everyone lying
Fuck you niggas up, with mine
I'm guessin I'm gettin older with time

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Gettin older, but still in my prime
Fuck it, I have a toast, I'm a voice of the struggle, those who feel it the most
Better the host, never brag, never boste
Gettin I'm holy, never leavin my post
Before my brother's homicide, the pain was never so close
Sometimes, I wish I could talk with him, his ghost
Maybe it was a wake-up call, no one tells me get more sleeping pills, another dose
Gettin this money, leave me alone
Before I have niggas pop up on you, just to pull up in something you ain't seen before
We learkin, watchin where you're standin, stay out or lane
Gotta feed my kids, so they kids grow
4 clips for this 4 4, just tryna go
Know what niggas thinkin, but I ain't no hoe
Survivin, until I'm sober
That's word to Pac, and all them hustlers
Never met him, but I wish I could've brought him something, alive
So we could fuck over the world, cookin and ridin
I go to the safe, while you niggas in hidin
Better feel what I spit, the truth on this shit, fuck nigga, get the fuck off my dick
I'm solid like bricks, I hit you where it can't be fixed
Once I start, I ain't goin end till you sleep in the ditch

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth]
This one here for my thugs, I finally made it out the mud
Sick of people seein this love
And they don't even know what that was
That's all that been on my mind

Fuck you niggas up, with mine
I'm guessin I'm gettin older with time[Intro: Trae Tha Truth]

All gold coup, gold chains on me
In the hood stunting with this change all on me
Nigga, feel like snow blow game like Sony
Don shot a bitch, leave her brains all on me
Louie got these racks on hostage trying to get out
Ceiling on my whip too cocky I made em sit out!
You can find me in the hood like I never been out
Johnny got a spot for a nigga, I’m bout to rent out
Diamonds in my grill, I got that work off in the locker
Fly across a hater with that all gold chopper
Haters on my dick I’d rather try to bumper
Green lighter light up like can’t stop ya
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

[Verse 2: Yung Quis]
Gold all in my watch, niggas be hatin so I ride with that Glock
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

Fresh out of Charlie I just sold the block
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
She pop the molly, she sweatin too
20 floors up, I got a great view, no Kevin Durant but my niggas shoot
One gold watch, it don’t look gold
That bitch iced out, that bitch look froze
Tippin on 6-10, black paint, black floors
Boss ain’t get em I’mma get em all trust me
Trace ain’t get em I’mma let the russle
Open the brick now I’m grinding
Open the brick now I’m grinding
For the hoes add dreams
Feed live, fetish too
Smoking mean, not keys
Kush bar for life and my niggas too
These niggas, they know
I saw that shit with my eyes closed
Strap up when I’m fuckin these hoes
I’m a boss so I might buy heels and clothes
Keys!

Big bank, all I do is get bank
Niggas hating on me but they bitch ain’t
So conceited, I don’t think my shit stank
400,000 dollars on a Mulsanne
Come and kick it with a west side nigga
Ain’t about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga
Boy you’re broke, you can’t even be a threat my nigga
When you’re talking to me say it with your chest little nigga
I pull up on your set and make a mess little nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O’s
Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, that’s the presi’ diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything
I said trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything

[Verse 5: Young Jeezy]
Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm

All gold scale, that’s my magic box
Got the soft, my nigga
Give me thirty minutes, I’ll be right witcha
Got the hard, my nigga
Let me whip this here I’ll get it right to ya
Goddamn, I’m turnt up

Goddamn, I’m fucked up
The streets dry as hell, this work high as fuck
She want white, boy, dudes take it easy man
Shit I’d pay less for a pair of Yeezy’s man
All I wanna know if I’mma bounce with her
Talking me to death like I’m a counselor
She popped a Molly I’m guessing
But if she throwing the pussy I’m catching
223 with a silencer
Gon’ rock that shit with the flyest fur
All gold like Montana (Tony)
Hoes all in my phantom (Rollies)

Gold all on my watch, so big it’s like a clock
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
This for all the DJ’s that got this on replay
I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate
Several bitches in every state
I’m in Miami with Wayne trying to skate, my family straight
Ayo, ho ’bout to hyperventilate, I owe her one, we did a 68
I say hoes, my nigga, them ain’t red bottoms, her bottom brown
I’m smoking strong, my nigga, I’m on loud, not Bobby Brown
That’s souf side up in here, I spell “souf” with a F
F stand for fuck y’all if you ain’t fucking with my set
Fuck with me and I’m busting, fuck with me and I’m busting
Every time you see me think about what it would be like if I ain’t do nothing
Damn right, I’m stunting, damn right, I’m styling
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too

See I’m on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
You need to mind your own business, it’s 2 Chainz and Trinidad (James)

Got score at your lights stakes a lane
Nigga nigga sunroof your brain
Claim that you drink but you can’t even hang
Only came cause a nigga got paid

Pop the zanny I’m stressin, woo, pop the molly I’m flexin, woo
Dre Beats my beats bang, biker jeans ball me
She suck me off till I’m all drained
Kick her out Lu Kang, (bitch)
Wide body need two lanes, got a five oh four bitch go to Tulane
Niggas think that I’m playing I ain’t saying it just to be saying it and nigga make your bed laying in..
Born sinner, make a nigga die for his dinner
Eyes of a tiger stone killer cold blooded when I (bah)
Fucking beast, goin’ ham gotta eat

[Bridge: Trae tha Truth]
Me against the world, got it from the bottom
Now I'm on my own shit, they wasn't on shit

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm giving 'em tec, 'til it knock the king of it back
Stable or something I'm not you better not think too attached
No feelings to catch, dreams get cut, better relax
No vacation, like get you packed ain't never teaching, it's fact
I was in a state of mind of somebody who prolly finna trip
I wanted a piece of a peace of mind' but it got up and dipped
Minus the whip I hope the bitch crazy she end where she deserve
Let you go to workin' my nerves, so you power minus the surgeon
In this demonstration of prayers, no words I'm spazzin'
Hear the kick in for the river and that's nothing you has been
For everything they ever done my heart colder than Aspen
While they wake up, I barely sleep overdosin' on aspirine
Sick of people stoppin' and knockin', but still they jock when it's poppin'
The type to work with his arm, they go to poppin' and rockin'
Right off in traffic I'm hoppin, that hatred up for adoption
'Bout to be relocated, play with me it can't be no option

[Hook: Price of Audio Push]
Me against the world but I still won't quit
Got it from the bottom so it's been a long trip
I had a lot of niggas, now I'm on my own shit
Had a few hoes but they wasn't on shit
They know I had a lot of wins, a couple L's
The money come, it never fails, they know it's all good
When the money gone, you see the real, they switching up
It never fails, but still it's all good

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Never ran from the opposition
Every opportunity I get to bomb, I'ma bomb on a pussy nigga
If you count pockets niggas better watch mine
Get money, get pussy, let my watch shine
Six figures for the show nigga
Get fifty for the after party and that's for the low nigga
You better hold them to your ho nigga
Fast money runnin' rappin' now she runnin' with a dope nigga
Two door rolls Royce nigga
Your man making payments, I just paid it off and gon paint it boy
Still text your old lady boy
She hit back everytime you land up in your lazy boy
Strip club, black bottle time to pour it up
Peep the weakness in the game I had to sew it up
Yeah, I had to sew it up
Get money, where you from nigga? Throw it up

[Hook: Price of Audio Push]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Me against the world that's apparent to me
Okay my momma she ain't wanna be a parent to me
So I'm standing on the corner smokin' marijuana
Tryna get the package out to Carolina
They ain't 'bout the dinosaurs in the dope game
Lookin' for the doors to the room full of cocaine
All I ever dreamed
Was a beamer and a girl of the cover of a magazine
Extended magazine
On a chopper and a Glock forty and a mini fourteen
Fully automatic, let the motherfucker have it
Bet they paralyze him if they missin' no bustin' cabbage
I'm from Atlanta the real one
The place where you ain't gotta start a culture, steal one
Yeah, from where you can be the man 'til you kill one
And a bird ain't shit, until you deal one
Bankroll Mafia

It's all hood nigga, motherfuckers must of forgot
We real niggas real life, around this bitch
Go through this shit everyday, ain't no motherfucking play thang
Niggas need to use they brain mayn
Coming from niggas, who been through that shit
Hey yo Redd, give 'em the game

[Yung Redd]
Ya already know, S-L-A-B
I'm at a loss for words, fuck you pay me
H.S.E., yeah the album coming
I got that Hemi in that Magnum humming, plus them Davin's running
Black on black, the ceiling pushed back
One grind at a time, mayn I can't look back
Stomach never got full, off hopes and dreams
So I keep my grands going, trying to save my green
March to my own tune, nigga do' rate me
Bread stacked to the ceiling, I'm so Yao Ming
Hit body ain't a gangsta, and that ain't you
Falsifying your hood stripes, nigga that ain't true
Naw street nigga, like I'm homeless
The reason why I tell niggas get on they grind, because I'm on it
Calm as a bitch, pray you don't get caught
Anybody with a strap, will make you hole that throat and that's real

[Hook - 2x]
Loose sips sink ships, better keep quiet
Late night in my hood, yeah them niggas riot
Car stopped, windows cracked hear them thangs firing
It's all hood nigga, it's all hood nigga

[Trae]
The hood done made me a man, and everyday I be running to save my life
And find myself right back to the block, where niggas be known to live it shife
And whether I'm rich or whether I'm broke, I still been blessed aside the trap
Where some of these niggas done lost they life, to put they name across the map
That's why I post up on the corner, watching all of my niggas surround us
Ready to spray a wave or something, that'll have all them niggas drowning
Guard your head homie, before you be dead homie
Plus them niggas you running with, might be working with the FED's homie
That's why I roll with my immediates, like we all that we got
You disrespect and watch how fast, these niggas open up shots
We in the light like kiss the daytime, trying to grind to get it on
These pussy niggas out of they league, but fuck that shit they out they zone
See that's the rules inside the gutter, they don't give a fuck about ya
They gon use ya till they can't, then they gon do the rest without ya
But I'm prepared to play it raw, and show they ass it's A.B.N
So yeah these niggas got me fucked, but I'ma let the games begin

[Hook - 2x][Hook: Brian Angel]
It's all that I know, it's all that I know

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Shit, what I do?
The bitches shuffle to the front when I come
Clap your hand & stomp your foot to the rhyme cougar
Roll the die hit the blunt
Listen to the rhythm of the rapper, ass whooper
I click-clack like a gat, spitter
Broke up with my rap, but I'm back with her
Don't fuck with my greens or
You don't want the Hulk to get mad nigga?!
Nigga, nigga, with a motherfucking man right here
Nigga nigga put his foot in your shit, or
Make a nigga slap in your ass, kisser
Let that nigga do the little song
Write it to the music, feel it work it
Soon as Trae e-mail me the beat
I'mma take it to the booth and I'mma kill it, murk it
Curse it, bless it, church it, cash it, change it, purse it
Tell them niggas that I'm back on the block
And I got them killer verses
Tell 'em to sell 'em the one for ten
I'd let them go, two for five
Either way, I'mma get that ten
Or you don't get none of these rhymes
Long as I murder these shows and hurdle these hoes
Shorty don't go and I don't have to be working that lows
I rock jewelry that glows with a rap name, twenty years old
Shit, what else can I say? Fuck, that's all that I know!

[Verse 2: Trae]
I am the street king, took a minute to lock shit
Money, bitches and gunplay, you ain't gon' block shit
Overdose in my hand, tell 'em I can't feel 'em
Diamonds all over my fingers, that'd be on Cîroc shit
I been livin' all player, ever since shit off
Haters on all my dick like women, they'd better get off
You can find me in the gutter, scared of heights
Sitting on a couple of mill, money tall I'm tryna get off
Clique like brothers, tell 'em to give 'em the blues
They recievin' the call of competition I won't lose
I'm a fool, when I lace these shoes with these tools
Leavin' niggas abused of something off in the crew
Speakin' of [?] crews, tell niggas ain't nothin' new
Used to kick it one thing, now hoes come in the two's
Run upon 'em like murder, should've been on the news
I shoot 'em in they face, they leave with no clues
All the way to the boulevard walkin' in all glass
Tell the bank-teller person I'll count it in all cash
Everybody be talkin' but I'mma pull up and show 'em somethin'
And go to wreckin' shit like I been in a bad crash
In the hood, I'm access for real
Ask [?], he'll tell you that I was Trill
Million dollar mouthpiece, one hell of a grill
I thug Universal, don't sweat it, I got a deal
Anybody wanna run up I'll tell 'em I'm in this bitch
If a hater got a problem I'm probably up in his bitch
You all want truth, you gon' find him up in a ditch
I'll bang his ass up like [?] when I'm makin' hits
You can tell 'em I'm sick, rare form of cancer
I am the truth, I guarantee you the answer
Anybody who lookin' tell 'em to look no more
If I don't get the proper respect, I'm kickin' they door

[Hook: Brian Angel]
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I be in the corner with the bitches
Off in the club I be grantin' many wishes
All the haters be super suspicious
As to why they sniffin' I make super digits
Makin' beautiful music and then a bita'
Aphrodisiac to get bitches to swoon
But I catch 'em quick with these incredible tunes
Me stickin' poon will be inevitable soon
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, I'll be laughin' at these busters
Think they smashin' and we suckers
But we blastin' at these fuckers
Trippin' over colors, you niggas, you gotta love us
No matter the set I'mma get up and rip 'em into pieces
He's beneath me and needs to be treated
Like a flea with a beast and believe he's heated
Because of my talent they mad
And I'm never gonna challenge their ass
'Cause my balance for nada pay cash
You suckers down there but my wallet say "Bad
Motherfucker" like Samuel L
You perpetrators I'mma damn you to hell
Your bitches love to hear this animal yell
Try to beat me, understand you will fail!
In control of all of my dough
Now it's off to the mall I go
You the money really tall I show
If you really wanna brawl I know
That you niggas gonna fall to my toes
I be killin' all of y'all when I blow
'Cause a nigga comin' raw when I flow is all that I know(*"The number you have reached" is repeated through out this song*)

[Verse 1-Trae]
Another phone call from my road dogg, locked up in the pen
And I can't wait till he get free so we can kick it again
Shoot him a couple shots so he can cap
Get kicked up out of visitation while he bringin our rap
What's the word, ain't too much it's still shife in the hood
But I'm a rep it anyway and hold it down like I should
I finally made it to the Source awards my nigga and repped for the H
I put it down and shut 'em up for those who slept on the H
I never thought that shit would be the way it is nowadays
See you locked and I'm free, and prayin I don't see ya grave
A little bird told me one of them boys tryed to set me up
Only way I'm givin in is if a nigga wet me up
But anyway what's the word on your parol
I know the waiting and the stress got you gettin on swoll
Convasary gotta credit so I know you still ballin
If you gotta get back at me I'll be waiting on ya callin'

[Hook-Dallas + Trae]
Some things have changed since you've been gone
The numbers still the same my nigga-I'll be waitin on ya ring my nigga
Some things have changed since you've been gone

[Verse 2-Trae]
Alot of time done went by, while you was stuck in a cell
5 plus bitch ass judge ain't make no bail
How you holdin my nigga I hate you got that many
Me and you was ride or die, you know I got your kid
My reputation still the same defintition of a hundred
Get a stage, and get a mic it's guarantee'd I'm a run it
Don't worry my nigga I stood around for the better-or for the worse
I'm kind of glad you on lock, instead of ridin in a hearse
I remember back [??]gettin on a nigga ass
Too of the youngest but still we gotta pass
Hop up under the wind, got [??] G-4 in the 'rest
That's why I rep it like I mean it when I'm holdin the West
I put a mark on ya name it's real nigga forever
And even if a nigga stressed you know I keep it together
And I can't wait to see a day when you get up over the walls
But for now I'm gon' be waiting on ya call


[Hook-Dallas + Trae]
Some things have changed since you've been gone
The numbers still the same my nigga-I'll be waitin on ya ring my nigga

        [Trae]
I'm a asshole nigga, and I'm running the pack
I advise that you clear the set, cause I'm about to attack
It's been a lot of niggas hating, on the shit that I'm bringing
But fuck what you talk, Guerilla niggas perfect with aiming
I'm bout to lean on the market, trying to leave me for dead
Cause all that hopping fire with Trae, will get your bitch ass bled
So everyday it be the same, it's just me and my dogs
Back then I couldn't focus, I was blinded by the fog
And Donnie I ain't forgot you, ain't a damn thang changed
It's SK to the death, I'm still repping the game
So I'ma ride for the team, when I fuck up the game, and now
The whole Spring Branch, fin to respect the name
And it hurt, when the judge said 1 to the 5
If they ever let you free, I hope I'll still be alive
Why these bitch ass niggas, wanna see me a goner
See I'ma swing from the heart, and slip they ass in a coma
They don't want it how I'ma give it, I mean what I say
And I say what I mean, they bout to see me strapped with a beam
And they don't wanna get it gangsta, we can go with the fists
And as soon as they drop the gun, I bet I get in they shit
I gotta tell it like it is, and I ain't holding back a thang
So if they ever hear the name, then bitch I guess I'll be to blame
Only thing I got to claim, is my balls and my word
Disrespect, and watch how niggas run your head to the curb
I'm a Mobster, looking for the worst of thangs
Retaliation is a must, for all my niggas in pain
Z-Ro, I tried to chill but they got me wired up
And all these niggas leaching your name, done got me fired up
These niggas ain't real, I swear to God that they hoes
Let's see how much they got to say, with a 4-4 to they nose
I'm bout to bring it to the face, when they fuck with the Maab
It's like we been against the world, since we left out the yard
And I don't trust, nan nigga Ro
The only reason they around, cause they know we gon blow
But everything will be revealed, in a matter of time
I'm constantly on a mission, until I'm laying em down
I only ask for the Lord, to forgive me for my sins
But everyday is the same thing, all over again
Shit done built up in my chest, so now I gotta let it free
Everybody and they mama, want me D-E-A-D
That's why my attitude done got me, with another reputation
But fuck jail, and tell the judge suck my dick fuck probation
I'm a soldier, and only for the streets I ride
You bitches got my brother every hour, with 3-65
Everything is coming soon, so get ready for the war
We gon come for the war, and I ain't leaving with a scar
Only way that I'ma leave, is if I'm in a pine box
And you gon know that it be real, when you hear the nine shots
Dear mama, I feel like your son is going for the edge
They should of never let me wake up, on the wrong side of the bed
And I got no understanding, cause this world is a trip
And I don't wanna be a victim, so I'm loading a clip
Ready to mash like a lunatic, with my mug on
And ain't no need for me to rest, cause I'm in a slug zone
It ain't no fairy tale my nigga, so don't try to be cool
You don't wanna get involved, with that A.B.N. dude[Hook:]
Ain't no sense to bitch about it
Cause you all know what's gone wrong
Late at night, when you're in your bed
The bad don't seem so wrong

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Tryin' to justify the violence, reconcile in silence
Dress it up in fancy clothes. Wash it down with diamonds
Drown it out with music. Act like they don't apply to you
Look how wobbly the rules is. You probly could improve if
You was in charge, maybe runnin' thangs
You was involved things would be different
Maybe you could make a difference
Or probably not and things would stay the same
And you go to sleep at night
Knowin things will never change
Wake up in the mornin and you feelin kinda strange
Don't remember last night, so you back at it again
Turn back up your music. Put back on your chains
Fasten on your watch and slide on all your rings
Put back on your glasses that block out all the pain
Hit yo niggas on the phone, and tell em that it's on (Tell em that it's on)

[Hook]
Ain't no sense to bitch about it
Cause you all know what's gone wrong
Late at night, when you're in your bed
The Bad Don't Seem So Wrong

[Verse 2: Trae]
Destined to be a winner. Tryin to pick up where the rest lose
Prayin to the Father, tryin' to figure out your next move
Pain across your face and still you wear it like your best shoes
But yet, you no accept it, cause it just might be your best news
Nothin taken for granted, still you searchin for an answer
Your fightin to be sane, your momma fightin with cancer
Father ain't around, so now you gotta be the man, now
Tomorrow ain't ever promised so you gotta take a stand now
Hard times seem to be the only thing you understand
Fuck seein a mil, you tryin to make it to a couple grand
Even with a couple grand, you gotta try to make it last
You ridin for the fam knowin the Devil tryin' to make ya crash
You gotta hold on, homie if you only knew
Never quit, knowin somebody doin' worse than you

[Hook]
Ain't no sense to bitch about it
Cause you all know what's gone wrong
Late at night, when you're in your bed
The Bad Don't Seem So Wrong

[Verse 3: Trae]
You on the only road to give up. Strugglin where your heart at
Though death is where you end up, they tell me that's where we start at
Either way, you gon make em remember you
Just pray you don't get stuck in homicide for that interview
You ended up in tears when all you wanted was a smile
(All the while) Lookin for hope you end up losin as a child
Realizin nothin helps to take the the pain away
Cause if it was somethin that numb away the feelinm
You'd pray to God to situate a day
It's hard to keep it. Stand up. You're leanin on your last leg
The pressure tryin' to weigh in. You just ran out your last bread
Window of opportunity feelin like it just shut more
They tell you to be thankful. Your response for em is "what for? "
It seem like everybody else in a better position
Only thing else left to do is open up your ears and listen

        [Hook: Young Jeezy (x2)]
You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
King of the streets, bitch cause I'm in that [?]
Julius Erving in the hood ask'em what they talking
If they don't tell ya I'm realest then them bitches hatin'
Trunk full of some call it [?] wonderland
Find me somewhere off in the traffic with this gun in hand
I'm tryna score like I was Kobe and Jason Terry
Hit the block and get a triple double of this Katy Perry
I'm going in tell I'm going not at all
Diamonds on my head stupid they ain't got it all
And if they did have it, I don't think they gave a fuck
Something like this F&NI'm holding nigga try your luck

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said “fuck it, buy another car”
Hopped out the Lamb’
Said “fuck it, bought another car”
I bought the Phantom just to say it’s black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
I’m getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
I’m ballin’ hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home
I’m on them Diddy’s, spendin’ Dirty Money
I’m on that Jizzle, spendin’ birdy money

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
These hoes call me Tunechi baby
Niggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating
Bitch, I’m balling, ballin’ like a motherfucker
12 gauge, bitch, I got a dozen of them
Nigga broke, acting like he got it though
I’m with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!
So many cars I’m like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house, get to poppin’ at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches don’t sell, we buy em back
Where the strippers, tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas I’m strapped like lingerie
I ain't trippin, I’m ballin, call me NBA
I-I ain't trippin, I’m ballin, call me NBA[Refrain]
Drinkin’ by the bar y’all
Bar y’all, oh my God
Drinkin’ by the bar y’all
Bar y’all, oh my God

[Verse]
Houston is pissed off
Still in the same lane
Diamonds be wildin’ out
I told ‘em to stay and hang
Look like I’m doing time
My neck in the chain gang
Everything fly as hell
Still on that same plane
Thinking about Booyor
That’s that Big Boo Yoo baby
Still represent the Click
Just movin’ solo baby
Thinking ‘bout where we been
Keep me from going crazy
Had the whole world leanin’
Motion to something lazy
No doubt about it
Thinking about you and Screw
And how we used to talk and blaze
Yellin’ “man, hol’ up”
Bald faded, versace shades
Tap, tappin’ on boys
Bring it back
That was word to H-A-W-K, 3-2, and Pat, nigga

[Refrain]

[Hook]
Tippin’ on these fools
Movin’ slow
Trunk never closed
Niggas know
I’m gon’ brimp the click
It’s all I know
Somewhere off in traffic, moving slow
And all I wore is riff, what’s goin’ on?
I’ve gotta hold it down
I can’t let go

[Bridge x2]
I tell the boys in blue
Imma stay screwed up
It’s gonna heal me from my wound up, wound up

[Refrain]

[Hook][Chorus: T.I.]
Stayin' alive sometimes hard work, today
You got a problem, go to God first and pray
That won't He do it, it could always be worse
Every day a good day, when He above the dirt
Another day, another bill that I have to pay
The weed man said he was five minutes away
And that was yesterday
But it could always be worse
Every day a good day when He above the dirt
[Verse 1: RaRa]
I had young thot givin' me top, sittin' in a hotbox
I was 14 years old workin' the Duwop
All eyes on me, nigga, thought I was 2Pac
Fucked the wrong young nigga' girl, I need two Glocks
Tryna' ride drop-top Ville, for the summertime
Young nigga put in work, I had a hundred grand
Lot of niggas pack up  leave, streetlights on
Where the fuck was I gon' go? I had no home
Asked my partner, "Can I come over? Sleep on the sofa?"
Had to get out  grandma crib, I'm no pushover
Treat a nigga like I'm a Orphan
Fussin & arguin
So I need everything that I own, don't do no bargain
Jumped up out the porch, and fell in love with drugs
It was what it was, of course, I'm just a thug
Had to skip them Boy's and Girls  find me a plug
I want big ol' diamonds, and minks, all the allures

[Chorus: T.I.]
Stayin' alive sometimes hard work, today
You got a problem, go to God first and pray
That won't He do it, it could always be worse
Every day a good day, when you above the dirt
Another day, another bill that I have to pay
The weed man said he was five minutes away
And that was yesterday
But it could always be worse
Every day a good day when you above the dirt
Remember that

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Day for day, dealin' with struggles, I'm nothing new to
Prayin' I could see somethin' better, only a few do
Dreams of pullin' up something foreign, I'm in a Who Do
Solo on the block sweatin' bullets, it's what I'm used to
Pride hit me, all in my feelings, lookin' at niggas win
"How the fuck the Truth gon' make it?"
I'm movin' 3 for 10's
Lookin' like I'm homeless and broke
I'm damn-near out of wind
Aggravated, caught me a robbery, headed to the pen
Feeling like my life hit bottom, it can't go no less
Lost my re-up runnin' from laws, like, "What the fuck next?"
Trappin full-time with work, but ain't got no checks
What the fuck do I got to show? Other than more stress
Older brother stuck in a cell, tellin' me give 'em hell
He ain't have the money for bail, I'm back to work the scale
Told me I should think about rappin'
I told him, "Time will tell"
For now lil bro was reppin' the block
So they would find the smell

[Chorus: T.I.]
Stayin' alive sometimes hard work, today
You got a problem, go to God first and pray
That won't He do it, it could always be worse
Every day a good day, when He above the dirt
Another day, another bill that I have to pay
The weed man said he was five minutes away
And that was yesterday
But it could always be worse
Every day a good day when you He the dirt
Remember that[Trae]
I know you haters better run, I'm coming for you
And everyday a nigga repping, and riding for Screw
I was keeping it in my chest, now I'm getting it out
I know you spectators in the game, better close your mouth
I got a lot of my time invested, up in this game
It's S.U.C. till I'm dead, ain't no need to explain
I'm in the Maab with guerillas, and we coming in packs
The only friends we got deep, and coming with black gats
So niggas'd back back, I'm a man dude with a attitude
And I'm too quick to click, Lil' Trae is a damn fool
In my zone leave me alone, I ain't trying to be fucked with
Everything that I got, is everything that I wanna roll with
Me and me and myself, you niggas bad for my health
Now I'm pumped up like Superman, with a uppercut to be felt
I ain't playing with what I'm saying, you cats better start praying
For Deebo commits to spraying, and everybody be staying

[Hook]
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make somebody slide, beware
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make these bustsas hot, beware

[Bun B]
I'm chilling in my 1's, chopping game on my celly
My iced out cross, hanging down to my belly
Got your lil mama, butt naked shake her jelly
I'mma put her on a tape, and play it back on the telly
Boys hate to love the street show, when we showing up
I give me back the same middle finger, they be throwing up
They can't afford the pints, by the case that we po'ing up
Young in the game, it's time to start growing up
Get you some hustle, get you some grind
Show me some muscle, show me some shine
Fuck trying to crime, off another nigga name
It's just a matter of time, 'fore I run you out the game
Because I can't believe the nerve, of these hoes
Trying to use my nigga Pimp name, for benefit shows
Fin to start kicking in do's, with the macks
Trying to let that shit pass, now I'm coming for your ass fool

[Hook]

[Trae]
It's the return of the mad rapper, industry nigga subtracter
That be greed up in the fists, that be clinched like a black panther
I'm sick and tired of you fakers, that try to twist up the game
So now you gotta see me, like the 84's that I swang
My Glock I cock and I aim, my name you fin to respect it
You let me off in your world, then I swear to God I'mma wreck it
You must of thought I forgot about you, acting sue a crowd'll watch you
I gotta get that up out you, your people gon be without you
On top of that, niggas be using my homie name
Saying the Screwed Up Click, so they can get them a little change
Hopping from dick to dick, and I ain't even gon say no name
I feel like I wanna click, so now you gon feel my pain
I'm Trae, and I ain't bar nan nigga in this drama
Or mama, I weave and I swang sending em through a trauma
They tell me to let em make it, but really I ain't the one
Them bitches did it, so now they gotta see me when I come

[Z-Ro]
Where the real niggas at, cause I can't find none
Everybody be talking shit, when they be packing they guns
Quick to shoot a motherfucker, to keep they face from sweating
But when the laws come the main ones snitching and telling
Be these ol' buster ass niggas, killing all in they music
Showing a four pound around town, but never gon use it
I'm registered by my gangsta, you barely touching me G
Now 50 got the audicity, to come and see me
Fuck it whoever wanna get some, can come and get dropped
I'm a grown man I don't get people sued, I get people shot
If you ain't shot, I wonder who gon be standing behind the trigga
Z-Ro the Crooked, cause ain't no love for none of these niggas
Straight Profit to Presidential, trying to scandalize my name
They can't sell records without me, that's a god damn shame
I ain't to blame, why these niggas ain't selling and losing weight
But I'm to blame, when I go off and get the bruising they face

[Hook]

(Z-Ro)
Make a nigga hot, yeeeah
Why you wanna hate me, S.U.C
You niggas can't be meeee
My nigga T-R-A-E
And that's the way it's gonna be
Until a motherfucker take me
Me, and the M double A-B
We gon be thugging
Until we see you niggas deceased

(*talking*)
Straight up, it's my cousin Trae nigga
These bitch ass niggas can't fuck with you

[Hook](*talking*)
Yeah, you must be a motherfucking fool
To think, we ain't staying on this underground shit
Trae the Truth nigga, Asshole By Nature
Slow Loud And motherfucking Bangin nigga
We bout to bring it, to your motherfucking ass
(it's like this and like that, and like this and uh
It's like this and like that, and like this and uh)
That's what it is, that's what I represent
I'm in your motherfucking hood, like the President

[Trae]
Mauri gators on my toes, so my kick game sick
You in anything less, you better put em up quick
See me balling through the hood, like I hit another lick
I had to tell em I'm the truth, all the rest riding dick
Niggas better get they grown man on, fucking with me
If they see a nigga strut, it ain't nothing less than a G
See I roam around the block, like I'm looking for a ho
Yeah I'm posted in the drop, on a nice amount of chrome
Boys got me wrong, I'm still king on the throne
Sponsored by the hood, so it's swangas when I roam
Sitting in my zone, with five on my waist
If they looking drop the top, so these haters see my face
I'm back with a bad attitude, niggas be acting gay
I'm bout to put em on they pussy, for fucking with Mr. Trae
I should of signed with Dr. Dre, cause I'm a A.W.A
A Asshole With a Attitude, bitch what you say
Jump up, boys'll get thrashed
Pop my trunk, when certified trash
On a nigga ass, I lean so fast
Fucking with the streets, you get broke like glass
Shit don't stop, I mob off top
Plus my lil' brother, just hit the cell block
My mind half gone, I dont hit another zone
I advise motherfuckers, leave me alone
Flipping my slab, gripping my grain
Missing Big H.A.W.K., so my trunk banging "Swang"
I do it for the hood, ain't shit gon change
Plus my wrist game, threw haters out of range
I use to be broke, now they say I look strange
Prolly cause my do's flying up, like planes
Nigga, Lil' Trae don't play no games
I'm a P-I-M-P, full speed through your dame
I'm loved by blue, and my niggas in the flame
These niggas better chill, I'm the Truth in the game
Leather cocaine, so you know it's white mayn
If you want me on a song, get the price right mayn
Keep yelling my name, I'll put it on your brain
I'm the leader of the gang, read the A.B.N. chain

(*talking*)
Yeah, boys got me fucked up mayn I got this
Matter fact, I ain't letting it go nowhere
This Trae the motherfucking Truth nigga, Lil' Boss

[Boss]
Slumping the corner in my coupe cocked, going up the block
Got it soft to rock, plus my shit hot
One hop straight to the street top, plus my beat knock
H.P.D.'s on a G's cock, nigga please stop
Got a ticket for throwing away a ticket, when they stopped me
Punching it is gold, on my old school Galoppi
Who gon block me, watch for the paparazzi who gon pop me
I'm posted with my switchbox, now who the fuck gon hop me
I try to keep it bread up, and handle niggas head up
They asked who put the slash in the block, them niggas said us
I'm hopping out the black Lac again, same black mack again
In the same, black backpack again
I'mma show ya, I'm a Hoover with a ruger
The hollow points I'm packing, might slide right through ya
Maneuver the scene, I'm in a all black Cougar
Straight face up in court, like a nigga never knew ya
Point blank to your face, before you scream halleluya
Got the fever of the flavor, so a nigga gotta do ya
Coming through your window, looking like McGyver to ya
Made plans for the mob, but it seems you dying sooner
So I stay's in your head, kinda like a mind tumor
'Fore a nigga rip off, like a out of line rumor
Bitch say she fucked Boss, but I never ran through ya
Bitch mad, cause her coochie hole smell like old tuna
I know this beat old, might sound old to ya
But it's picked out by Trae, Grey, Boss and the Junior
Certified gangsta, slash certified shooter
Plus the paint on the whip, like the water in laguna
I took another trip, to go and buy another puma
Threw her in a Chevrolet, and sent that bitch to the groomer

You rockin with one of the realest right now
Trae Tha motherfuckin Truth
A.B.N, Hustle Gang nigga

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Black glass when I'm hangin out with Mr. Cooper
Black all-stars, yea I keep a couple shooters
Ain't no rip off in this earth that move I can't maneuver
With 30 bricks off in the truck killin all hallelujah
King Truth, all gold niggas
Couple pointers on that big enough to hold Texas
I keep them choppas, you ain't get that message?
But I got insurance, bitch I'm ridin reckless
And I know you say the mice is nice, I just say I'm cooler
The way this bitch choosin her head you think I'm tryna school er
Shit I just tell er what it is, you niggas tryna fool er
Next year I'm tryna cop the city bitch I got the sewer
I threw swingers on a box Chevy
With a couple bangers and that box off in that box Chevy
My money right, get them haters ready
Now now look, it ain't no talkin, hold them niggas steady

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
I try to let you pussy niggas eat
It's time to put your pussy boys to sleep
Pussy niggas always wanna talk
I'm busy getting pussy like a fucking boss

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I smell a pussy from a block away
Lets shoot them pussies from a block away
They wanna see a nigga in a cage
Baby mama garnishing a nigga wage
I just went and got the Chevy sprayed
Pussy nigga wanna scratch a nigga paint
Pussy nigga wanna see you fall
You know to bring them choppers when you see me call
I tried to let them pussy niggas eat
It's time to make you pussy boys extinct
I took a quarter Key to Polk county
All my central Florida nigga straight 'bout it
Broke down and brick I'm back in Bartow
Belle Glade box Chevy on my car phone
J-Ville I went and bought a condo
Back to the crib where I get it by the car load

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I started with a box Chevy
Then I got the blue Lexus
My bitch stay down with me
So now she got the new Lexus

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I went and got my bitch her very own salon
Get her hair do every day do the fuck she want
I started in a box Chevy
Now my watch a buck eighty
I heard the same pussy niggas hatin'
The killers comin stay patient
I made a killing milkin Okeechobee
I'm talkin millions with that okey dokey
Pop a molly now that bitch sweatin'
Or is it just a nigga necklace?
I tried to let you pussy niggas eat
I pray that all you pussy boys decease

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I started with a box Chevy
Then I got the blue Lexus
My bitch stay down with me
So now she got the new Lexus

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
I try to let you pussy niggas eat
It's time to put your pussy boys to sleep
Pussy niggas always wanna talk
I'm busy getting pussy like a fucking boss

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I started with a box Chevy
Then I got the blue Lexus
My bitch stay down with me
So now she got the new Lexus

        [Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Nothin promised, no life contested
When you been through hell, you do your best to listen
Me and you might as well except it
You be charged, and I done been arested
God made me real, I'm tryna share his blessing
These niggsas suckers, tell me why you stressin
Tryna see why so much agression
Depression, I'd like to make a suggestion
Jump in the zone, with a nigga that's well respected
I think that could help you stay corrected
Annimosity is well detected
On point, that flexin shit, I protect it
I know the feelin, but I know it get loanly
See, I'm about it, while them niggas is phoney
Don't worry about it, while they fakin it, it's all me

[Chorus: Kim]
Sometimes, you just gotta break out the function
Show your greatness and genius, must do somethin
Live, live in the momant
Move to the wave of the motion
Everything mean somethin, you just gotta break out the function

[Verse 2: Kim]
What up, me and you bread and butter, both beat and battered
We independent, both depend on on each other, could've set the standard
We could be the standard
I could be the key, I could do it on my own
You needed ricky rounds, I went and bought them shots
So I bought ricky rounds, butter slabs
Walls in the seat, girls that see me shining
Cars to the side
Ask me if I wanna hit today, I say I got it, bae
No debating, I take baters over
I feel cause baby can't emote
Every feminist got game in m
No hesitation, girl, I'm tellin you somethin

[Chorus: Kim]
Sometimes, you just gotta break out the function
Show your greatness and genius, must do somethin
Live, live in the momant
Move to the wave of the motion
Everything mean somethin, you just gotta break out the function

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Let me give you this invitation, if I may
Still tryna pull up on you right away
If not, I do my best to stay up out the way
Bitch, you let me tg to work like this today
You know me for searchin, baby shoot me that title
I'm legendary, play the game like I'm Michael
Them others garbage, ain't no use to recicle
A gift from god, like I was straight out the bible
You were right, and there is no one like you
No point in judging, I'm the real portraier
Never will I traid you, only tryna fly you
Take you somewhere different, four-thousand miles
You was lookin for the way, why not fuck with Trae
When I hit it, you need to call today
You say to run it, so you can stay

[Chorus: Kim]
Sometimes, you just gotta break out the function
Show your greatness and genius, must do somethin
Live, live in the momant
Move to the wave of the motion
Everything mean somethin, you just gotta break out the function[Intro]
Nah I’m saying
What’s the motherfucking deal
DJ Screw on this motherfucker nah I'm saying
They gonna start this load up shit

[Verse 1]
Oh yea, so yea to another forty eight nigga
Street king can’t shit the cloud
Pulling up with the slob top reclining
Screwed up Texas like it's time you find them
Like the 4th of july t fly I blind them
Would working diamonds get some shining haters
In them feelings get them rewinding
Bitches after bitches I don’t mind them
Suicide the way they big I dime them
Trade the true but instead they have me flexing
I don’t give a fuck for your descressions
Say they mind bitch that ain’t no question
Top is up the bumper keep the risk up
Drapers will be damned I played jackers
Go to trips and bitched go to take you
Murder seen they still be up and pack you
Top that goes whacking and lumberjack you

[Hook]
Walls can’t break you
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator
Carbon walls can’t scrape her
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator
Carbon walls can’t scrape her
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator
Carbon walls can’t scrape her
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator

[Verse 2]
Hold up swingers now got me tipping
Now the world watching me everytime that I roll
This one is on my line I guess there is someone
Leaning from this shit we bold up
Don’t you get it twisted and in any given time
I hear them they gonna be load up
They be in for life and I bet we never be fold up
Domestic violence and now the trunk is beaten
Bitches opposite then when I roll I see no bitches
About the money when I eat I feel no bitches
All I do is duck a roaches see the rich money
Money how this money coming and I just shake
The block like every tropless homie yea this shit
The beauty talking grid and got me chasing make
Me feel like i’m running on the corner got it locked
Cause I ain’t gonna do shit like boss gotta bang
If you throw away bullets with no name on them
Then I hop back in the slab and I swing on them
Paint it in the hood let it rain on em hard cop to a
Coup make it change on them bread long got me
Through the range on them new case throwback
Looking strange on them

[Hook]
Walls can’t break you
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator[Intro]

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Troy A-V-E, straight out of NYC
I rep that BSB and yeah the streets feel me
I touch their heart when I speak
I'm touching women [?]
I'm touching money off keys
I'm touching boys like a priest
With the heat, [?] I'm in tour [?]
[?]
Fighting cases in this court
Some lost, but they really won
Cause shit, what they really done could get them triple life
Or the chair or [?] all in one
365 I am free and alive
I'm too blessed to be stressed, thank the Lord in my eyes
Can't forget my cerebral, on point like a needle
I know some niggas be haters and bitter bitches are evil
You see the Devil's a liar, [?]
My homie Trae is same
[?]

Jumped up early this morning
Take the right bitch to my choppa
Diamonds, sip like a patient
Somebody go get em a doctor
Pussy niggas be actin, somebody should give em an Oscar
How you a hater but so real?
I told em you niggas impostors
I woke up another day in this Bugatti
With something exotic, one hell of a body
Bitch I’m a G but this work is gon go
I’m invested in drug money like I was Gotti
Nigga know I’m blowin coke money, dope money
Same shit that they getting off the boat homey

‘Cause the bitch that you come with – got er broke for me

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]

200 dollars, I spent that on your bitch
Do me a model, put that on my list
Oh there he go in that foreign again
Killin the scene bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go home, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whippin some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsches
You pussies can't hardly afford it
4,200 my mortgage
Ballin on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Reppin my city I'm runnin my state
Give me a pistol then run with the K's
Niggas want beef then I visit ya place (Bang!)

Countin money, hourly trend
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, coppin' a Benz
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowing the check on they gear
Fall on some pussy then hop on the Lear
Strapped with them choppers back of the rear
Sak pase' them killers is here
Woke up early this morning, mind is tellin me money
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumor
Millionaire nigga no rumor
Livin my life off of tuna
Wanted with me I deliver the beef
Real niggas only enjoyin the feast
Pull up a seat, bon appétit
No Louboutins put that red on your sneaks (Bang!)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Photographs of dope boys, is all they taking
Finger prints on the Rolls Royce, is why they hatin'
Push a button on these broke boys, that's detonation
Walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she livin' carefree
That's why I hustle for half a key that's 12 G's
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League
Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on hundred mill
And what it is?
Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood, we hella Trill

Think it's a game, don't advise you put my name on wax
Gooniez shoot off them same lips that put my name on a track
While I just sit back and sing them lullabies (Rockabye baby)
Another pussy die
On the pill I got from Fat Mack strategizing for my empire
I'm a asshole by nature just like Trae Tha Truth it's spitting fire
And I'm not a lie
Want to put me under the test
Then grab the .357 the murder weapon just to let you niggas know I ain't flexin'
No shell casings to pick up so I ain't worried about you catching me
Was taught don't talk about shit so I ain't worried about a snitch
Now I can do like my big homies used to do
Just for the rush with automatics it's a house move don't forget to blast

Fuck with me that's where ya ass will go

But what about today

[Verse 1]
What about today i ain't worried about the next cuz it ain't here
Im gonna live my life for everything that it is and try not to shed no tears
Ain't no wishing upon a star cuz i can't see them from the hood
And even if i make it away it still ain't gon do me no good
My future remains to be, easy for me, it ain't one to see
Every where that i turn i can't escape reality
The preacher told me a darker past will take away the pain
But i ain't got too long to wait for 23 years its been the same
Now what about (yesterday) all i can do is pray
Cuz tomorrow ain't promising im paranoid with a k
I feel like im fading away and my eye stay too out of focus
So im living for today just incase you haven't noticed

[Hook] x2
But what about today

[Verse 2]
Every day i try to maintain and hope the worst dont come to get me
Today is all i can see and tomorrow don got me leary
A bad time, but im feeling my past times
And on top of my sad times im losing my damn mind
I ain't thinking about no (yesterday) and thats the truth
Every time im catchin a grip its like my life will knock me loose
Cuz all my pain explains the true still i try and keep it going
Today is what i can understand cuz everything is showin
It is what it is there ain't no mistakin hopin and dazing
This life i live with me is real it ain't nothin amazing
I take it like its my last and clear the rest out of my way
From yesterday and tomorrow and try to think about today

[Hook] x2
But what about today

[Verse 3]
I know that i got one life to live and i can't focus on a dream
The past don put me on my ass cuz everything ain't what it seem
Reminiscing give me the trip i tried to block it out
Cuz memories will be the reason suicide will take me out
This how one might be my last and i dont wan think about it
If its time for me to kno i ain't gon try to get up out it
Now days be so dramatic like my time be runnin thin
Everytime i feel its over hard times keep killin 'gain
Just like (yesterday) it hurt but i can take it
In the den below (??) my back riding ruff but i can shake it
Will i make it, ill never know cuz my future will never show
So im stuck on the day everything else im lettin go

[Hook] x2
But what about todayFell in love with a Cadillac - 2X
Trunk turn flip, like a acrobat

[Hook - 2X]
Broke up with my foreign car, and fell in love with a Cadillac - 3X
Trunk turn flip, like a acrobat

[Trae]
I woke up, thinking foreign car
But the Cadillac, got a nigga sitting in a daze
24's hittin switches, sitting sideways
Trae flipping through the hood, like I'm running through a maze
Find me trunk up, with the top back
One deep in the front, two freaks in the back
Haters mad at me, cause I'm MVP stats
Better give me fifty feet, cause I'm good with the gat
Good with the track, like I'm good with the hands
15's banging, like I'm battle of the bands
New Benz like send, they run up out of grand
And the trunk read Trae, so they know that I'm the man
Me Paul Wall, in a slab out of Texas
In a Cadillac, had to get rid of the Lexus
Rather be gangsta, tipping on something
With something in the clip, that'll get rid of the plexing

[Boss]
I fell in love, with my Coupe DeVille
It's on a switch, it's the truth for real
Scraping the back down, these Southwest streets
Got a few teeth in the grill, loose for real
Big pumps, two to the front one to the back
One wheel in the air, gliding like that
Three O-7, rebuilt without chrome
Hundred spoke Daytons, with the two prones
Next week, I'm in some'ing from the Lowrider book
I'mma show these motherfuckers, how a lowrider look
Hit a switch on Boss, will get your lowrider took
In '98, I use to be the lowrider crook
Fleetwoods, El-Dogs Sedan DeVilles
When I ride, always equipped with handy steel
Cocked up on three, and got em standing still
I'm in the attic, wondering when I'm gon land and chill

[Hook - 2X]

[Juicy J]
I'm never staying focused, always smoking
Presidential kushing, always choking
Nigga I drank up, all your purple
If I find out, that shit be potent
Mayn I get high, fuck that shit
Your baby mama out here, sucking my dick
I'mma make her pay me, that child support
I'm a pimp out here, trying to make it rich
If you really wanna get high, let me know
I'll tell C.B., let you hit that blow
We can ride in the Cadillac, way in the fucking back
Hitting all the spots, just hogging that ho
Then take a lot of freaks, to the Hotel room
System on blast, you can hear that boom
Mayn I'mma pop bout, two three X
And drop my drawas, and take this chewing

[DJ Paul]
See in that M-Town, we snort that blow
Turn around mayn, and whip our hoes
Take me big gulp, full of that drank
Now I'm high, don't know what to think
First I had em beating fast, now I got em knocking slow
Sniff a lil' mo' of this sip a lil' mo' of that, even down the middle whoa
Closed up my foreign do's, opened up my American do's
'72 Sedan DeVille, 84's and 20 inch vogues
Chandillere, hanging from the top
Fish tank, lit up in the glass box
But I had to put, the toy fish in it
Cause the real ones died, from the kick box bitch

[Hook - 2X]

[Jay'Ton]
Jay'Ton, pull up in a Lac cocked up
22 inch chrome, bags popped up
Diamonds in our mouth, cash stocked up
Ice game six, so the game locked up
9-4 Fleetwood, headlights on
Fifth let back, but the trunk moved on
Flying through the hood, with the six 12's on
Seal in the groove, super kush to the dome
19 in the game, only love for my Lac
Never loving a dame, swang to the left
When I'm hulling the frame, trying to take mine
You'll be hugging a stain, like I'm hugging the lane
Screw tape still on, drank in my cup
Everytime, that I roam
Roach ass hoes, still calling my phone
Representing for the South, H-Town is my home

[Trae]
I'm a 24 inch black, Fleetwood glider
Tipping the block, they love the way the drop sit wider
Lord knows haters mad, when the left fly by ya
Call it what you want, but the Lac stay way liver
Boppers all on my dick, with the trunk up
Beating up the Boulevard, with the beat pumped up
Hit a switch on the remote, the front jump up
Run up on the slab, roam that'll get you lumped up
Hopping out looking like do's, got threw on backwards
Throwed wardrobe, by my bed son of a bastard
When it come to Cadillacs, Trae got that mastered
And the game that I got, way flyer than NASA
Me and Three 6, representing for the drank sippers
Iced out grills, and the wood grain grippers
84 swangs, and the late night tippers
Riding for the hood, Cadillac tight whippers

[Paul Wall]
I got that candy red, with extra gloss
Heads turn, when they see me floss
Scooped up Trae, on a sunny day
Holla at Jay'Ton, and my boy Lil' Boss
Trunk to stay popping, and hoes stay bopping
Cause the swangas poking, and the blades stay chopping
Beat the case, but the FEDs still watching
In the Fed-Ex truck, right down the street plotting
Dropped the top, if the sun on shine
Sipping on some potent, puffing on pine
Slow Loud And Bangin', in a candy slab line
Down here in H-Town, it go down
Old school Chevies, and throwback Lacs
Swangas and vogues, with a trunk that crack
This how it goes, down here in the 3rd Coast
Houston Texas, at the bottom of the map baby

[Hook - 2X][Yung Quis:]
Five percent cruising through the city this a destiny*
Four then one in the hole I keep that bitch next to me
Focus on the rap game and nothing else
Haters speaking on my plug I got that bitch by myself
I'm a trapper, H-town representer
Put God's soul let me paint the perfect picture
D-boy swag snatchin something with the paper tags
My money coming out of paper bags
I smoke kush back to back I mean by the sip
ABN gang, love folks and crips
Swaggin on them fo's, I'm bout to drop the fifth
I pull a six in the one liter let's sip
I'm on another level from them haters
I'm talking gallery condo skyscrapers
My hustle right so shit I had to have it
That's why I'm a neuver issue through this traffic
[Brian Angel:]
Oh no, no, no, noooah...
Uh, you can't ban the truth
(Na no, na no no) [x2]
You can't ban the truth
(Na no, na no no) [x2]
You can't ban the truth
[Trae:]
Picture me thuggin, underneath the ghetto somewhere duck the weight
Livin for my niggas in the system somewhere tooked away
Station with a bitch whose intention is try'na fuck today
No love I only down her and tell her to get the fuck away
King of this fucked up shit they call the streets I'm unable to change
Hood attentions invested in this class of this foreign exchange
Glass houses is sorta 'nough for me to try to focus
Looking for haters with this cannon case you haven't noticed
Hard to reach I'm so far off inside the deepest cracks
I'm true Cobain suicide on the deepest tracks
I think I'm J Prince, I think I'm...
Ghetto legend picture me inside the same shoes
Thirty years still operating the same views
Robert Davis in the head holding these same screws
And when I go I hope they praise me with the same news
And leave these haters with the same blues
[Brian Angel:]
Oh no, no, no, noooah...
Uh, you can't ban the truth
(Na no, na no no) [x2]
You can't ban the truth[Intro]
Come on man, let's get it in
Shit, hold up

[Verse]
I feel live ain't fair from all I've been through
They say time can heal wounds and that's true
Now I'm dreaming, nights prayin' you come through
Knowing you up in heaven, where I'ma run to?
You be replaced, somethin' they can't do
Niggas want this spot knowin' they ain't you
We was a two man team but now it's just me
God got him an angel, I got one too
I remember that night, that's where it all changed
I hate I got that call, I should've been with you
But the fact I wasn't, I still blame myself
Probably still be here, wish I could switch with you
Your little kids gettin' grown now
Nephews fly as hell, tryna roll now
I guess I can't tell 'em shit, they on they own now
Lil motherfuckers always on the phone now
Junior junior a trip, he look just like you
Head first with drama, he fighting just like you
Pat and Corn the same, they rep just like you
Make me kick they ass, they thug just like you
Off the rip, they all gon' go for Trae
So many thoughts, I don't know what to say
Just know I got 'em and ain't no other way
I told you that at the graveyard the other day
Sometimes I hear your laugh when I'm home alone
Other people probably thinkin' that I'm tripped out
Gotta re-evaluate, crew fell apart
I forgot to tell you half them niggas dipped out
It ain't the same without you
Now I'm doing me, reppin' the name without you
Only got a handful left that's ridin'
Everybody else carried on without you, cold ain't it?
Bunch of niggas turned fuck shit, bold ain't it?
All this snake ass shit gettin' old, ain't it?
I ain't forgot when them people came and got Dog
Some of them niggas probably been the one who told, ain't it?
In the ghetto where the dreams get sold ain't it?
I don't even want to fuck around
Got me hurtin' 'cause you ain't around
Either way, 'til death know I'm still down
Jay Two gone too, make sure you keep him with you
Put him under your wing and show him what's right
The way they told me he died, I swear it wasn't right
It had us fucked up all day and all night
I feel like I'm losin' it, loyal to the death and niggas abusin' it
Ridin' blurry but somehow I keep cruisin' it
Life or death, I'm tryna keep me from choosin' it, gotta win
'Til the end you my brother
Lot of other niggas been undercover
Done played positions tryna get out the gutter
For love of bread, they give a fuck about brother
You and I know I got business to handle
You told me finish and I know that I got to
When they see me ain't no way they can't spot you
Dedicated to them niggas who shot you, they time comin'
Word to my babies, I miss you nigga
Know it hurt when I look at your picture
Mama still in tears, can't forget you
The preacher still demand I read through this scripture, amen

[Outro]
You know it's like
Shit ain't been the same since you been gone bro
Hurt or not, you know I gotta rip it mane
I still got the team on my back, it's ABN for life
Don't worry, you know your kids mine man
As well as I know mine yours
You know it's family over everything
I miss you my nigga, love[Produced By: J. Cole]

Trae tha Truth
Cole World

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Wonder what it's like, how a nigga kill a nigga on sight
Did he hesitate? Think about his life, think about his kids, think about his wife?
But that nigga heartless, group homes, nigga never had no fosters
Cause who taking home the little black kid, poor thing, his momma is a crackhead
So the state raised him, and the hate raised him
They clowned on him at school but he fronted like it ain't phased him
Shit, now it's about getting money cause these cool niggas think his shit is funny
Gotta have clothes, gotta have dough, hoes ain't checking unless you got plenty, now a nigga selling dope
Holding onto a little hope of a better life, huh, but that hope fades so quick
Cause he getting paid so quick
He be robbing niggas just to cop the shit the minimum wage won't get
Young niggas trapped, young niggas strapped, heart turned black, won't turn back

[Hook: Ink]
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Later days, dealing with mistakes
On this corner tryna catch another break
Fuck school, tell them he was coming late
Block dry, hear they praying something shake
Now everybody taking off his plate
Bill him what, half of that he have it late
His best friend by the yellow crates
Suicide, tears tryna hesitate
Only seventeen, damn, seventeen
Nightmares, opposite of heaven’s dream
Bout to thaw, he ain’t got the weather lean
Black mans, cooking more than he’s ever seen
White books, he ain’t talking education
Fuck what he facing, the stripes are registration
Losing his mind, won’t lose his reputation
Try him he busting without no hesitation
Damn, young nigga attitude, like fuck it
Still tryna make it out the bucket
Light feather all time low still
Tryna figure out how the fuck he finna duck it
He gotta ride it out before he crash
He on his hustle tryna get the cash
Can’t focus, shit’s spinning fast
Laws on him, hope he’s got his work stashed
Loud work, hope it don’t smell
Can’t afford to take another L
First class, no feeling
Fuck school he about to fail
It’s all him, he ain’t finna tell
He on his own, he ain’t finna bail
Either way, he on his way to jail
Shoulda chilled now he headed for a cell

[Hook: Ink]
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men

[Verse 3: Trae tha Truth]
Look, now we in the prison cell
No commissary, no mail
No phone calls, just time
Couple of years He gon’ pay it, no mind
On his way to parole hope it get it
Middle finger to the warden hope he get it
Niggas wanna take it there they know he make it
Fresh shakes take him to the mic he hit it
They gon’ catch bitch he on his way
Try to stop him and it’s gonna be on today
Solitary confinement every day
“Fuck ‘em all” only thing he know to say
Now it’s time up, he a free man
Gates open, thinking of another plan
Where he finna go, what he finna do
Finna be a couple those, he coming through
Then it’s back to the hood “S” on his chest
Fuck Super, that nigga stressed
He going through hell like he never blessed
Every day in pain, nothing less
Pills in, zoned out, right plan, wrong route
Opportunity present itself in the kitchen
Guarantee he shows what he’s ‘bout
Under pressure no slack
Fuck jail he ain’t going back
Only way you leaving is a box
And you can tell everyone that’s a fact
Had my back, on his pistol
Black clouds, black rain
To his head, where he aim
Feel the same now the bullet in his brain

[Hook: Ink]
Oh, don't recall all the tears, all along

I guess a bunch of niggas forgetting that I'm the man
Gon be problems if you get me to tripping, ya understand?
Nigga being way too fly, it's time to land

Look bitch, I've been on that street shit
I trip for real, I don't play ho
Bananna clip is extended
These Bullets go when I say so
Back in my zone and I'm throwed off
You must ain't heard, bitch I'm throwed off
I jump out and talk with this chopper
Talk back and get your head blown off
I'm in a Dope fiend Rental covered in black
Bad bitch never geek when I'm in the back
Asshole number one and that's a fact
Yellin out Fuck em all, bitch I'm back
Strapped up, black mask
In the hood, lights off
Waitin' on one of you ho niggas to get fly
Wrong nigga budge about to get the right loss
Gonna hit 'til I've called it quits
Want that business I get your fix
But don't forget you been on my dick
Something like lupus, look bitch I'm sick

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I'm so Machiavelli, I go straight 2 Pac up in this bitch
Quit playin' with these rap ass niggas, you got the shit
You only wait like the rest of these niggas, got reservations
You at the table and they waitin' to sit down – that's why they hatin'
You don't want your chain triple gold or life invaded
I ain't lyin' man it look like it came with black Impala
It's only lyin' if it's really like that, then nigga holla
2 fears, jizzle young rich and real so fuck who ought to
Got that big man, that boy 'bout that number 3 out this bit
Got the all wood handle look like a tree out this bitch
What you know about money? So sick, it need a doctor
Just so killing everything that he on, he like a chopper

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Gorilla team, straight like that – we got bananas
High yellow beam on his ass – I go bananas
AR 15 my nigga, yea I'm commando
You know every nigga 'round me is shootin' so what you playin' for?
Nigga put his hands on Gotti? That's a no go
You a plug comin front me them bricks, I be a no show
Club out that parking lot, it's like a gun range
Ain't never play no colors, I make the gun bang
Ye ain't never shot no pistols, you let your boys do it
All you do is ra-ra talk and I see straight through it
Yea I'm 'bout them choppers, holiday as if they bright life
Chopper they don't throw, let it ride cause they act right

I'm feeling like everythang relevant irrelevant nowadays
I thought I had a chance but now they showing me crime pays
The shit I'm living got me feeling like a old man
I been the H so where I'm fighting for my own man
They told me chill but this anger in my heart steel
My closes niggas turning on me like I'm cartwheel
I never played with disrespect nigga this score is real
If I was plexing and I still woulda fuck out'cha steal
I'm old school I never post up on this sneak shit
That's all in Houston you can miss me with that weak shit
Keep shooting undercover slugs dissing ass niggas
On the hood you bout to be some missing ass niggas
It don't take much to see these niggas out here fake as hell (fuck em)
All they ways goin have a nigga going straight to jail
I read these bitches like the numbers that's working the scale
And tell em being real ain't rated by the way ya sale
You looking for attention I'm about to make em famous
Soon as this shit get in the fan the pussy niggas blame us
I kept it loyal but these niggas loyal to theyself
I did it out of love they only did it for they wealth

[Chorus x2: Young Jeezy]
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
(So don't worry) bout these hoe niggas, been there before niggas
All they gotta do is ask I'm writing show niggas (ha ha)
Just to show niggas, that I can show niggas
What else I gotta say you seen my show nigga

And I ain't never been a hater I'm like 'Yo nigga! '
Who's hot who's not I'm like so nigga
See they just warming up I'm hot as coal nigga
Probably why I'm platinum never been a gold nigga
The only thang he ever sold was your soul nigga
And they don't want me getting open I might close niggas
They won't give me no expose I might expose niggas

[Chorus x2: Young Jeezy]

Coast to coast block to block, city to city and rock for rock
Coast to coast block to block, city to city and rock for rock
(hood to hood gang to gang, gangstas out here doing they thang
On they block trying to get they change, keeping them haters out they range)

[Diamond]
Hit niggas the realest, from west Tex to NY
Spit it, from Best I to C-H-I
For the motherfucking gangstas, and all them niggas with the throwbacks
Keeping these niggas up on they toes, till the do' stack
Lace tracks and I rope the block, and switch whips like a parking lot and then I park the drop
Pick up cash and mark the spot, and move do' like a armored truck
I got niggas that'll stash the dope, ese partnas that'll slash your throat
Get stashed in the back of a boat with a knife and slug in the back of your coat, if you brag or you boast
Moving from coast to coast block to block, city to city and rock for rock
We international drug smugglers, and give a fuck if you like it or not
Pyrex in a pot got the hood on lock, got the streets on blaze no sleep for days
The world in a daze and the fiends amazed, first one in line when the fiends get paid
Nigga how you think the crib look so damn laid, how you think I'm pushing a quarter to eight
I'm a jazzy bitch and I'm in love with the do', and every nigga I know in love with the dro
Some go for blow some pop X, bring me the cash don't take no checks
Pack my tech strap my vest, give it to you raw if a nigga want plex
Bet a bitch won't flex and cross me wrong, cause your girl got heat not just for the song
I'm a bitch to the bone international, ship weight all the way to the capital

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
They don't really wanna know, how the fuck I feel
Cause Trae, will put em back up in a zone
For the hood that I roam, I'll run up on a nigga like what it was
And dump, till I hit him with the chrome
They don't wanna get it on, cause I promise I'm raw with mine
Pocket full of stones, like a king that's underground
A.B.N. gang, so you haters move around
King of the streets, I'll put you up under mine
Get out of line, and I can show you who the Truth is
Everybody, wanna know about Trae
Get a clip for the K, in the back
For the work on the block, I can show a nigga crime pay
Better get up out the way, me and Diamond coming up right behind em
Pulling up in a slab, with fifth wheels reclining
Best not to try em, homie I can remind em
Fuck around with me, and I promise they'd never find em
They wanna doubt, but I prove a nigga wrong
Whoop niggas ass, like Shot whip zones
Rip niggas up, like I rip songs
In a black whip, with the top of it gone
You see, I'm Screwed Up Click for life
Fat Pat, and the H.A.W.K
Keke Po-Yo and the rest of the squad, some ride red some ride blue-grey
Who is the Truth that gotta be Trae, either way it go niggas know I don't play
Southwest be the only place I'ma stay, burner in reach wherever that I'ma lay
Coast to coast ghetto to ghetto, better know I'm a Asshole type fellow
Hit em from the jump till my hands say let go, Texas nigga and that I'ma let show

[Hook - 2x]

[Diamond]
Down with Trae to hit the tre with the yay, and they know we got it raw got em sitting sideways
Seats laid back with the boys in a daze, sip a lil' drank with a lil' bit of haze
Never leave the house without some'ing to blaze, got the hood sitting still like cars at fo' ways
My boy Big Dame can get it in fo' ways, I'm a D3 repper I do it to get paid
More work than old slaves so I hit the block with some'ing hot, anybody try to jack get popped with some'ing hot
I do it for the hood so you know it don't stop, from the H to the flats in the Lex or the drop
We hit a lot of blocks so the wrist stay icey, couldn't care less that the bops don't like me
Studio tonight so you know we getting icey, and this is where we going with the work you can find me

[Hook - 2x][Hook]
When I'm coming, round that corner
All you haters, better get up out of my range
Run up on me, if you wanna
I ain't gon play no games, at all when I'm taking my aim
Cause you gonna be a goner
You thinking of taking mine, late night when the 84's swang
I know you niggas in the game, gotta feel the same
Make a jacker feel the pain and he can charge it to the game

[Jim Jones]
I'm doing a buck on the loop, in the Porsche clean
I'm trying to cut in the coupe, with this tall thing
But fuck a bitch, trying to get it by all means
I'm on my shit, get a whiff of New York scene
If I meet the right mexican, get it for fourteen
And he got them bricks, I could get it across clean
And for the city, and fix 'em like morphine
Cop 'em when we rock the dice, and we get it like Rothstein
They know, I'm willing to risk it
On trial for possessions, still concealing the biscuit
Shouts to Trae, and my Dub's Southwest
And my fair Eastside, and all my Blood's out West
But my shorties down South, ain't got forty for a house
But they ride old schools, and put forty in they mouth
Mix Sprite with a deuce, sip the oil from the cup
All night we gon cruise, with big toys in the trucks
And we got our music screwed, like we crawling in a truck
Strip clubs make it rain, thunderstorm off of bucks

(*talking*)
You know, it's your boy Jones
For my nigga Trae, (Capo)

[Hook]

[Trae]
I stay strapped with the automatic, living the best of my situation
I come around the corner busting, and empty the clip with no hesitation
The shit that I be on, is what us niggas be living
Ain't nobody finna take up off mine, I give a fuck what these haters feeling
Out the Southwest, my reputation known to exceed itself
And 84's commits to turn, amongst the blocks that I bleed to death
They watching me, but my nature gotta be taking it's time
Cause I got a set of hands, similar to Roy Jones in his prime
And if needed, I got the Crips and Bloods and BD's
That'll click on pussy niggas, like I'm forced to click on c.d.'s
Don't think if it's a problem, bitch ass nigga you can see these
It's A.B.N., and if I rush the game it's gon be TD's
So be easy homie, I don't think you really wanna see me call that play out
Cause if I do somebody ass get layed out
And either way I'ma ride for mine and lie for mine, fuck it I'll die for mine
I keep it gangsta to the end, it ain't getting by with mine

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Shouts to the Dub-Southwest, ha
Shouts to the bloody 5th, R.I.P. my nigga D-Ray
E.T. I see you mo'fucker, ha-ha
You know, this some straight G'd up shit nigga
I'm in my second home, Houston nigga
It's hot here and we don't play fair, you know the rule
Come in peace or leave in pieces, fall back or fall back
We about that nigga, New York's rider man
One Eye Willie, Capo Status, Goonies
All over the world nigga, fifty state rebel
Ride with me and die with me, ghetto stand up
Rap version Che Guervero, but I'm realer than that
Get your ass capped, peeled back[Intro: Lil Boosie]
I'mma send this out to the motherfuckin' struggle I had nigga
Down on a note, I'm broke
Real talk

[Hook x2: Lil Boosie]
I used to be sittin' in a county jail
Who can I call on when it's goin' all wrong?
Ain't no one to call for help
Please God (help me help me help me)
I need help

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
30 days, 60 days in this motherfuckin' cage
No one to call on when it's going all wrong
Petty charges, weed charges, car charge
Man I need a lawyer
Dead in debt I money loan, plus I need a father
Cousin hurt me, took a loss where he can't help me neither
So I fall on the line, tearin' it down, thuggin' like it's legal
See quick my people and we at the same situation
A couple grand I'm bring 'em home but ain't nobody on
So we like fuck it, get our pen and our piece of paper
Juice it out like fuck it, it gon get greater later
Beat on the table, make the beat and put the rhyme on top
Wishin' the judge would show some love so we can grind the block
I hit my dog, I need some change up in comacery here
I'm a keep it real I need some shoes and some soups (I'm hungry)
Writtin' letters to my girl, hoping she don't meet a friend
Hoping she keep that pussy tight till nigga back again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae The Truth]
I'm in the state county, all time still awaiting my sentence
Day after day it's out the cell like it's [?]
My pride the business but my freedom got me sick
Ain't nothing live about drinking water on top of where these niggas shit
Inside the world I'm still a man but in here I'm a number
Called in collect but ain't nobody accepting this number
Screaming at my cellie, tell him catch me at the freeway
Hit the niggas from the block so we can get the latest street play
They call in Chao and they knowin' fool trash
I rather go in on a spread, I kick niggas across they ass
One of my childhood niggas just caught the chain for 30
Had a chance for an appeal but he fucked it from playing dirty
I seen it all, it's the same pussy niggas [?]
So I'm mindin' my own hopin' county release my ho
Go in the wreck, playing weights sweatin' and come home swole
Fuck off the week until Wednesday, waitin' on damage control

[Hook][Chorus]
A couple grand, price tag on your head - leave you layin where you stand
A couple grand, price tag on your head - on your head, on your head
A couple grand, price tag on your head - price tag on your head
A couple grand, price tag on your head - leave you layin where you stand

[Verse 1 - Yung Joc]
Watch him die slow, then his eyes roll (uhh)
In the back of his head, now his body cold (uhh)
A couple grand, a couple shots
Couple drip drops, now your leakin won't stop
Bitch I'm the man just ask Block
Shots rang out, you could hear 'em for a couple blocks (*gun firing*)
Bitch what's my name, call me Yung Joc
I got a great aim all I need is one shot
Everybody talkin in my nieghborhood (maaan)
I got great lawyers cause my paper good (yeah)
Leave your body riddled, wheezin and coughin
Here your body lye, box five in monica coffin
You fuck with mine, I'll cross ya life line
I'm a graffiti artist, paint chalk outlines
And the worst part (what it is) - is I'm not a coward
Visit your wait and give your momma dead flowers

[Chorus]

[Talking]
Yeah Joc I got this one for ya homie
Let me get at this bitch, Assholes By Nature

[Verse 2 - Trae]
I been sittin a second, but now I'm back for the drama
So tell that pussy nigga, he headed for trauma
You'd rather slap ya momma, 'fore you come fuckin with Trae
Homie I'm 'Tha Truth'and I get in that ass with no delay
Penitentaries, to cities, and ghettos I got it locked
I'm ABN go check the trunk (*schreeching tires*)I bet I'm fully stocked
I'm so deep in the streets - I started and ain't never gon'stop
And fuck a  (*reversed*)bitch, ya'll make sure ya'll rotate in the box
It ain't no greetin through the lines, I spitt it clear as day
Niggas gay, plus it's understood you get it - how you play
I call the shots around my way, I'm that nigga in charge
And fuck the talk, you better see me with an entourage

[Verse 3 - Yung Joc)
This is not a movie (cut) - no re runs
All sells final, no refunds
Once I make the payment, the hits out
I'm not Jeezy - I ain't swappin shit out (that's right)
First I tell 'em (what you tell 'em?) - where I want it done (where you want it?)
In the back yard, right in front of his son (*screaming*)
Then I tell 'em (what you tell 'em) - where to drop him off
In the Chattahoochie with his dick chopped off (damn)
Yeah it sounds harsh, but it's well deserved
Feed his ass to the sharks, for Our'dueuvres
No remorse, no pity
This could happen to you in New Joc City

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Lil'Boss]
Before the day I want this bitch knocked the fuck off the globe
While I'm posted inside my crib, in a Hoover blue robe
It's Lil'Boss, I send my villans to seek an elobe
Dumpin a few, makin these niggas hop fences like toads
Better practice what they be preechin when fuckin with me
I introduce yo'ass to hell when fuckin with me
I got some niggas that'll go do the job for free
You lose yo'life when tryna mob in the streets like me
Any action you niggas takin need to discipline
You bangin with a Hoover gang criminal, bitch you listenin (ya heard me)
Price tag on your head, rice bag for the lead
Bitch niggas gon'get it the right way, cause it's a code red

[Verse 5 - Jay'Ton]
I gotta couple grand for any nigga that want it
You shouldn't have started, now you done got me up on it
See I got niggas from the West, all the way to fifth ward
I'm Hoover crippin, I got Blood's and B.D's in my squad
It's Jay'Ton nigga and now I'm set trippin
It's A.B.N you better chill before you come up missin
They call me Tarzan bitch cause I run with guerillas
I'm certified my older brother Dinkie was a killer
I'm Slow Loud to the Bang, and I bang to the left
You violate me and I swear I'm gon'bang to the death (BOW)
And it's a damn shame, but I'm playin it dirty
I'm barely twenty, fuck nigga you damn near out ya thirties

[Verse 6 - Yung Joc]
I gotta couple killers, down in pre - trial
Put glass in your food, you shit - your guts leak out
The sheriff call your mother and she freak out (*crying*)
Got her hittin member up, got him on speed dial
Ooh it ain't nothin, but a call away
Come home find, your baby sister in the hallway
9 - 1 - 1, but it's too late
She lookin like a maxi pad, bleedin through the duct tape

[Chorus] - repeat 'til end[Hook]
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Another 48, nigga
Ride, ride every day
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
You ain't shit if you ain't screwed up
Ride, ride every day

[Verse 1]
I'mma come down, sittin' so heavy
Glass on the 4-6, shoes on the Chevy
Slidin' through the streets, [?] 'til it's over
Haters trynna witness, I ain't speakin' no Jehovah
'Nother hater trip, I got this top on me
And any time I come around I got they boppers on me
And I be flippin' like a motherfucka, get money
Tell 'em kiss me through the night, I still can make it Sunday
I got these diamonds in my mouth, what you wanna do?
Steal, bang, screw, come through
Some brand new, sicker than the flu
In the trap trynna throw his fears, trynna see this bread
On the low, trynna stay ahead, gangsta 'til I'm dead, nigga

[Hook]
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Ride, ride every day
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid
Ride, ride every day

[Verse 2]
Ridin' through the hood, still doin' mine
Mama say I'm fine, hustle 'til I shine
Bumper on recline, never make a sign
Left the trunk open and the top fallin' down
Ridin' every day, ho I don't play
Alphabet killa, hit 'em with the K
Fuck up out my way, nigga, I'm the truth
Word to mafio, bitch, deuce out the roof
Chickens in the coop, talkin' white bricks
Pull up with them sticks, talkin' shit to K [?]
Ridin' slow motion, incised leather
E'rry block flooded give a fuck about the weather
Water, nigga

[Hook]
Cradle 2 tha grave, told you one time gotsta, gotsta get paid

If you don’t want to loose your bitch you better come and get her
If she ain’t rocking with the team then i ain’t trying to fuck her
If she wasn't about the money then i wouldn't be with her

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]

Stay true from the truth
Got a hundred thousand dollars in the mother fucking coupe

Say the wrong thing and I’m leavin yo' ass missin

Every time I fuck, I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet, just like two midgets

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Who the fuck told them that Trae not the king of the streets, shit I rep like no other
Yea I get money like Diddy, but everything else by me came out the gutter
That's why I pull up with no ceilings like Weezy, yelling fuck a hater no rubber
Dare one of you pussies to run up on me, it be over put that on my mother
I-I am not backing down, hang up my chopper, no fucking round
Fucking with me, I'm a shut it down
Bullets come flying, no ducking down
Won't nothing be funny, I'm not a clown
Have killers and (jail) niggas touching down
Shut the fuck up, not a fucking sound
You no longer shit cause I'm back in town
Money so long, I ain't got a fucking limit
Haters get brushed, name shit (shouldn't been in it)
Hoes ain't shit, give em' back like they rented
Trusain bolt, every night I run up in it
Everything black, presidential lose city
Niggas can't see me like a young nigga tinted
Home town temple, for the crown I'll win it
Stay on point, other niggas can't pin it

Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?

No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab

[Hook: Young Thug]

Every time I come out I ain’t never with no new bitches
These bitches is stealing, I'mma sue bitches
Dripping down his dick, this pussy too vicious
Every time I fuck him I say "Whose is it?"
Who the fuck tell 'em that they was like Nicki? Oh no, bitches didn't!
I'mma give bitches a minute of shine then I'll tell 'em good riddance
To raise a child, it might take a village
But I wouldn't know cause these bitches my sons; yes, they was, and they still is
Gave him the kitten, now that nigga smitten
Told him to hop in my foreign and then I said "No, I'm just kiddin'!"
Hell of a livin', you bitches on chitlins
When I come out of my mansion I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons
Bitches is lyin', they lyin', they lyin', they lie in they bio
So I ain't fuckin' with chickens unless I got pico de gallo
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal?
Tell Justin Timberlake that I am comin for Jessica Biel
Bitch I'm a star-rah, you niggas, I holla tomarrah
Doors go up cause I am too rich to cop a Gallardo
No regular doors, on Aventadors
Painted it pink just so I could take pictures while you rented yours
Hell of a ticket, hell of a price
I want it, I get it, I wire the money, I never think twice
I am not gay, but lesbi precise
Cause if she pretty, then watch it cause I'mma be fuckin' ya wife

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Ok, cool, ok, bu, I love her

Foreign car outside, that bitch got 2 digits
Money stand like 8ft, just like 2 midgets
So shawty gonna trippin get some new chicks
Let me tell you what I did
And I bought a new whip
Filled it with some cute, bitches
While they was on IG, taking a new pic
I was in the bushes in the Valentine day
With a K, tryna shoot Cupid
Think im playing, for the cab 50 bands
And whateva's stacked in that Minnie Van
You pro'ly can't relate to what I'm saying, yall niggas
Talking up foul
I do some shit you pro'ly neva did in yo life
Well I don't talk about it
Trust me now, nigga, cause you ain't 'bout that life
Hustle Gang nigga, got a pro'lem with that?
Bring the motherfucking mob and the pro'lem begins
If you ever leave from me, ain't no circling back
I bet your bitch hang up the phone, you be callin' her back
Go hard as a mother fucker
Getting head from a couple broads in this motherfucka
Ain't no more fuckin credit cards in this motherfucka
Bank Roll count 50 large in this motherfuckaWho be as awsome
Lust[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Where we go from here, if I leave the block
A little money fine but I need a lot
Take a preachers route but dont lie to people
I ain't never seen anything in the sky
Clean in the ride, what I mean that I'm fly
With a bitch super mean, bumpin' lean to the side
I was thinkin bout any means I could try
I believe in a high!
Being logical gave me a reason to doubt
Scheme for things I was dreaming
In a magazine article reading about
Face card, I ain't got to pay for drugs
It comes free with the artificial love
Could I just do me, let me be me
I ain't arguin' for much
I'm with this bitch and I feel free
She don't demand of me for much
My sex drive been at an all time low
I can barley get it up!
Tryin' to keep another mother fucker happy
Swear I'm givin' up!
Drug usage is increasing since the last time
Been gone awhile and I'll be back just like the last time
Racks on me, stacks on me, travel hard
One nation under God!
In the car alone, prayin' to the stars
Engine roaring, make a joyful noise
Praise be to Allah, come this far or not!
Cocaine, Foreign car, look who takin' off!
Throwin' money at my nigga
Younger sister really wishin' he was with us
But look who takin' off!
Band for you to keep, love I'm finna leave
So I guess I'm taking off!
Good hearted if you think wrong
How could you be right?
Four niggas fuckin' the same bitch
She pop up pregnant this can't be life
Get rid of the bitch, 'fore I get rid of you bitch
I'm sick of you bitch
No hands on ya, rubberbands on ya, I ain't talkin' like a stripper
Pay! They do it, send razors through, spray the kay and make you flip
Only reason I ain't kill your mother
Strength of her daughter
And she cheats everyday on your daddy
Tryin' to give orders
Then they try to extort a gangsta, I'm someone important
Don't step in my office, I ain't about no talkin'
Be sippin' my coffee while bullets is sparkin'
Without any caution, now watch who I'm crossin'
Boobie is awesome, can't jump if I lost ya
With this I went off
My grandpa a gangsta, he died I went off
Don't interrupt me while I am recordin'
Shit so depressing, I wish I could pause it
Misunderstand it, put that in a coffin'
Back to the margin, re-up and get off it
Label an orphan, lane of my own
I got the hawkin, I am retarded
Know there's a name, don't know what to call it

[Verse 2: Trae]
Yeah
Its like sometimes when I sit by myself
I honestly can say everybody can't relate
That's why I talk to my angel
I'm in the dark looking for a peace of mind
I need guidance Father can't see the signs
Like nothing real the word redefined
Knowing the game is different streets redesigned
Still thuggin but dont wanna catch a piece of time
Knowing that love might get you when its lookin for shine
So many young niggas lost they vision is blind
Now I'm sick as fuck got pain beatin me down
Swear a nigga sick of losing where the fuck is the wind at
I gotta fight harder where the fuck is my wind at
Lookin at the road, damn where the fuck is the end at
All I know is be the truth swear nobody will bend that
All I know is loyalty I don't know how to pretend that
You did a nigga dirty how the fuck I'ma amend that
You said you was alone so I stepped to the plate
When shit got hard for me ain't no help get sent back
Bet, everything that go up come down
Word to everyone one of my niggas that was gunned down
At night I talk to God, ain't get back one sound
Its hard to see light comin out when the sun down
Runnin, I dont even know where I'm headed
I did it all for the streets all I got was the credit
If I can go back I'll tell my nigga to edit
Until im runnin out of time get the clock then set it
Sluts lust hopin they might trap shit
All cause I rap, now I hate this rap shit
Laws comin ain't no time to react shit
Judge wanna convict me I ain't even much clap shit
Born sinner cause I was lookin for dinner
Tryin to feed my kids tell em daddy a soldier
Lord knows I need em kind hard to function
Gettin sick of the devil that bitch ridin my shoulder
Fresh out my luck somethin short of a clover
Stress recycle shit over and over
Fuck the world these days shit colder
Friends fake but all I want is to get older
Feelin the pressure like everyone watching
The bell keep on ringing like somethin that boxin
My son havin seizures no doctor can stop em
Hold on to him with all i got I can't drop him
My spirit been broke I pray somebody swap him
My heart feelin pain like if somebody shot him
My brother keep callin I tell him I got him
And since nothin promised I'm goin without em
My aunty just died I can't cry I just kissed her
Short of my visit they told me I missed her
Look up to God hopin heaven can list her
Somewhere in his kingdom with both of my sisters
So in my zone nigga fuck if I'm trippin
My testimony somethin niggas should listen
Been 32 years but I'm still on that mission
The struggle got a nigga hooked like I'm fishing...[Hook: Billy Cook]
The days of my life, the struggle I'm going through
Cause times are too hard, but I gotta make it through
The ghetto of my life, the struggle it ain't right
But I gotta move on, and strapped with my chrome
Cause I feel like they coming for me, but I'mma keep holding on
A guerilla going out like a soldier, that's mobbing till it's over

[Trae]
So many times I'm ready to run the deal, I can't cause it ain't in me
All the hatred people show us, what got me strapped down
With a semi-automatic, living drastic
So don't you get too close to me, cause I might blast it
And paint another scenery, nigga this is what they made me
Live in your face, a bonified poverty strucken nigga out of place
That was praying to get a chance, but a chance wasn't given to me
The only thing I was given was pain, that I could spit over beats
So guerilla on his last leg, watching time fly by
Over and over and deep inside, forever wonder why
Trae never get no chance to be like Mike, or to live like Mike
Or told, that I'mma be alright
I have no life, and that's why I be mobbing and bleeding blocks
Corner to corner, bended tinted up and away from cops
Grinding and hopefully, one day I can live stress free
So everyday I pray the Lord, will come and bless me

[Hook: Billy Cook]

[Trae]
Got so many tears running down my face, when times got hard
And feel the pain deep inside, when my heart got scarred
And I know, that it ain't nothing that I wanna be feeling
I've been praying for twelve years, and never seemed to be healing
That's why I smile upside down, till then everybody move around
Cause I don't wanna click on everybody, why hatred holding me down
It's been hell living, it's Trae I display nothing but hurt
Everything I lived and I seen, is what's sending me to the dirt
My first born on the way, will I see it I can't say
My baby mama say I'm zoning too much, and don't wanna stay
But it's ok I made it through, and I lost everyone else
The only thing that's in my life, that I ain't missing is death
Cause everything I loved got took away, and ain't coming back
The only thing I got is me, and it's killing me that's a fact
But I'mma be alright, long as I'm staying strong
Gotta play the cards I was dealt, even though this world ain't my home

[Hook: Billy Cook]

[Trae]
So you wanna hate me now
Them niggas, try to take me out
I ain't never did them, no wrong
These motherfuckers, better leave me alone
My life, is all I have
And I don't care, I'm in love with that
Deep down, I know I really gotta be strong
And if they run up too quick, they gon meet my chrome

Because this world ain't promised to me
The life that I'm living, is for the day
And the pain I forever feel, is what got me running a stray
And I don't want much, but it never fell
I can't even get a piece of a piece of mind, without going through hell
Hard times is what I bleed, a blessing is what I need
So I can get over the struggle, and make it for my seed
These days on the line, and I feel like I'm next to leave
And I hope I'm going to heaven, aside if I believe

[Hook: Billy Cook]

(Billy Cook)
Yeeeah, the days of my liiiiiife
The struggle I'm going through, feeeel meeeeee
Tell em Trae, when times get hard
We gotta keep our head up, and gotta move on through
Make it on through, the ghetto the ghetto of my life
The struggle, it ain't rightCall my name (Hey)
So sweet and plain
But now you're gone and the
Pain comes back again
And I find

Same flame
Tell'em they be in but leave the
Same game
All these dayz I prayed I'd get a
Fair shot

Fair block
Hustle there all my life can't get a
Fair spot
Off the top they time off like rare
Clocks

Over the years, it's been a cycle that I'm glad that it was
Cause all my niggas I was down with, kept it real with the love
Before I go, I gotta say what's on my mind
If it wasn't for a lot of y'all, I'd prolly lose my mind
I look back when it started, and how it ended up to be
I'm feeling Pac, you ain't never had a friend like me
But then again, I ain't never had a friend like y'all
So I'ma ride or die for life, no matter what time or the cause
And even though my brother gone, I still got a couple mo'
That I live and represent fo', even though it never show
Like my older brother Robert, and my brother Dub G
I had to let you know what you mean to me, 'fore I rest in peace
And I ain't saying I'ma die and all that, but I feel like my time coming
If I got it and you want it, you never gon want for nothing
To my lil' brother Mikey, I know I be gone a lot
But look here bro, I'm a rider and ain't no way I can stop
Just know that if you need me, I ain't hard to find
And to my brother Jay'Ton, you the next up in line
And everyone of us unique, so you'll get blessed with the shine
And thanks to ma, me you and Dinkie been raw with the rhyme

[Hook]
If it's time for me to go, I know my family need to know how I feel
I dedicate, this motherfucker to you
I never told you face to face, but I appreciate you keeping it real
I dedicate, this motherfucker to you
Through all the drama that I see, y'all be the only ones that's keeping me strong
I dedicate, this motherfucker to you
I'm in a zone fighting tears through the night, that's why I wrote you this song
I dedicate, this motherfucker to you

[Trae]
A lot of niggas in the game played it shife, so it was hard for me to tell
Which one of my niggas'd catch me, if I fell
To the best of my knowledge, I got some niggas that'll ride for the house
And fuck the world, if they want it we gon ride for the house
Like BJ, K, Shep and Chris and lil' bad ass Bam
Shock T and Raw C, and all the SK fam'
Yeah 311 on lock, but he gon be home in a minute
And on the Blood's that he repping, it's gon be on in a minute
M-Bleek, T-Skimmins, Rick gave him a seel
I appreciate you, keeping it real
Dubs up, and ain't nobody have to take me under they wing
When they supported me, for doing my thing
Real recognize real, around here
Cause don't too many niggas, keep it real around here
I had a few niggas, that I met up in the game who embraced the guerilla
Told me keep my head high, and keep on chasing that scrilla
D-Bo, they say we ain't like we use to be
We came up from the jump, so folk we back like we use to be
Way before, 'an one of these niggas even knew our name
And we was broke, with dirty jeans in the game
Don Juan you already know my nigga, it's whatever you need
And on my life, it go the same for your seed
And even to my niggas locked up and gone, but they hoping they missed
I'ma rep it for you, just like this
All the way to Chow-How, we gon bang the cell
Fuck the C.O. for y'all, we gon bring them hoes hell
I really gotta put my heart out, to the family of Screw
Pat, Mafio and Gator and the rest of the crew
Can't forget about Duke, Big Mello and the kids that died
Without a warning, it's for you I'ma ride
And everything a nigga say 'cross this track, is the truth being said
Without my people, I would rather be dead

[Hook]

[Trae]
Nothing ever lasts forever, they said it could but I know that it ain't
I feel its time, for me to say what I think
So to my old man Frasier, fuck the pride you my nigga for life
Without you and Debra Hughes, I know I wouldn't of been right
Without Beverly and my auntie, and the rest of my cousins
I had to let the world know, that I love em
To my motherfucking roll dogs, Boss and Ro
Even if we wasn't kin, you know the love would show
I know these motherfuckers, wanna see me losing my mind
But now I'm laughing at these motherfuckers, hating our shine
We got our weight up, Frost and Lil' B, Rock and Lil' T
Doug send me or nothing, frighten Louis and Grey D
Mario, and the rest of my people that's down to ride
For Brisha, all the way back into the Southside
T.O. you mean a lot, because you gave me my son
Just know I'm down, when it's all said and done
I know it's still a few niggas, that I ain't get to mention
Dog I ain't gon play myself, you know I'm peeping the tension
Anyways, I guess I'm back to the subject at hand
I'm still S.U.C., so I'ma ride for it man
And to my niggas who I use to hit the streets with, except for a few
I dedicate, this motherfucker to you
And to my people who I ever gave faith, helping to make it on through
I dedicate, this motherfucker to you

I deciate, this motherfucker to you - 4X[Hook: Trinidad Jame$]
I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I am nothing like niggas, I do not fuck with these niggas
These niggas be worse than these bitches
And bitches ain't shit, only thing that they good for is they mouth when they talk to my dick
I'm a certified nigga, reputation solid nigga, come check out the stripes
Check out the whip nigga, check out the pipes
My trunk beat the block nigga, check out the fight
Exclusively fly nigga, check out the flights
Haters back up or get checked out your life
Play with me once, fuck it checking them twice
Got your ass burnt, bullets hotter than spice nigga
I got a engine with a horse in it, (beach) house with a Porsche in it
I stunt hard no force in it, both of my wrists say I'm fortunate
Might hit her with the fork, 2 Chainz
Streets say a nigga hot, new flames
84's anaconda, new things
These hoes get laced, shoe strings
Yes I am the truth, this is the year of the truth
Trae on his way to win
I got the juice, you niggas no use with that bullshit
Nigga don't try again

[Hook: Trinidad Jame$]
I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal[Intro - 2x]
Fall off in the club, let's get it popping
I'mma drank Patrone, till the do's go to locking
Fat booty dropping, I'mma do my thang
Long necks stay bopping boss, I'mma spit my game

[Six Tre]
I'mma come up in this thang, miscean and a fitted
Them new J's the piece and chain, looking mean on you bitches
I got a sleigh round my waistline, mossie oak down
Diamond style, boppers get the green and niggas get the frown
No smile get it twisted, and you will get stomped
Mayn your partnas ain't gon help you, cause your click full of chumps
Don't get your shit locked up, and disfigured
In the club drunk jumping, with them young crunk niggas
If you bump me, I'mma go G with it
Brought a mac up in the club, but I'm low key with it
All the bouncers show me love, cause they know G give it
They don't shake a nigga down, cause I'm O.G. with it
Ay dope boy in it, give me some room
I done came down, with the legion of doom
I'mma bust rounds, with the legion of doom
If you tremble with us kinfolk, you be in your tomb

[Hook - 2x]
We got the J's on, we in the club jumping
The boppers looking good, they trying to cut something
Sipping on Patrone, swisha full of purp'
Don't ask us how we do it, you know we got that work

[Trae]
I got them J's on my toes, heater on the hip
Not to mention I'm fifty deep, in case a hater wanna trip
Niggas bout to get the bidness, acting hard like a G
Who the fuck he talking to, it damn sho' ain't me
I'll bring it to your do', like Fed-Ex or the UPS
Introducing you to the ground, till the bouncers pumping your chest
I'm nothing like you done seen, hundred grand worth of ice lit
It ain't no need for thinking bout it, I garuntee I'm the shit
Loc's all across the face, of a gangsta inside the club
Just know that I'm watching niggas, they jumping they getting drug
I got clip in the homie dog, and on top of that A.B.N
And we don't give a fuck, niggas know ain't no stopping A.B.N
Boss on that Patrone, Jay'Ton got it cracking
Two thousand worth of ones, will have these roaching hoes stacking
Trae moving screwed up, and got boys in a daze
If I make it to the trunk, boys bout to hear them K's

[Hook - 2x]

[Intro]

[Six Tre]
Cause I'm crucial with it, Cotton Row up in this piece with me
Coedine got them hoes, getting blowed off the Remmy
Blue Dog, got em getting throwed off the Henny
They gon have em ass naked, we won't spend nan penny
I know, you lame ass niggas gon trip
When we dip up out the backdo', with your main chick
Might as well, go on take the handcuffs off her wrist
She going with me I got reservations at the Rits
She going to free, she gon get up in the G whip
And soon as we hit the room, she gon do the whole click
But I gotta commend you homes, mayn your broad too thick
My mella I like your taste, I'mma take your next chick simp

[Hook - 2x][Verse 1]
It's been hard to enjoy a smile when your life all trash
Most of my people flew to heaven damn I still ain't packed
I been searching for better days like my shit been jack
My last five been hell I’m just trying to get that back
I done built one hell of a story trying to get that sack
So many nights hanging on corners like a fucked up wreck
With everything falling apart I'm trying to keep shit intact
I pray I don't go in reverse and have to whip that crack
I done witnessed too many switches so my days don't trust shit
My spirit stay under pressure trying to hold so much
Devil around the corner guess he still on that fucked shit
Been fighting since I was 12, hell I still ain't done shit
Everyone counting on me hope my numbers don’t fall short
I’m still battling snakes coming at me in all sorts
Trying not to get bit, I gotta win like all sports
Still trying to sail this ship when they closed off all ports

[Verse 2]
Yeah I see it
But they gonna have to see me too
Kinda hard to vision a dream when you're stuck in a nightmare
Everything point against your love don't fight fair
Enemies playing angels only hoping your life spare
Sick of walking these shoes I'm trying to find me the right pair
Streets yelling out king I guess I'm still in the right chair
Trying to delete my circle before it's got by the right square
Been chosen their bed though it gave me a light scare
Feel like everyone watching even if it's a light stare
Looking at everyone who said fuck me I gotta fade 'em
And what they know don't apply, if I trip out can't no one save 'em
I know I'm in God's favor, therefore I can never hate 'em
Just sit you up with the business and shake em up 'til I wake 'em
Don't wait on me, my ride is in motion
Trying to make it when my kids turned 17 it was toasting
Seen too many take advance so I just focus on coasting
I've acquire to be greater so this show I was hosting, G

[Verse 3]
This is the trip ain’t
It it's all good nigga
I'm still at it nigga
Yeah I'm on it
My inner spirit keep telling me Trae you not a loser
Go lose them niggas in traffic and get them for what they do's ya
Nigga was getting older walking talking and laughing
And talking shit at the same time funny how time is passing
Lil Jared is fly as a Hulk
I know them girls gonna be in trouble you can tell when he talk
It ain't a game, baby houston is a star I can feel it
Give them a year, I swear he gonna be hot as a skillet
I know my life ain't been the best but I could say I'm alive
I'm thanking god that I ain't die I'm out here trying to survive
A lot of people seen me hurting so they turned away
Went about their business
I came in this alone so I'm gonna be there when I finish
I prayed to get out the hood
This lil nigga that could
I say it ain't all bad I'm just trying to make it for good
Mama told me to win I'ma do my best just so I can make her proud
Before either one of us make it to a cloud

[Outro]
And I'ma do that
Forreal
Bet your life on that one
Come on
I got it
Tell them niggas watch me
Yeah tell them niggas watch me
Yeah, tell them niggas watch me
I tried to tell em watch(Russell Lee)
Oooh-ooooooh, gots to do my thang
Oh-ooooh

[Trae]
It's been a long time coming, but I finally made it
Took the top off of the drop, then I finally sprayed it
They never thought I would be paid, but look at me now
I spit game, with a million dollar mouthpiece to lay it down
The representer from Texas, and known to get fly
They don't wanna see me crack a smile, cause my diamonds'll shine em down
And I know you heard of us, when I be Slow Loud And Bangin'
Corner to corner swanging all on the block, where the gangstas hanging
I gotta keep on thugging, blocks I'm hugging
Hatas I'm slugging, them boppers they getting no loving
Chrome I'm dubbing, Perellis be gliding and Southern
Lips be bumping, but they ain't gon never be loving
And just to keep it real with you, they prolly wanna see me fall
But I ain't and they can't stop me, so now they gon watch me ball
And grind forever and ever, cause money gon be made
And as long as I'm in this game, is as long as I'm getting paid

[Hook]
Maintaining, doing my thang
Staying on my grind, trying to get my change
See I gotta get mine, cause I can't get broke
And that's all I know
Maintaining, doing my thang
Swanging in a slab, gripping on wood grain
That's just the life that I chose
Don't worry bout mine, nigga get your's

[Trae]
I be in a state in your face, gliding a S-L-A-B
STS with nothing but T-I-N-T, reputation of a P-I-M-P
These hoes be hating, but never the less on my jock
Devastated by the knock I got, in a trunk with a fallen top
I'm a playa, nominated for G of the Year
With rocks in my ear, wood grain inside my hand when I steer
Reminiscing back in the day, when I was broke
But now I glide up the block, and turn heads till they neck look broke
Lil' Trae the same cat, they use to laugh at
Never thought that I would have to tell these hoes, to back back
Life is a trip, but then again I was destined to shine
24/7 everyday, I was motivated to grind
For better thangs, addicted to getting change
And now they be screaming my name, and saying I'm wrecking mayn
A Maab type dude from the guerillas on top, and hogging the lane
Dubs up to them hatas, watching me doing my thang

[Hook]

[Trae]
The Most Valuable Playa, block bender Trae up in a slab
If it's tinted I'm in it, tipping and turning banging the Ave
Picture me rolling a hundred miles per hour, to get away
To a low key la casa, where no drama can get my way
I'm in another zone, living it happy for a change
And since I'm stacking my change, I guess I just can't complain
I still remain to be the same cat, from day one
Cool to the motherfucker, but shining bright like the sun
A Guerilla legend, that's made of a Houston Texan
Balling to the top, and keeping it real without a question it ain't no doubt
In my mind, I grind mine and shine and shine mine
And grind, and people losing they mind and that's how it be
When you a G, I can't help it but to be playa
My living is not a joke, I'm forever after my paper
All I ever wanted was dough, and that's all I know
From here on out until I go, I'ma get it and that's fa sho

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Niggas lifting like what the fuck I expected
Caught up they feelings cause they feeling neglected
Since when this shit was cooling shit
But I guess these little niggas stuck in a wave of jealousy
I pray to God I don't get infected solid I'm blessed to be
How the fuck you count another nigga's pockets hating on em
Either cause he shining that woman you loved to bathe on em
Posted up talkin in the hood
Though shoulda been in the field
Right inside of my zone you get blitzed while I receive a ill
The thought of posse is perfect timing the MV promise
Probably cause my hustle be punishing niggas being honest
I guess this my fault cause I win I got what I needed nigga
I know its snakes that's why this your mind is weeded nigga
Everyone wanted these shoes, I hate to say they made to fit
Nothin but a nigga known as King, fuck the bullshit
Follow my lead I might just help you in your last days
And show you how the real niggas do it minus your fucked up plays

Couple homies turn to suckas

Gave you game and yeah it made you tough
Too tricky though so stay for what?
I used to take the bus
Get too loose I had to tape you up
But I was grindin and savin up

I pressed the gas in my favrite chucks
Shout it this kush that I'm blazin up
And the fact I ate stake  for lunch
I wish my biggest haters know my cake is up
Kill my worst enemies wit my favrite gun

Makin no apologies for how I'm livin

Now I could talk about, a car or some paint
Maybe jewelry that I bought, that you probably can't
The broads that I fuck, the people that I meet
But that shit won't help a young nigga, survive on the street
I can tell you bout how many, blocks I bled with the crack
Stood outside every night, trying to get myself a stack
But when niggas run up on you, with that thang to your back
Is your motherfucking ass, fin to know how to react
See hustling is some shit, that a nigga is born with
Not some game from a song, you can try to get on with
Now you can buy every song, bout crack ever made
But if it ain't in your heart, you ain't fins to get paid
Now read some Iceberg Slim, it might get you a bitch
But you'll never have a stable, you'll never be rich
Memorize all your Screw tapes, it won't make you a G
Cause niggas dying out here, trying to be they favorite MC

Lately I've been zoning, trying to get away from all of the pressure
These wanna-be G's that wanna-be MC's, need to get they shit together
It's whatever, niggas thinking they thugging cause they crunk off Pac
And everytime they step out on the block, they be the first to get shot
I don't know what you thinking, but dog we keep it gangsta for real
We took everything that we lived, and then supplied it with skills
I don't need no handout, cause I grind and I can shine on my own
Everything I talked about the memory, I ain't just make up no song
Better check my bloodline, everything I represent might get you shut down
Been in the midst of guerillas, respected I never backed down
I'm faithfully mobbing, while y'all be faithfully faking
Perpetrating trying to play that roll, will get your life faithfully taken
And dismissed bitch, you don't wanna get caught up in that street hype
If you ain't been in these streets, then you won't make it in that street life
I'm telling you mayn, better leave that dick-riding alone
And go on and do what you do, and take your fraud ass back home

A lot of thangs be on my mind, all the time
Move around, a lot of niggas be out here lying

Can't overlook shit, some shit you don't cross
Who the fuck are you to tell me what the hell I done
And who the fuck a nigga [?]
But only pointed fingers when they really needed you
You didn't help, and I didn't even trip about it
I was living for the hood you was getting out it
Go ahead, walk around and flip you out it
Everybody say they real, shit getting crowded
I highly doubt it, everything is fake
Instead of tryna give you only here to take
I'm nothing perfect, yeah I know we make mistakes
Something different we just call it [?]
Guess I gotta deal with it
I'm the king of the streets and I'm still with it

A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
I'm king, sittin' in my chair nigga
Try to take me off, I dare you nigga
Tell me something that's real nigga
Any hood, I'm there nigga
And look don't stare nigga
Diamonds got me looking like a flare nigga
Look bitch, I'm an asshole
Fuck everybody up, 'bout to take you down nigga
Broke niggas I don't like, neck looking like show lights
30 grand on slow nights
Bitch I'm talkin' Snow White
I been the truth ain't no hype
I'm what that is ain't no mights
[?], call it making a band
No flute, I'm a show her how to play your pipe
Fuck is you thinking?
Ain't no one realer than me in this bitch
What the fuck is you drinking?
Tipping this water
Bitch I'm so deep in the gutter to the point you'd think I was sinking
I don't really give a fuck, I'm off in this jungle
Look at this jacket I'm minkin'
Everything got to a movie, it ain't my fault if you missed it
Shouldn't have been blinking
Nigga fuck about 'er my way
Alicia try'na go to sleep
I don't fuck with you bitches who brand new
Tell 'em this dick ain't for cheap
I keep it gangsta, shout out to Keef
Shout to Teresa, shout out to Sosa
Shout out to Waka, shout out to me
Yea I'm a let my nuts hang like a poster

[Hook][Hook - 2x]
I never thought that I would, ever see the day
That my people, will try to use my life away
I really wish that I could leave, and go away
So it's best, to stay the fuck away from Trae

[Trae]
When the fuck, these niggas gon learn
I've been the realest thang, that done came in they life
And it hurt me daily to turn my back, but still I know they ain't right
No time to be shife, but still I know I gotta ride for my own
I prolly never would of been pissed, if I was riding alone
But situations in my life, done made me change for the best
I can't speak for the rest, but I know a lot of my life been a mess
I can't take back the past, so now I'm blaming it all on myself
I had niggas that came and left, while spending all of my wealth
But quietly kept, I'm bad for your health don't get too close
Cause I can't determine my friends and my foes, bitches and hoes
Where was they at, when I ain't had a damn thang in my pocket
Like I ain't see the love I gave em, when they took it and dropped it
So now I'm all across they face, and ain't no way they can stop me
And plus they know my attitude, be quick to go off like Rocky's
Can't knock it cause I ain't wrong, I speak the truth in this song
So don't come asking me bout shit, just leave me the fuck alone damn

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
So now they got the nerve, to say I'm on some high-seditty shit you tripping bitch
How the fuck is y'all talking down, and I grind for this don't make me click
Cause I'll do ya like I never knew ya, I gotta keep my guards up
Cause they say your own'll be quick to use ya, but not no mo'
Cause I would rather be doing bad, and they don't come around
Before I let em use me up, and try to weigh me down
I got a lot of anger inside, pride gotta keep me going
And the reason I'm one deep up in this game, is what's gon keep me flowing
My heart been soft at times, I tried to let em use my hand
But then they would push it up out the way, and I could never understand
But now I do, a lot of these niggas don't give a fuck about me
So when they see me loading up, I advise that they get from round me
You never thought I could find me, but now I done found myself
My cousin on lock for two, so I'm repping him by myself
These niggas done got me heated, so I'm headed for my shelf
Cause I feel like, they wanna put a couple slugs in my health

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
I never seen the picture clear, than the way that I seen it today
These niggas out here gon learn about pain, from fucking with Trae
I'm the one that'll ride or die, at the drop of a dime
And I don't respect y'all the same, cause y'all done crossed over lines
How you gon look me in my eyes, and steady lie to my face
You know we both be down to die, so don't you come in my space
I heard the other day that you said, that you was down with the click
Don't be so quick to hop the fence, you might just get in some shit
That you can't get out of, cause I ain't gon be saving the day
See I'm a lonely guerilla, that might come mobbing today
Better get out the way, before I'm feeling like I'm disrespected
And the second I reminisce, it's gon be getting hectic
It ain't no calming me down, cause I've been calm in the past
You niggas ain't finna be stressing me, if you try to show ass
And I don't need ya at all, cause y'all ain't true to the game
I know that y'all the type of niggas, that be faking for fame

[Hook - 4x](talking)
Houston, Texas

I tryed to chill but they keep on speakin my name
So now they bout to get interested to my pain
Momma please forgive me for what I'm about to do
If the Drama start I never meant to hurt you
But if everybody keep on fuckin with me

[Verse 1-Trae]

Everybody wanna know what I'm haulin
Inside of my chest-inside of my head but it ain't no phony
Godamn what you wanna go and fuck with Trae fo'
Alittle bit of fame but it ain't gon' pay hoe
Now you gon'feel how the fuck I feel ain't nobody finna move till I say so
They say you wanna know about Trae and Doug who is T-Ray? nigga it's the Maab
It's Trae ready from the S.U.C stay ridin his dick must be ya big job
It's Trae and Z-Ro we the kinfolk I think y'all require too much info
Niggas say that I turned my back, that's falsified and him and I both know
Dinkie told me not to feed the fans and what's fam is fam and stick to the plan
But everywhere that I go niggas say I cap-and they speak on shit they don't understand
Want every be no more Guerilla Maab if you step up to me I'll be solo maab
Me and Ro underground for the ABN, Slow Loud And Bangin the rap game revolvin'

After this here I'm a let you make it, if you still wanna go I'm a raise the stocks
Right about now I'm about to blow and kick ass nigga I done had it
So don't you come with no hoe ass shit this young asshole finna let you have it

[Hook-Billy Cook]
Father please forgive me for what I'm about to do

Drama keep calling me-Drama keep calling my phone

[Verse 2-Trae]
They say they know about Trae who the fuck lied to them
Cause everyday that I breathe I'll be forced to live
And forcing no slugs to protect myself, I'm a asshole I ain't got nothin to give
I've got nothin to lose, get these blues
Some of these niggas don't wanna pay dues
I hope they buckle up they belt
Cause it's finna get rough 1 of these niggas finna get bruised
Why you start it if you ain't want the beef
You got plex you really don't want no teeth
These Silvaback girls come on dogg
You better get ya weight up before you fuck with me
Cause I'll maab on a nigga-swung on a nigga
Hit ya block up to harm me a nigga
Put 'em in a figure 4 and get raw with a nigga
Put 'em in a box so they don't find that nigga
Everybody wanna hate me like I changed
Said the hot block since I got fame
But I know one thing they better get they bitch ass
The fuck from round me cause I got aim
So I'm back again-I got a pack of men
I pull up in a black 'Lac with a back again
Cause these cats don't know how to act again
Trae they attitude off track again
So what you niggas hatin on if it's the crime you gon' be waiting long
Cause day after day it's gonna be takin on, I put it on leak and the 4's I'm skatin on
I promise you don't really wanna take it there and I advise you for this
Ain't too many finna be too many finna be after this
Cause these bitch niggas done got me pissed
[*bomb blowing up*, crowd cheering*][Hook: Poo Bear MDMA] x2
Trying hard to speak and fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction, so part of the plan
When something is broken and you try to fix it
Trying to repair it any way you can

[Verse 1: Trae]
Everything wrong, I feel like a nigga crashin'
Knowing I gotta make it no matter whatever happens
Now they know where to go it's like everything a distraction
What the fuck I'm gonna do is what everyone keep asking
Looking at the news got me sick of seeing my face
Every time I hit the block I'm sick of catching the case
I'm tryna get it together but everything outta place
As soon as I get a break it's like everything go to waste
[?] you would swear that I was goin' crazy
Probly [?] but I'm fightin' for my babies
Fightin with the one muthafucking hand I got
I'm able to block you I swear it's something amazing
The greatest, yea you can tell them that I'm the greatest
You looking for a king, tell them that I'm the latest
One of the realest ever to do it from the heart
So it'll probly be a minute before somebody can fade this
Still tryna find the way I can get to the top
I'm fear they tryna find the way, they can't get me to stop
I know it's probly only there cause they feel like I'm hot
I'm here to make the best of it leavin' niggas a shot
It's my time, but you already know though
Too many people hatin' so I'd rather do it solo
Soon as I get a break they wanna take it like a photo
Even if I don't get it fast, I'mma get it slow mo
Yea I'mma get it slow mo
You never know though
But I'mma stand strong
And let the wind blow
I know shit changed
It's all good though
I ain't left yet
I know how this shit go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Shit ain't cool, shit ain't fair
What a nigga gotta do to try and get up there?
Scared by they air but they ain't sharing
Must we Tuskegee Airmen
Everytime they get a hair in?
Get a chair but tables turn
A hundred miles in the hairpin
You get a seat, they say get a suit
Cause they won't see you if you don't wear them
Invisible man go to war with a suit
[?], cause we scare them
Gangsta enough to flip the table over
But got the manners to then push the chair in
Niggas wanna be on thrones
But all the power's with the chairmen
I just wanna be in my zone
Cause a nigga don't care then
Word to God, he made me bright
Word to God, man he gave me breath
Police out here tryna give you life
Streets out here tryna give you death
Energy tryna give me strength
Enemies tryna give me stress
R.I.P. that nigga Clip
ABN, F 'N F

[Trae:]
They say now the city is back it's something strange
Starch post sitting caught under something ya couldn't name
Dranking off inside the Range seats same color cocaine
With a chopper who understanding it's nothing something insane
Picture this whip flipping glass imitating aerobics
Panel rally roof this bitch in the back of me claustrophobic
Niggas pussy in my book tell em that was already noted
The crown is mine and sign the Houston the city already wrote it
I'm gladder than a jungle where other niggas get nervous
Designated in sewers where cellular's don't get service
Thankin house of where smokers the only place you can purchase
And such a put in the trap where the workers see through the service packs
Was never social all I know is my pen and my pad
I'm on the phone with momma C reminiscing too Chad
These niggas never get the picture they vision is bad
Nigga the truth is here only the [?] can question ya had

[Talks over Hook: Young Buck]
Trae what it do big homie?
Y'all know how this go right
Real recognize real mayne
[Laughs]
The truth hurr!
But the real shall live in the...

Brother from another mother
And what that mean if you don't stand for sumthin then you goin fall for anything
As I walk in these stars jean
Pop my trunk to make they cars lean
The hood got bissar things like Rated-R screens
So my parental adviser into the youth is the truth
And back it up with proof
Don't nobody know what's happening till it's happening to you
Now they askin you what's happening cause it's happening to them too
Them gone ain't too many niggas ridin' but I'm drivin' Way Park
I got Bun in the passenger Trae let's pull up in they yard
I'm not askin for space bitches I'm a go hard
Now when your swangers stick out far they'll help you bo-gar
Dueces and Traes, twist ya fingaz throw em up to God
Watch this Cashville nigga as I lead the four stars
Yeah you see me oil spill niggas, BP
I got Texas ways put dueces and ya traes
Yeah

[Hook]
[Big Pokey:]
Throw them dueces up and the traes too
On the duece-dueces up and them K's too
I don't play fool all this cash I'm stackin'
Assualt rifled up bitch like I'm mad Iraq
They say if a nigga fall on ya he'll roll on ya
You blessed and try'na progress he'll prolong ya
Best thang for a hater keep him out my reach
Cause Sensei he'll fade a nigga like a bottle of bleach
Scott Blocc in this bitch and it's on and poppin'
Straight drop in this bitch nigga zones is lockin'
My banger is black, the swaggers are turning
If I catch him playin games this banger will burn him
Yeah I'm hard on a chick, I mash on em
In this Spurg gettin head countin cash on em
Crock-woollier till the winter yet we play to win
Mob style Cashville nigga ABN

Earthquake breaking here i come to save ya

[Verse 1]
Im in this 2011 still screwed up
Trunk flexin like its bout to beat a dude up
Fu-k the world I swear they fu-kin my mood up
And the recession the people fucking my food up
I hear bleed and tell him to put his dogs on it
Or hit j dog and tell him to put his hogs on it
No dreams of NBA but I play the game
I play the D you motherfuckers know the name
Im talking all night sittin on white bricks
I chipped a couple diamonds I need these lights fixed
Bitches trying to see I tell them to look harder
Either fuck or leave you'll never be a starter
I only love money that's why the nigga hustle
Million dollar crib yeah bitch I really hustle
1000% real I don't know how to fake
Fuck with me and catch a earthquake

[Hook] x7
Earthquake breaking here i come to save ya

[Verse 2]
Im moving slow getting fast money
Move wrong and I'll put you on your ass dummy
Im a G if its drama ill take it wherever
Let the 90 hit the block and heat up the weather
Have these haters tripping like they lost balance
Money machine broke I done lost balance
Fuck it all I know is that I am getting doe
I am blowing slow back door and go hunting for more
You can find me in the H riding paper plates
Blow underneath tryin to move it thru a couple states
At benihana trying to eat a couple steaks
At the rate I'm going ima need a couple breaks
Then again fuck it I don't plan to stop
Till the end till i end up in the sand or drop
Tell em recognize I'm the realest living
And this pain is what I'm given

[Hook] x7
Earthquake breaking here i come to save ya

[Verse 3]
Earthquake breaking here i come to save ya
Life still a bitch find me headed to Jamaica
Might not make it back but I'm trying to get this paper
100 miles per hour like a NASCAR racer, chaser
Get in the way an ill erase ya
Unload the clip and guarantee the bullets face ya, dig that
I'm feeling like they wanna see me fallin off
They better chill fore I get lil bam to haul em off
Have them 2's working like they fresh out of a gym
Throw em in the lake body and label a swim
Gorilla shit what you niggas know about it
Kill em in silence only way to go bout it
The perfect definition of g shit
Ya talk beef but I bet it won't be shit
And if it was ill show ya what it is
Have ya missing from ya wife and ya kids

[Hook] x7
Earthquake breaking here i come to save ya[Chorus: DRAM]
I been lost, tryna find menin to this crazy life
Where do I go, right or left
I'm so lost, no one's best
Look to the sky, I wonder why
I been so lost, don't know where to go
All I know is I'm not fallen down

[Verse: Trae Tha Truth]
My heart is cold today, feel like this won't go away
I'm in the wind, the trunk, I hope it blow away
On a mission, till this Whip get rolled away
This shit I'm goin through, no elevation
These shadows I'm passin, no destination
Mentally, I was lost, no navagation
I be dambed I give up for your fasanation
Stressed bout them wrongs, still prayed, cause them days were long
Keep shit, when they played me wrong
I'm in the battlefield, hopin I make it home
I feel like all this fuckery, they play me wrong
I only did it out of love, the hate was strong
A lot of people said my wave was gone
I don't forget shit, I'd rather stay alone
I'd rather sleep, than face my fear
Give something to me, don't know if I even see it
What I'm going through, think I need me to eat
Ross called, told me to take that bitch nigga out his head
I don't know what to tell him, cause ain't nothing to sell him
But if he ride, I ride to heaven
I'm ten minutes from there, keep my hand on the weapon
Came from the bottom, no one ever fed us
I'm real, why niggas tryna dead us
I'm on a different page, no one ever read us
Try me, that's enough to get your head bus
Lookin at the newest bankroll, that shine
Never know who comin for you when your face hot
Why the good niggas always end up in the grave
If a fuck nigga left, they just switch spots
I need peace like Jigga, when I'm in a wearlwind, never gettin better
I never see the sun if it wasn't for the weather
I don't see my son much, hopin I get to make that better
Gotta keep it together when the time comes, know my mind numb
Yeah, this shit kinda hard when you think about it
Cause god called, so I hold that 9 1
If he don't pick up, I see him face to face instead
Faith is real, if not, I be dead
Stuck in place, no way to see ahead
People think they only safe for bread
Shit was dark, I'm tryna live my life
In my chest, somebody dropped a knife
On site, I excepted what it was
I had a solid day with Shife

[Chorus: DRAM]
I been lost, tryna find menin to this crazy life
Where do I go, right or left
I'm so lost, no one's best
Look to the sky, I wonder why
I been so lost, don't know where to go
All I know is I'm not fallen down[Hook: T.I.]

Fuck niggas ain't beef, they tofu

To the condo where they eat kuchi hole
I'm stupid ho. Run through the ho
You dream about it, I do it, ho
Ass fat, face beautiful
Throw 'em a sack of twenties
They good to go
Niggas don't fear me, they should though
And they can't hear me, they would though
If they was up on my plateau, but I'm wacko
Bet that ho

Got a rocket in the club and ain’t afraid to pop it
Nigga run your lips I put that barrel to your sockets
Haters out here hating cause that flexing never stopping
Keep that blue dream in my bomb and the hash for the toppings
That niggas all stay on me, so homie don’t play with me
I keep them bills, I keep that lean, I keep a ak with me
A real street nigga, catch me in the streets nigga
Got something to hit your chest hard
And I ain’t talking liquor
Don’t need no nigga fuck rapping
Nigga talk that shit I’m blasting
That .44 to your face bitch, it’s gonna be a closed casket
Your whole life is a storyline
You ain’t gangsters, you niggas lie
Make massacres like the valentine
Turn this club into the columbine

        Dirty condoms
Got these problems
Tryna end them with some violence
Now I'm wildin'
Bitches riding
Getting sick of all this silence
Bitches know I'm blowin dope
And choking on this reefer smoke
Bitches know I'm blowin dope
And choking on this reefer smoke
AK47 it'll cook you not a weapon
Its a blessing
Get you rested
Indica sativa
I get lifted by this reefer
Man I'm just a fuckin dreamer
And a schemer
Whipping beamers
Only ridin in two seaters
You know how we tote these heaters
Gettin blasted by this passion
My shit got you doing backflips
Like gymnastics
Yeah I'm spastic (ooh)
I'm so wavy
Someone save me
In these waters like the navy
Getting lazy
You don't wanna see me when I'm gettin crazy
You don't want to see the child of the devil
On your level
Don't get settled
I'm the best don't need a medal
You look disheveled
Torture you
No remorse for you
You know that I'm torchin you

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Niggas hate I got it locked
In these streets they say I'm hot
Bein' Real a' get you got
Probably something that you're not
I just got another Glock
Tell the plug I need another block
And I don't fuck with niggas
Niggas get you popped
That's why I'm on the block wit hundreds and a stock
Who they tryna block? I tell them I ain't fo' it
Play it like I'm Curry, how could you ignore it
Hatin' got you booked, if Stephen King had wrote it
Me I'm doin' me, it's something that's important
I rep for Houston like Whitney nigga
Boy N Da Hood, ain't no Ricky nigga
Try to picture what Audemar fit me nigga
Might just buy the whole spot cuz I'm picky nigga
Me and [?]
He make a call I'm jumpin' out my body
Somebody get hit we like Illuminati
We push it and kick it like we do karate
Now who they gon' try
Tell them to fly and I can get'em the crash
[?] better get your cash
Fuck nigga cut it, I ain't talkin grass
I'm from a place where shit get hard
Everybody out wanna be stars
One on my waist, and got one in the car
Ain't no fear, tryin' not to get scored
Want some millions, turn out some hard
Fuck niggas it's a full time job
Slip up, might turn up robbed
Pissed off now I'm talking to God

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Realist nigga nothin' less
I'm the streets and you a guest
All that hatin' got you stressed
Bitch hate on me and get ya pressed
I just got my sack up on everybody
Might pull up trippin with everybody
Clear the block and my clip out on everybody
Not a Migo but Takeoff on everybody
Ain't no time to try to talk and finesse
Disrespect and I'll be at yo' address
If I go to work, I'll bring it right to yo desk
Ain't no H and O I take it right to you chest
Let you make it nigga, how?
You only trap what I allow
King wit it nigga, bow
Fuck next I was now
Fuck with the Truth and shit get out of hand
If we don't lock up I take it to your man
Do what I want all day I have a plan
I'm from the west I get you where you stand
Sick of niggas playin foul
Teach a nigga like a lecture
Run a chopper 'til it catch ya
Might just end up on a stretcher

I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, movin' slow in the Benz
Lookin' at these suckers through these Cartier lens
Reachin' out to God, hope he overlook my sins
Clear sunroofs open up to feel the wind
Feelin' like Khaled, tell them all I do is win
Only countin' racks if they comin' by the tens
Whole world watchin' cause they know I'm settin' trends
I'm King Truth, bitch I'm 'bout it
Streets locked, bitch I got it
See me lose, bitch I doubt it
I'ma check somethin', no deposit
Villains comin' out the closet, probably 'cause they know I'm solid
I ain't there to look and make it, I'ma take flight like a pilot
Like Big Mo, I was chose
Like Derrick, how I Rose
My money long, I expose
Like Jay-Z changin' clothes
I build traps like kaboose
I'm still with it, think I'm froze
I'm heavy with it, nothin' light
Got rows like old foes

[Chorus]
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz

[Verse 2]
I'm back at it, nothin' safe
'Bout ten Summers, played the race
Don't get mad, fix your face
Jump all cool like I'm grease
Can't take mine, get your place
Trunk floatin' into space
Don't touch mine, check the waist
All black, check the race
I'm representin' Robert Bates, to the whole world, he the greastest
He spot like he Mikey Vegas
He still the king, I'm the latest
Me and Moxiii 'bout to zone out
You don't understand that, you on the wrong route
It's my time, I can't hold out
I bring the heat like it was cold out
No rollout, I'm just ridin'
All black tint like I'm hidin'
Got a new wave, I'm just divin'
Better take your seat 'cause I'm risin'
It's real life, ain't no rhymin'
Everything I got from me grindin'
I be damned I don't get to the top, I was on my way like I'm drivin'
I'm tryna shut down the game
And after that, lead it with fame
Ain't nothin' I got to explain
Just give me that check with a name
And I do not feel I can change
Ain't no reachin', I'm outta your range
I come take you, you think I was strange
Hit the whip and I switch up the frame

[Chorus]
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz
I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends
I'm comin' down, real slow in my Benz[Hook - 4x]
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

[Z-Ro]
Hold up a minute I'm the king of the ghetto
Holdin the rap game like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave keep a gun and a shovel
And pourin acid to eat up the evidence
I be in the rear view now you wonder where I went
I'm a get you if I owe ya-visit ya residence
Lay the murk game down and then I'm a hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed so they can't see the shinin
They think it was Z-Ro cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze with bags of ice in it
My three-fifty-seven pretty but ain't nothin nice in it
Too many bitches and not enough rubbers
Got so many of my real niggas under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life-life close like shutters
Godamn stayin healthy is hard as a motherfucker

[Trae]
Fresh off the block G's know my name
Suicide hood and 4-do's swangin the frame
Cocked up and sideways when I'm tippin the lane
Showin Asshole By Nature so they know what I claim
Ain't no doubt these diamonds in my mouth the best shown
Well known reppin Texas finna show that I'm well blown
H Town to Vegas niggas know that I hail chrome
The feds see I'm ballin so they tappin my cell phone
And I ain't mad plus I got the hood at my back
That'll go to war with anybody playin with my stacks
Hit the stash while the slab sideways in the Lac
Lookin like a "Superstar" Mike D and Fat Pat
Maybe hit 'em with the ghetto they'll know that I'm real
And know that I'm still like UGK keepin it trill
Look at the grill I promise I'll be givin you chills
Like I was Screw in '98 while he was touchin the wheels
Hold 'em up I'll show you how we rep-in-the-south
Tall tees, jeans creesed, J's step in the south
And any hater runnin up finna get left in the south
We keep a trunk full-of-bang that get ya deaf in the south
And I be fuckin with J Prince and Z-Ro will stay down
My kin folk Rollin we gon come for the take down
And show 'em how it go ain't no more touchin the Grey Hound
We shine for the south get with it or lay down

[Hook - 4x]
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

[Jay'Ton]
I'm from the H where niggas on the block all day
Where we grip the wood and flip 4's all day
With the king of the ghetto you know we loc all day
From the tre', to the North, on back to West-8
It ain't a doubt I'm young but I'm a ball for mine
22's on the Lac sittin tall for mine
VS1's in my grill when I'm crawl the line
And if a jacker runnin up he gon be fallin down
We gon'do it for the Pat and we gon'do it for the Screw
Doug gotta red, but I'm still ridin blue
Bring it to the south and I'm a show you what it do
Trunk up, top down when I come through-Slow, Loud, to the Bang
Put it like pimp got diamonds on the brain
If it ain't a slab better get up out the lane
Diamonds in my grill got the hood off the chain

[Boss]
Don't worry bout a thing...
I'm from the south where the riders and the rollers be at
CC's in my grill I pay a thousand just to see that
The penitentary is where they never hold me at
Haters be talkin down but they never hold me back(fuck y'all)
From a small gram to a whole zone
If a nigga talk down I'm a break his nose bone
Cop a new set of 83's and get my poke on
Get a new sack, roll it fat and get my smoke on
Fuck a law since a nigga don't know who it is
It's Boss with a mint in my mouth handlin my biz
Every diamond in my mouth I handle like they my kids
Drank follow my diamonds when I pop open the lid
I take 'em to Johnny to get a check up
Fall up in the hood and kick it just to pick my check up
ABN and Hoover gang bitch so respect us
Ears and my neck infested with diamonds in Texas

[Hook - 4x]
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

[Z-Ro]
Blucker, blucker, blucker that's how my gun go
If I'm lookin aggitated bitch you better run ho
I used to do the bagguetes but not VS 1's though
Princess cutts up and down Johnny done those
I got loud ice just like Paul Wall
Shinin down south brighter then all y'all
When it's time to get ya jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shinin at all
Check me out on the 1st and the 15th I'm somethin like a pimp
Even with a suspended license I'm still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash ain't nothin I can't get
5 duece Hoover cuz, ain't nothin like a crip
Ride with a revolver I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggas tryna make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank I don't even trust my bitch
I'm from the south, and I got diamonds in my mouth

[Chorus 3x]

[-Chorus Screwed-][Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I don't fuck with niggas
They say my tempo fucked up
I tell them niggas fuck'em
Get at me or shut the fuck up
You looking for that street shit
Nigga I'm what the fuck up
Bitch I'm on some M.O.E. shit
Nigga you might get fucked up

[Bridge: Trae Tha Truth]
Niggas saying they looking for me
Tell them niggas I ain't hard to find
Pillow talking, dick sucking, ass niggas
Better close they mouth, and get shit shutdown
Play with them all the fuck you want
I be damn, you come fuck with mine
Bitch I’m king, I don’t give no fuck
Fuck em, yea bitch you’re out my mind

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Some in the back of the shit of what’s next
Two hundred in the trunk, fuck clips
Feeling like anybody get it, so don't flex
Tell them I extend the clip, don’t stretch
Bitch niggas get crash, no bricks
Talk slick, no cares, get chick
No past, fuck last, you next
When I click, pussy nigga they ain't say shit
Say it to my face bitch ass
But a nigga get your whole tree shook bitch
Any nigga want beef, getting cook bitch
I’m a goddamn fool, don't doubt that
4-door, all black, hop out that
ABM, outlaw, 3Hunna
Bump first on a nigga, I’m ‘bout that

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
(x2)

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Young nigga, I'm wassup (3Hunna)
If he think he tough, he get fucked up (bang now)
Ain't playing games we wassup
Keep big 30s when our guns tough
So we fucked up, you get fucked up
These niggas with me don't give no fuck
I’m on some other shit, I might go nuts
Call Broski up with the thirty up
Go nuts with the bitch [?] words that stunt
Ride up on the nigga, all he see is dust
OTF in this bitch, all I see is us
3Huna bitch, all I trust is us
You get your skull bust with that 30 boy
They talking like they bout it, they ain't making noise
I’m from 3Hunna, we make extra noise
Young nigga packing extra toys
They ain't coming where I'm from, I'm a savage boy
Fuck nigga, catch me in traffic boy
I said fuck nigga catch me in traffic boy

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
(x2)[Intro]
What don’t kill me make me stronger
(Preach!)
Ya dig? I dig
It’s like it’s some kimble slice or something like that
To rockin’ this knock ok
I come here every time and light their motherfuckin’ throat
Vandross

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Hopin’ they’d bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they tribute heaven, ain’t no G’s in hell
They lock me up for sellin’ dope but they move keys as well
I keep my mouth closed cuz after all, who did Jesus tell?
God – that’s who I talk to on a daily basis
I put in word for my people but they don’t wanna pay me faces
I got patience but I’d lose my blessing if they’d make me chase it
I can see the evil in their eyes, they can’t even think their hatred
Death gotta be easy cuz life is hard
Making decisions that drive you crazy if life is involved
Don’t owe no money if your husband or your wife is involved
But divine intervention is what Jesus Christ is involved
Question: what is the dollar signs, a snake through sticks?
Trust a snake and get bitten, the sticks that used to beat us
We just givin’ game to all the men, women, boys & girls
That’s tryna maintain in a fucked up world, that’s right

[Hook: Z-Ro]
You already know how they hate me, mane (in this fucked up world)
In the world that treat me so cruel (damn, it is fuckin’ time I..)
Imagine though no matter how hard they’d try (in this fucked up world)
I’m a asshole so I do what I do (but remember that in this fucked up world)

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Being full with this, I must confess all the enzone to the stress
A bullet wound to the homie head, he died his best
Going crazy, holding my faith, realizing I’m blessed
Got me praying, like get a break before they put me to rest
Ain’t nothing promised plus it’s hard for me to smile knowing this shit hurts
My brother doing life, somehow I feel like this shit don’t work
I’m living for the day like ain’t no place for me tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Walkin’ with the homie late night, hope he forgive me for my sins
Hoping that my space ain’t occupied the day that I get in
These haters got me messed off, I’m livin’ with my fist off
If I don’t make it home, that Houston pick up where I left off
Loyalty and stripes, it ain’t a day I take the vest off
To stop it they gon' have to take my chest off
I never meant to cause drama to my brothers or mama
Even though I feel I’m losing my mind in this fucked up world

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Verse 3: Noble]
Shot ‘em to death and left for bleedin’ for his fam there to see
Less than three months after my Machiavelli deceased
For Gadhafi, I carry on with the weight on my shoulders
So the lesson’s count my blessings, now I’m leading the soldiers
ABN outlaws, got my H Town niggas
Got my weight up with my hapers, paying back – now I’m bigger
Still thugging in this game mane, hugging the block
Industry try to black ball us, we remind ‘em of Pac
Some of the realest in the game, I’m just statin’ the facts
Bear witness, can’t you see that we’re under attack?
We never meant to cause drama, we just tryna get dollars
I wrote a letter to the president, to Mr. Obama
I ain’t seen too much change, feel like shit getting worse
I try to go to no more funerals, I’m sick of the church
Spit that ghetto gospel, hope for black boys and girls
We outlaws in this fucked up world
In this fucked up world

[Hook: Z-Ro][Intro]
Fuck calling me right now?
Hello
Yo
Hold on nigga, what the fuck you talking about?
Nigga my motherfucking day ain't even started yet
You on my motherfucking line
Type of gay ass shit is this?
But this could go one of two ways man
Either you gonna let me continue about my business
Or y'all about to have a motherfucking problem nigga
Fuck wrong with you? Get off my line bitch
Stupid motherfucker

Fuck the world's end today
Today, fuck 'em

[Verse 1]
Went to sleep tripping, woke up felling like "fuck 'em"
It hard to be humble when these snakes ans hyenas rush ya
Irritation at an all time high, nothing about him
Just a temper in a clip full of bullets, fuck your discussion
Wish a motherfucker would jump high, he gonna be buzzing
Look people, I've been minding my business, why the fuck you fussing?
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do bitch
I'm real, I'm not like you bitch
So please don say the wrong shit
Ain't no maybes, I'ma come through bitch
No pass, oh yes
Nigga fuck with Trae and get fucked up
Yeah, I've got an attitude like I was Eric Wright
Covered in all black and then ticked off
You better leave me alone, get me wrong
One word, you'll have a nigga all up in your home
This shit I'll only say for a nigga hating, hitting 9-1-1
Now I'm all up in your phone

[Verse 2]
I'm on some other shit
Pussy ass niggas flyer than birds
Give a fuck about you
I'll get you cancelled playing with words
I know this bitch on side of me only good for working my nerves
All this drama, hoe approach me with caution
You better swerve
Shit was written on my face
Let a nigga trip disrespect that
I click first, I don't sit back
You slide now, I can't get that
I guess that's just the motion
But I know the day I'm owed one
In this white Murciélago
Mercy, I ain't gonna show none
Hoe shit? I don't know one
I'm king, recognizing no one
I hit it like I can't turn down
You might get a kid with no refund
I'ma show a nigga with no rewind
So if I said it, I meant it nigga
Just know you got me fucked up
Don't try shit 'cause I'm with it nigga
Just know you got me fucked up
Don't try shit 'cause I'm with it nigga

I'm down for life, gangsta for life

Gangster for life, till the day that I die
I promise I'll standing high
Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down, gangsta for life

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
It's been a minute, niggas heard from the truth
While they thinking it was over, you can tell 'em that a nigga back
With everything that I lost, I was sick of being shitted on
Tell them that I'm here to pay a nigga back
Fully automatic in the trunk put ya' hands on deck
Somebody going have to get it when I come around
Everybody talk that shit saying they ready for whatever like a G
But when I'm at it, it ain't none around
Homie I ain't nothing like them niggas that you playing with
With any wrong way, I guarantee that niggas spread shit
Take it up there, I put a nigga on his ass
Tryna' take it there, there will be the people that ya' laying with
Bring it to the streets, I can show you what I'm good for
You can find me in the gutta', where you niggas never could go
Jump for real, whether you niggas never could go
24/7, you can find me in the hood ho
For every nigga in the cell, every nigga in the grave
You can tell 'em that I'm riding for the team
For the ones that I feel and the ones who ain't going make it tonight
I'm a finna' show you why they call me the king
Nothing less than a g-a-n-g-s-t-a
Go and give it your best, so wear your vest today
What I'm on will leave you more than stress today
Put ya' on a position where you rest away

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm alone at home, loaded back up and then I'm gone
If I'm a get ya' then I'm on my way to show up at ya' door
All I know is if it's time I gotta' go for what I know
You can tell 'em it's fuck 'em until I'm up under the floor
I'm on this backstreet all black lights off
A bunch of bullets ain't no telling where they might floss
If I hit 'em, I bet I got you doing that graveyard shift
For a time, nigga lights off
Call me the weather man
Cause if I come out of the trunk
I guarantee somebody finna' get rained on
Everybody within a hundred yard from head to toe
I swear I'm in the zone like my aim is gone
To everyone that I forgot, I'm coming back for ya'
Tell the team get out the way, I'm finna' bad for ya'
I'm going hard till I even up stats for ya'
I'm the king tell 'em to throw it wear I sat with ya'
Cheeah, I'm in the zone
Somebody put a nigga on before I click it I get with ya'
If I end up up in the cell and never get free
Then everything I represented finna' get with ya'
All I know is for the streets I'm killing this shit
All the niggas bout the money it wasn't for me
Bitch nigga move around it ain't nothing to see
In the legend of the greats is where I'm a be

[Hook](*talking*)
Huh, they gotta feel us on this one right here mayn
H-Town to D-Town, bout to mash on these mark ass niggas
Feel what I'm saying, gotta respect what's given to you right now
Ain't no games getting played, you know who this be nigga
Asshole By Nature, Slow Loud And Bangin
Better yet relax, I got this

[Trae]
It's time to bring it to they face, bitch I been a asshole for life
Motherfuckers hollin' out plex, but they don't lace the Nike's
Attitude never mistaken, so these bitches can get it
Forty rounds in a clip is like church, I bet you get lifted
If you heard about A.B.N., you know these hands is sick
I got a bob and a weave game, to leave em stiff as a brick
Shepo, Jay'Ton, Dub, Boss and Rick
Plus the other hundred and twenty, who stay ready to click
Shot what these niggas talking, like they ready for drama
I shut em up and have they folk signing, bout old as they mama
I got my homies Tri and Tae, packing K's for Trae
Unless I tell em pop the trunk, so I can get it and spray
I represent it for the hood, but anybody can get it
And if they heard about the Maab, I bet they don't wanna get with it
Slow Loud when I bang, so I rep for Screw
For all my dogs and the Bloods, and my cousin Blue

[Hook: Tae]
This to all my hustlers ballers, all the shot callers
Range up, and open place
And if you see a bitch nigga, thinking that he's slick
Never hesitate, to put him in his place
See this is some gangsta shit
Trae and Tae hitting, with a gangsta click
S.L.A.B. what it do, y'all respect this shit
Making moves on 45, get it how we live it it's our time to shine hey

[Boss]
All bitch niggas, better shake the spot
So many C's in my handshaking, look like a zip-lock
I put a H in front of the C, call it Hoover Crip hopping
0-5, all the lil' homies call ruger grip Glocks
I know it sounds crazy, when niggas use to killing cops
They been harassing our homies, and they thrashing the block
But I got love for the homies, so I'm passing a chop
Pass the corner and double back, then I blast at the flock
Do em more dug than a shovel, filling bags up with cops
I'm in a six tre rag, and bitch it drag when it drop
13's and I drive em, soak up my rag it ain't sock
I keep a 4-4 mag, and when I'm mad bitch it pop
I mean it crack, I keep a new flag in the Lac
Eight placks to the back, fresh set of them cats
Hat to the left back, big Crip in the pack
See me throwing up my set, steady Cripping the mat cuz

[Hook]

[Tri]
Been real off top, cause 200 Clan be the god damn block
Real what I am, and the shit won't stop
Haters they plot, want it with me not
Make your body drop, one blow one shot
Tri in this bitch, and the clip's what I claim
A.K.A. Yellow Dame, hot as fire spitting flame
Recognize 'fore I came, no lie untamed
What these niggas trying to bring, ain't nothing ain't a thang
Got killers in the clip, got killers in the grove
Got killers in the North, and the South slow your roll
'Fore you end up knocked off, wanna play me for soft
Bitch ass gon get lost, in a river pay the cost
What you wanna do Blood, chill out or get drug
Peel out or get plugged, pussy nigga what the fuck
Yeah I might be small, but I got a lot of clout
Representing out the South, hold your tongue watch your mouth

[Hook]

(*talking*)
If that ain't, self explanatory right there
These marks gotta understand, it's real in the field
Can't put another fo' motherfuckers together, that's gon shut shit down like this
Bitch ass nigga need to go back to they pen and pad, and rewrite they shit
We do shit like this, everyday all day mayn
Asshole By Nature, G-Maab Entertainment

[Verse 1: ~Trae~]
Tell em I been a soldier to the end on a mission dedicated to get it
I never retreat nor did I quit I never run for cover tell em forget it
I'm scared for one hole in the crime, highly respected on this street shit
Better salute within my presents I'm amazing with this G shit
They try to save the hood wouldn't needed I ask em since when?
But came king of the city even undisputed since then
When I was broke I chose to get fixed in
Anythang either way gettin kicked in
I know these haters about to get mix in
In all the shit I'm bout to put a nigga wrist in
Don't count me out remember they left me alone I only got stronger
Against my shoes and they ain't look back on the money I ended up even got longer
Then a bunch of people waiting to see the day that I'm ending
But you can tell em that it's just the beginning
So salute me

[Hook: Brian Angel]

[Verse 2: Trae]
They put tags on this ripped and I just copped out to replace the roof
Instead I only removed it out the way and told them face tha truth
The game ain't been the same without one of the best
But I'm back now tell em I ain't getting mood
I got sumthin to proof plus I'm the last hope that anything real
Tell em I won't lose
Got the world looking at me like I won't win
Tell em get up out the car cause I'm getting in
Fake niggas try'na walk without walk know these shoes made for the king
You ain't fitting in
Tell em I'm a survivor cause I survive everything that they told me would kill me
Plus I came out of the bottom I'm bonafide underground tell em they goin have to feel me
Ain't no way they denied me what was promised it was already accepted
I'm the chosen one in this battle just tell em to send em
I'm nothing less than what was Houston and I'm Houston still
Nothing less than Pimp if he was living bitch I'm something trill

[Hook: Brian Angel]

[Verse 3: Trae]
I refuse to let em forget so I'm pushing it to the limit
The king of this muthafucka exposing em for his end it
They know I do it for the city I never pretend it
Somebody tell em I'm still the key into these streets every section I tend it
Just as soon as I'm getting out of whatever it ain't nothin they can do
Bet tha Truth or can't nobody stop shit I was set to go
Going a long time waiting up hittin the show
But anytime either way I was set to slow
Taking out for my last role but I'm still on my last hope
I remember they shitted on my when we last spoke
So I'm leaving they ass smoke, so they hatin now
And I'm still in position to show em that nothin that they can do ever can lose me
And I'm never goin sell out to kick it cause nothin that they can do ever can use me
That's why I'm a general in these streets over soldiers and troops
One of the realest livin when you see me my nigga salute

Yea
Hol' Up
In the Ghetto
I can't tell you about you, but I can tell you something about me

[Verse 1 - Trae Tha Truth]
I got this chopper with me
Slidin' through the city, sippin something heavy
Fuck around and catch a body
Body me a nigga, tell them hoes steady
Ready for whatever, father helpful times
Many niggas outta line
Got a 40 pulled up to my waist
The other peace I need I couldn't find
[?] I could rewind it
Pain and hurt don't remind it
I'm fightin' knowin' nothin' promise
I'm close as hell but still can't time it
Just ridin' trying to make it home
That's real life, fuck this song
My sons know they daddy good
And they feel it so they call my phone
I can't answer, so I gotta pray
Shit I don't wanna die today
Fuck niggas might just try today
But I know I'll let a [?]
Forever in the hell hole
Go right beside your head hoe
I'm a asshole to the dissers
Tell them haters I say hello

[Chorus - Ink]
In the ghetto, some got hard on me
In the ghetto, only place I feel free
In the ghetto, livin' these ghetto dreams
In the ghetto, survive by any means

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
We live by any means
Forever, we gon' stand for some or fall for anything
Whenever we pull up get turnt up
Don't concern unless it plenty green
And Hennessy, we blowin' presidential Kennedy
Remember me I had a bomb in da cut
Had a Glock on my hip
Was trappin' the police pull up
No talkin' or hoppin' the fence
Fresh outta' jail gotta open case
I'm dodgin' prison but I'm trappin payin my probation
I know my mama wish I focused on my education
And I do too, but that ain't gon' get us off of Section 8
Know where we stay, no opportunity
See what they did to Freddie Gray they'd love to do to me
But I can't let them bitches play me, nu-uh

[Chorus - Ink]
In the ghetto, some got hard on me
In the ghetto, only place I feel free
In the ghetto, livin' these ghetto dreams
In the ghetto, survive by any means

[Verse 3 - Wyclef Jean]
Ghetto where I come from
Slumdog Millionaire slums
But we diamonds in the rough, son
We keep a 9 for protection, ay
And you can never judge me, cuz you never been there
In the middle of the night, when the enemies appear
Ghetto where we come from
Where death is not an option, tonight
Even though I said someone please call 911
Cops was too late
I had no time to wait
I'm at another wake
Another product face, lord

Trae the Truth, Lil' Boss, Black Buddafly yeah
We fin to do this one here for the ghetto, get at me

[Trae]
No matter what a nigga say, I'm gon be stuck in the game
Just like them 26 inch rims, stuck on the frame
I'm in the hood full time, I still kick it the same
And still got a nigga baby mama, giving me brain
I been the Truth since a youth, I fell in love with the streets
Like the body of the slab, fell in love with it's feet
I put the Cheve to the floor, and run it to the concrete
With a bitch in the back, head banging to the beat
Try to run up on a G, I'ma put a nigga to sleep
Plus the heat up under my seat, will make a nigga retreat
I'm a boss, fucking with me I promise you'll never eat
And if you wanna go to war, then I promise you getting beat
They know I been around the world, and brought it back to the hood
Threw a hook of diamonds on, and brought it back to the wood
Niggas stay in Hollywood, but I stay where I stood
And I'm gathered with them Assholes, up to no good

[Hook: Black Buddafly]
Welcome, to ghetto life (in the ghetto)
Welcome, to ghetto life
Streets are a daily life, (in the ghetto)
Welcome to ghetto, welcome to ghetto life

[Trae]
I hear them niggas with the truth, so I gaurntee nothing less
I do it for the hood, so it's nothing less than the best
G-code homie, and I'm here to keep it nothing less
And I'm from in the West, where it's nothing less than the best
Ghetto to the end, in a coupe like MJ
23 inches on a Cadillac, how a thug play
And what I'm packing, let em know don't get in a thug way
Any nigga can get it, coming to where I stay
I'm the truth in these streets, sitting in a black home
Front door and full of some'ing, black on some black chrome
I grind full time, till my money stack long
And I told you I was coming back, so it's back on
This here for the hood, and this here for the block
And the homies on the cell block, sitting on lock
Off top, when it come to the ghetto it don't stop
Number one in the hood, they be loving the way I rock

[Hook]

[Trae]
Ain't no need for the discussion, I'm the shit in the South
Any nigga saying different, bout to lose a tooth out his mouth
Niggas get flossed, I put it on the house
Keep playing with a G, a couple grand'll knock a nigga off
See I'm from the ghetto, where the drop top do's fly
Headed to the sky, with a dub when I fly by
Fo's swang wide, when I slide nigga no lie
Looking so live, heads turn when I roll by

(*talking*)
Can you see me now, yeah
We gon keep it hood, 24/7 mayn
But I'm doing this one here, for the ghetto
Welcome to it mayn
I'm bringing this, directly to your face
Trae the Truth

[Hook][talking]
This one here for the ghetto
A nigga ain't forgot about y'all
Everybody don't see shit the way we see it Knah i'm sayin
Shit they don't even feel it the way we do
That's why they don't respect it like that
But I'm here to let them know it's real in the field

[Verse 1 - Trae]
I'm from the section of the hood where all the ghetto is pain
And half the block don't even sleep cause they gon' pull a shurrane
Most of the shit remain the same and it ain't never gon' change
Tryna get it the way you know and keep the feds out of range
Alot of shit ends up the worse behind multiple reasons
Thought it was hell but know I feel like this is the season
So I bang the whole block today, non stop today
But I'm in all black strapped like the swat today
You never know-so I know I'm watchin everything close
Paranoia got me countless droppin anything close
I don't even know the reason shit happen the way it do
If your ghetto the same as mine, I know you feelin like I do
Maybe get it, the way I get it-when watchin ya homies die
And it ain't nothin you can do but just talk to e'm while you cry
And ask why he had to leave and move into another place
Then you stop and think about it cause he in a better place and it's fucked up!

[Hook-Shyna]
Everyday that I see-I pray to God that I breathe
Everywhere I go, my ghetto is-my ghetto is pain
Everyday that I try-I pray to God to get by
Everywhere I go, my ghetto is-my ghetto is pain

[Verse 2 - Trae]
I was always taught to watch my surroundings when up on the block
Glock cocked when I played the field, while niggas pitchin e'm rocks
Cops posted up in the jail house waitin for e'm to strike
But these bitches gon' have to catch us tonight
My lil'homie 'round the corner just got caught up for ten
The bad part is if he get free, he'll be at it again
I always told myself that if I made it in rap I'd come back for the hood
But I forgot these niggas up to no good
How the fuck I'm a help somebody, who ain't helpin they self
And at the same time wanna do you when they think you got wealth
Lord knows we up in the ghetto for most of our life
But I played it smart and got on my hustle for the rest of my life
And I don't need to shine so I take my time like snails
Cause ain't no feature finna be rappin from jail if you can't tell
I'm straight out of the section where ya partners will get ya
But would rather put this in the air, you better hope they don't hit ya-in the
Street life

So won't you ride with me...

You're all that I need...
Cause she my ghetto queen, I give her what she need
Money ain't a thing, she stay down like a G
Cause she my ghetto queen, I give her what she need
Money ain't a thing, she stay down like a G

[Hook: Lloyd]
Girl I done been around the globe

Everytime I call you be there for me
Baby girl I love you by my side
So anything you need, that means you got me
So just my ghetto queen gon' take that ride

[Trae]
Look here lil' mama, I'm gangsta, prolly nothin like you done delt with on the day to day
Some say that I'm a star, but in the hood I'm better known as Trae
I'm from around the way - where not too many make it out
And even if I did it's in my blood I'll never take it out
You say you got a man but I ain't tryna take his spot
I'm tryna be ya partna while I'm late night flippin on the block
So we can post up on this glass, tippin the Chevrolet
And get it, how we get it, then I'm gettin right back out ya way
I'm in my zone so all that drama you can leave at home
Ya man can lock you down, but me ain't nothin - rollin stone
And if you wanna chill tell his ass to leave you alone
Cause if he run up on me, I'm a run my fist upside his dome
Understand when I say I'm grown, and on that other shit
I'm tryna make a team but I ain't feelin all that lover shit
I'm tryna hit the lights and take it to you on that rubber shit
And keep it G, and leave it on that undercover shit

[Hook]

[Rich Boy]
Ay lay back with me, feel free lil'momma

Nigga through the Ferragamos, fuck the dumb hoes
And know that you'll ride with me baby fuck the popos
No pressure I ain't gotta test ya
I can leave you in my house with a hundred thousand on the dresser
Me and you - my beautiful bitch, so glamorous
So bad niggas pullin out they cameras
Together baby the world can't handle us
Hoes can't compete, no challengers
Summer time, we float on the boat
While I sip a lil'lean, and you puff a lil'smoke
I'm married to my money, but you could be my honey
The groupie bitches dump me - but I know that you love me
So on that note you can take this
Me and you be shinin harder then them diamonds on my wrist, M.O.B!

[Hook]

[Rich Boy]
We can ride in my drop and spend some money on some Fendi
You never ask what type of gold diggers try to get me
Them hoes are silly, but I pass 'em in the Hemi
If a mothafucker touch you - I'm a hit 'em with that semi
You down like my nigga, so you know I got yo'back
Anybody put they hands on you, I'm a lay 'em flat
So spread ya wings baby come on let's fly
I'm down with my lady till the day that I die

[Trae]
Say lil' mama what you waitin on - actin like you don't know no better
You say you tired of that shit, then roll with me and it's whatever
When in the presence of a gangsta don't worry I got ya
And fuck the stress, give me a sec - I'm a get that up out ya
So get ya spot I'm on the grind right now
I'm prolly less then two seconds away from shine right now
You can post up and be the bitch I'm tryna find right now
And if you can't see that I'm tha truth baby you blind right now, Yeah

[Hook][Intro: Chorus]

[Chorus: Till End][Chorus - Fat Pat sampled]

(Verse 1 - Trae)
I'm still in it homie,yeah I ain't never left
A couple more problems under my belt,got me pacin my steps
This year alone been enough to feel like my life ain't the same
Everybody watchin cause these haters keep callin my name
I thought it'd get greater when it come to fame
But all this roachin shit they put me thru'll have you smokin ya life away mayne
Still I don't blow at all - I choose to maintain
Cause whether I get high or not,my stress gon'be the same thing
Lord knows it ain't easy bein me,it ain't easy keepin it G
Knowin less then a day from now you ain't promised to see
I never light or roll it up,cause I can fight the pressure
Feelin' I was next watchin my brother H.A.W.K. lay on a stretcher
They same I'm crazy cause I never let my strain out
Everything stuck in my brain,done made it hard to take the stain out
Shit I do a song to take the pain out
And if I wasn't me I'd probably get a sack and try to blow my brains out

[Chorus - Trae + Fat Pat]
Lord knows if I couldn't maintain
And I wasn't use to goin head up with pain
Then I'd probably be gettin high
If they ain't never introduce me to fame
Or send my ass to live my life in the rain
Then I'd probably be gettin high
Stress got a nigga sittin low
And if I ain't know what I was livin fo'
Homie I'd probably be gettin high
Lord knows I'd probably be gettin high

(Verse 2 - Trae)
I'm in my zone now,everything feel wrong now
For the first time in a long time I'm on my own now
My life gon'always be realer then most of these folks
They never understand what I be watchin inside of these locs
It's hard to determine why people around ya
Knowin the real reason they come around,ain't for love or to kick it around ya
I take it slow and live it one day at a time
And blow my thoughts out with this pen,instead of dro to ease a nigga mind
That ain't no knock on gettin high homie
But I choose to live my life and kick it sober,checkin niggas who get fly homie
I watch my surroundings like my surroundings watchin me
Stayin fo'steps ahead of e'm,and drop e'm if they blockin me
Yeah it ain't easy but I'm known to hold it down
I seen my partna Shy brother leave home and he still ain't been found
It's been two years but still we fight to never lay it down
And pray he don't get caught,or have to put his people underground

[Chorus - Trae + Fat Pat]
Lord knows if I couldn't maintain
And I wasn't use to goin head up with pain
Then I'd probably be gettin high
If they ain't never introduce me to fame
Or send my ass to live my life in the rain
Then I'd probably be gettin high
Stress got a nigga sittin low
And if I ain't know what I was livin fo'
Homie I'd probably be gettin high
Lord knows I'd probably be gettin high[Chorus - H.A.W.K.]
I would give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back - matter of fact bring the whole crew back
Give my - give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back - matter of fact bring the whole crew back
I would give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back - matter of fact bring the whole crew back
Give my - give my last breathe - Give my, give my last breathe
Give my - give my last breathe if I could bring you back

[Verse 1 - Trae]
H.A.W.K. I feel like I'm lonely homey, I need to talk
So ask Jesus if I can see for a second - so we can take a walk
It's like alot done changed since we kicked it the night befo
I feel I lost it all but still got a part of my life to go(damn)
And just to let you know I'm livin it up to make you proud
That's why I represent and I scream it everytime I touch a crowd(yeah)
I'm Screwed Up Click forever, no doubt I'm a rep it like ya
Holdin it for Screw - maybe show the rest I'm gon step it like ya
Sometimes I feel I should've never got that call
And when I made it to the scene it's like my spirit took a fall
I was the last to leave the place where they found you, I couldn't breath at all
Sometimes I wake up feelin like why the fuck should I breath at all

(Chorus - H.A.W.K.)

[Verse 2 - Trae]
Nobody can tell you bout pain - the way I can tell you bout pain
Watchin ya partna family suffer's enough to blow out ya brains
Everyday it be the same thing prayin that I can hold on
And I swear to life, you gon live thru this partna everytime I roll on
One hundred is what you was, keepin it real - like a few dubs
That's why you in the same category that me and Screw was
I remember you stayin down with me in my time of need
And on my son I got Josh and Corade for whatever they need
And if I lose my life I'm a rider, say Hawk another niggas try
But still I had to be stronger that's why I didn't cry
I pray you got to Heaven, and I feel it when I look up in the sky
I told you, you my brother forever - homey I didn't lie

[Chorus - H.A.W.K.]

[Verse 3 - Trae]
I use to never understand when you hurtin why life go on
I guess cause they ain't never tell me that life it self is wrong
I would give my last breathe if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back, matter of fact bring the whole crew back
And if we never see each other I love you and that's a fact
And tell Pac I'm holdin it down, and chunk the duece for me to Pat
I ain't gon never switch it up Hawk I'm ridin this one out
And to the devil I'm the truth that's why he hidin this one out
I feel my body had to fight to mark yo casket to the grave
No matter how it went I never thought that I'd put you in the grave
I do this here for you and yo'momma, yo wife, and yo kids
Frasier to John homey, I got you that's what it is

[Chorus Till End]Chorus (Exerpt from Swang (Big Hawk))
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
Give my-give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
Give my-give my last breath
Give my-give my last breath
Give my-give my last breath
If I could bring you back
Verse 1 (Trae)
H-A-W-K I feel like I'm lonely homie I need to talk
So ask Jesus can I see you a second so we can take a walk
It's like a lot done changed since we kicked it the night before
I feel I lost it all and still got a part of my life to go
And just to let you know I'm livin' it up to make you proud
That's why I represent and I scream it everytime I touch a drought
I'm Screwed Up Click forever no doubt I'ma rep it like ya
Holdin' it for Screw makin' sure the rest of us step it like ya
Sometimes I feel I shoulda never got that call
And when I made it to the scene it's like my spirit took a fall
I was the last to leave the place where they found you I couldn't breathe at all
Sometimes I wake up feelin' like why the f*** should I breathe at all
Chorus
Verse 2 (Trae)
Nobody can tell you 'bout pain the way I can tell you 'bout pain
Until your partner's family suffers enough to blow out your brains
Everyday it be the same thing prayin' that I can hold on
And I swear to life you gon' live through this partner everytime I roll on
One hundred is what you was keepin' it real like a few does
That's why you in the same category that me and Screw was
I remember you stayin' down with me in my time of need
And yo my son I got charged that can rob for whatever they need
And if I lose my life say Hawk I'm a rider other n****z didn't try
You was there you never left to be stronger that's why I didn't cry
Pray you got to heaven and I feel it when I look up in the sky
I told you you my brother forever homie I didn't lie
Chorus
Verse 3 (Trae)
I used to never understand when you hurtin' why life go on
I guess cuz they ain't never tell me that life in itself is wrong
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact
Bring the whole crew back
And if we never see each other I love you and that's a fact
And tell Pac I'm holdin' it down and chunk the duece from me to Pat
I ain't gon' never switch you up Hawk I'm ridin' this one out
And tell the devil I'm the truth that's why he hidin' this one out
I feel my body had to fight to walk your casket to the grave
No matter how it went I never thought that I'd put you in the grave
I would do this here for you and your momma, your wife and your kids
Frasier to John homie I got you that's what it is
Chorus

(Trae over chorus)
H-A-W-K
Yo this really get hard for me right here homie

Mobbin' down MLK[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Sitting, fighting this pressure in the state of exhaust
How many times I talked to God, speaking on those that I lost
A couple brother, couple sisters then a bunch of my homies
That's why I move up out my lonely, hoping God'll come show me
A new direction cause I feel like I'm losing faith by the minute
Tryna hide away from reality in something that's tinted
I conversate most of the time across the mind of a seal
Same niggas that showed me love, you might just find em in hell
I hate to see us, or to blame em on everything they been through
In a different circumstance a better life, they might just been you
Tryna provide, missing homicide by minutes
Or they tryna get stripes from a basic Sargent to lieutenant
I do this here for my nigga Dawg, my nigga Clip
Ain't too many others that are sold, that's why I trip
I trip out, but try to keep my cool knowing pain is here
Wanted the sun, but since I missed this shit the rain is here

[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
Abnormal heart, diagnosed at birth
All my niggas got em whole family cursed
T-shirt with their nan just ain't the same
Shoulda have em attack out all the stress and strain
Fuck this fame and this change
Fuck this chain and this Range
With all my real ones gone I can't sleep the same
I wish this fuckin rain' would go away

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Lost is what I feel, looking at where I'm headed
Talked to God begging for help so much I feel like I'm out of credit
He don't know me and I understand, I just need a helping hand
Talked to my grandfather day later, now we on the sand
The homie calls mama's stress
And even though he gone, he still around so yeah we blessed
It's a cold world
They say it get better but I just save the drama tired
From all the pain the I acquired, left the Devil fired
I swear it's life to end the days
Of tryna make it out but I can't get up out this maze
It's me against the world and I can't get up out this phaze
Niggas jumping fly like they can't get up out them J's
I'm on my defence
May my sons forgive me, I don't wanna be no failure
But being real throughout the pain, it hurt like hell I tell ya
It's hard to see when you're surrounded by the dark
It's that type of shit that take ya air support
For real mayne

[Hook][Verse 1:]
Cheeah, nothing promise so I kick it like I'm bout to leave
Fighting pressure got me practicing my barb and weave
I deal with hate like love is something that I don't believe
Nothing less than thankful tryna cherish everyday I breathe
Street nigga, hood credit nigga nothing cash
Unless I'm in the hood stunting with my nothing ass
Paparazzi on em look at all these flashing lights
Outta control something like a pilot who was crash at flight
Seven letter certified by the sender
I bring the hood to any section I enter, and that they better remember
They tell me smile but in they no mind DJ
One of my brothers gone away till November
Until then I'm goin be...

[Verse 2:]
Lil homies on the corner askin what the buisness?
I say the struggle knowing haters praying that I'm finished
They rather superman but radio say he's a menace
When others left the hood these stay to catch perfect attendants
Word on the street messing with Trae it could lose your career
Yeah that might be true the pussy niggas who living in fear
Fuck em, seeing it close something they wouldn't using
This day eviction note is tell them niggas keep it moving
The sound in my trunk is atomic, speakers plexing
And I'm slippin on this Challenger glass see on reflection
And I'm pose through anger management, swangers so much aggression
Even wise over stretching like crazy
No direction...

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm in this old school nobody but me in the car
I fin em slumps try'na duck off from being a star
Call it an asshole state of mind
So I do clarity at this watch under these rocks to display the time
Half of that inside the grill or say I'm doin fine
I know these haters hot as fuck to see me doin mine
They tell me focus on the day, I only see at night
In this black locs try'na stop the world from being bright
Cheeah, till the casket I'm the realist in it
I guess they never got the message so I'm here to send it
I'm on they ass until the world understand me
I try to tell em ain't no way they can ban me
Picture me rollin I'm...

[Hook x2]Check it, check it, check it...

[Chorus: B.I.G. sample]
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up

[Verse 1 - Trae]
I grew up a screw up to the best of my knowledge
I continue through out the streets, can't tell you shit about college
I chose my own path on a lonely road - to try an get paid
And pray to God me and my niggas will never have to lay in no grave
I never got to be like Mike, cause I ended up like my brother
Livin crazy in these streets, but an angel around my mother
Fascinated by the light in the night, and the money, and hoes
The clothes, and all the whips, and the diamonds - while they swangin on 4's
I got my first gun, headed for my first lick
My nigga switched it up and he was headed for his first brick
Either way that it went, we both was gon'try an get paid
And wasn't no way in hell they was gon'stick me with minimum age
It ain't take but thirty - seconds to make up my mind
And it took me by the dirt, and that took the side that I had to shine
And I was gon'get it whether it was legal or crime
I had to get a piece even if it lead me to doin some time

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Trae]
Whether they like it or not this rappin done got me settled
Every since a youth I hit the gas, with my weight on the pedal
Dinkie told me this gon'be my ticket to leave the hood
And when they see me now these niggas know it's all good
I ain't finna let shit get in my way, it took me a second to get here
I'm the champion of the streets, so it's understood I'm a sit here
Lord knows how many fuck ups, it took for me to get here
It's only room for one, all you extra niggas can't fit here
Even if I was a screw up - I turned out bein' a ghetto star
With a teacher's salary invested inside of my ghetto car
I guess it ain't all that bad to be who I am
I'd do it all again just to show these niggas 'bout who I am(nigga)

[Chorus]

[Trae]
Well I guess growin up a screw up, ain't all that bad huh
Mothafuckers told a nigga - he wasn't gon'be shit
Them hoes still doin the same mothafuckin thing nigga
I'm movin round this bitch, five mothafuckin whips
Takin care of my mothafuckin son, my mothafuckin'gang
And everything I represent, yeah if I had to do this shit all over again
I wouldn't change a mothafuckin thing mayne - Trae Tha Truth, yeah[Sample "Pimp Tha Pen" x3: Lil Keke]

If it's going down, I bet'cha get screwed up
Ya to dead to the King Of The Streets lil homie slow it down, I ain't really try'na move fast
My old school got me looking like a OG, everybody looking at me like they never seen glass
I'm the leader of the A.B.N. representers
And a gutta when these rappin' niggas never inna
Ya better get up out the game if you a beginner
Somebody finna get robbed if I ain't a winner
First bitch caught slippin' a running a binner
I wanna win it like I'm here finna get back
Trunk up by the fist will sit back
Leaving through the hood like I'm going off a six pack
Real talk I am the H
And tell them niggas I'm a fan of hatred
Probably hate mo ways you see a bitch with a classic shape
Trunk beatin' like it masturbate
I got a couple niggas mad, tell them I ain't finna pass the plate
I finna know that they ass is fake
So tell them goin' give it up, I ain't finna pass the mic for shit
And I ain't leaving till this bastard pray

Big paper stacker, money I was after
Froze to adapter, foods time diner
Waiting on the jagger everything is so slow
Moving all of my dews, player so I get choose
We ain’t loving no hoes hustling full time
Slow time down, these ain’t no fools
Swinging like I’m going craz
RIP to fair play got myself on my ass

Shorty keep it hood
Riding' shotgun while I'm thugging

No tripping cause she know we just fucking (ooooh)
That's my gutta chick
Down to do what whatever, whatever (ooooh)
She's my gutta chick
Down to do what whatever, whatever

[Rich Boy Verse 1]
I told the girl rewind it, she always like to ride it
I zip it up and hide it but she always come and find it
My pimping pop a playa, just politics and paper
And I position it for me
Come here ladies let me see
I'm a dog, and bitch I ball in the rain
And the big kush gon chevy on some motherfucking things
Show me that you love me, girl come and suck me
If I let you in my door to see the dick
Then you lucky' thats my main boose bottom bitch
I gave her dame and some dick
Damn, how she swallow it
Damn, how she polish it
Damn after I buss
She right back on the top of it (huh) (yeah) (aye)
Ain't no stopping it
Every night she ride it right pussy gripping super tight
When she can't get me on the phone she want to pussy fight
Could it be? What we doing wrong girl if its feeling strong?
Face sinking in the pillow gripping in pillow holding on harder!

[Hook]

[Trae Tha Truth Verse 2]
So I turned up with this hood bitch
Late night on these backstreets
Audition in the take pipe, ass out on my backseat
It ain't nothing like me I show her for real
Tell her to sit it off then I tell her to chill
Put under the spotlight when I show her the grill
Mike Vick on that ass, got me running' the field
Can't equip the pipe, tell her I need a fix
Four in the morning, got her ass doing tricks
DJ Trae about to put it in the mix
Crack her ass open then throw in a couple chicks
You never know might even star in a couple flicks
Let go, made over rapping a couple bricks
Real shit, what I'm on is so sick
How to shape swag ass to thick
C thru dress, everything else missing
She know about to hit it when I get in position
Telling me go down, that's what she wishing
But I ain't eating shit less it come out the kitchen
You can call me Truth Hefner yeah i go hard
You wear who ass out?, bitch I go hard
Put you in time out for a couple of days
Got the headboard beating like a couple of cars
Stroke game top rank like a couple of stars
Like something i spit for a couple of bars
Yea, truth or real, spaceship looking like it's fresh off mars
And you may not wanna miss it if it take off
One hell of a ride, all brakes off
It should've been a warning or something
The way she got a nigga tryna fuck her face off

[Twista Verse 3]
When I look at her I can see she from the hood
So thick and her eyes so red
I heard that she got that good
And if you got a bottle then them thighs goin spread
It ain't never that she a ho
But she'd be fucking' with a real nigga when he come through
Got it laid out for me with a buddy on her side
Just in case I wanna fuck with her too
After the Nicki Minaj, and sticky massage
You see it was a tricky mirage
And if you feel sad cause she a stone cold killa
You ain't never really gotta call her pretty, she hot
She hold them thangs and if it's drama and we really need the tool
She know how to control them thangs
And stay ever ready to bust
Bagging up work and smoking good
But she really want roll and bang
Her Appetite for destruction, it's prevalent
She good and hard but don't try to play her cause of her elegance
Never let feelings start developing
Though she got some good head she still like the dead president
Put your ass in the box, bad but a chick
Still a gutta chick what a chick they'll show you how to cut a brick
Run a lick so succulent
Stuck 'em for a fit then stick 'em for a shit
Who you fucking with?

[Hook]

[Too Short Verse 3]
I think I'm Hugh Hefner, I'm Charlie Sheen
I fuck these hoes then I hardly see 'em
She's 19, I'm older than her father was
He in the pin though so he don't bother us
I'm her daddy now and she be getting down
My little gangsta bitch, I found her in the town
She got a pretty face, kinda grimy mayne
If I tell her get it, she gon find them things
And bring 'em to me, make her daddy proud
You could fuck her if you cash her out
But don't fall asleep next to my bitch
Cause if you do, she gon take a lot of shit
I rise her well, I taught 'er how to rob a trick
Take a balling nigga and hit a lick
She's a gutta bitch, she's from the hood
But I don't like square bitches so it's all good

[Hook]
[Too Short talking][Trae]
I been repping and running the block, since the age of my youth
A gangsta guerilla go-getter, certified as a troop
I done had it with niggas, the only thing that I'm bringing is plex
Got me feeling like Kobe Bryant, dumping off eight repping the West
Get off of me homie, cause I've been known to click on the cool
I'm a damn fool, and ain't no games fin to be played with the tool
I'm sick, and I bet you niggas just don't want it with Trae
Cause if I pull it I'ma spray, and put a slug in your vertebrae
Maabing you bitch niggas, better get out the zone
Or else you fin to see me make my slugs, get out the chrome
When that Mack get to spitting, you gon get out your home
I'm sick of telling you bitch niggas, to get the fuck on
I mean it, you motherfuckers better play your positions
Respect the code of the streets, before your bitch ass be missing
Or slid up under some'ing swoll up, and blacked out
Better give me fifty feet, 'fore I make your lights out

[Hook]
I done had enough, of you niggas
Eyes wide open, I ain't trusting you niggas
Me and Lil' Trae, bout to bust on you niggas
Prepare for the worst of the worst, when I'm rushing you niggas
(I done had enough, of you niggas
Eyes wide open, never trusting you niggas
Me and Mack Biggers, bout to bust on you niggas
Load the clip finna trip when I'm rushing you niggas, had enough of you
Niggas)

[Mack Biggers]
I done had enough of you fake cats, faking the Maab
Now I plan on taking your job, or breaking you off
Taking the chips and breaking your jaw, flaming your car
With cop killers, when invading your yard
That's just a taste of the Maab, Mack Biggers was shot but I saved the bomb
And when I squeeze, only Jesus can save you boy
Now what y'all know, about banging and rob
Or going state to state, slanging it raw
See me I play no games, and say no names
And I'm sick and tired of you niggas, that play hoe games
Y'all so close to being dames, so if I say your name
Best believed it's a bullet aiming, at your brain
From the streets to the Penn, nigga respect my gangsta
Even when I'm draped in flames, with the best of the bangers
And only cop killers, rest in the chamber
I done had enough of you niggas, see y'all messing with danger

[Hook]

[Trae]
I'm sick of you niggas, you bout to get me back in the stage
Of whipping a nigga ass to the flo', and dumping slugs out the gauge
Why these niggas don't understand, that it be real in the field
Disrespecting my gangsta ways, will be enough to get you killed
I got killas on every corner, guerillas ready to mob
If you try me thinking I'm playing, I bet I'll get to the job
You walking a thin line, old cake ass nigga
Plus I had it up to here, with all you fake ass niggas

[Mack Biggers]
What y'all know about Mack Biggers, and Trae the Guerilla Maab
And the Planet of the Apes, invading the planet of the fakes
Bout to test a nigga stamina, with a K
Bound to catch a slug dog, if you standing in the way
We could do it for my nigga Charge, or we can do it for Dinkie
Regardless of the fact, we gon leave you nigga stinking
And if you survive the ride, we gon leave you niggas thinking
Whenever we around dog, it's best you stop blinking

[Hook - 2x][Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I'm in this kitchen getting money, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I'm on this block counting money, hallelujah
Hallelujah (x7)
I'm in this bitch getting money, hallelujah
I'm in this bitch getting money, hallelujah

[Verse 1: Jay'Ton]
They call me Jay'Ton for a fucking reason
Cause I keep them tons each and every season
Cross me or mines, you no longer breathing
Keep a ton of guns just give me a reason
I swear God its time to [?] these niggas
They playing stiff but I ain't believe in these niggas
Brick talk, bitch I swear I been feeding these niggas
50 in this chopper time for relieving these niggas
Kingpin living, got these bitches choosing
If you want them cheaper prices gots to come to Houston
Sets is where I'm from, we wrap it up and ship it
So much work in diesel trucks it ain't no way to lift it
I'm in this kitchen, come place your order
If I ain't got it at the trap, I got it at the border
Born in that valley, next to my connect
To deep in this vette, just me and that check

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
When you get money say Illuminati
Looking like a white angel, a white Rarri
Hallelujah, I believe in God
Take a brick soft and stretch it, I believe in hard (work)
Amen hallelujah
I can make this shit ugly, Freddy Krueger
Hustle Gang, hustle numbers
Got arrange kush prices that's hooked on chronic
Dirty money, I ain't talking Diddy
I got kiloads of heroin in the holy city
Amen, cross the plug
Went off with the packers he one showing love
Fuck em I ain't paying more
Pull up in my hood, bitch you getting robbed
Niggas allows about the money and nothing matters
My family and niggas and you come after

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
I woke up in this Phantom too lost to remember
So been trying a to play with snow like the month of December
In this kitchen with the work, whipping chickens for dinner
If I ain't trapper of the year, I’m the perfect contender
King Truth, white knights
My connect got so much action I'm like with the price
White lips slide through these bright lights
I keep a heater, everything on me covered in ice
I’m on this white sand maybe somewhere lost in Cuba
And I keep a shooter that'll disappear ya like Bermuda
So many chains hanging off young Truth I should’ve been a jeweler
This bitch I got ain't dropping off the truth sure no schooler
Ain't shit as real as me, [?]
Get money way to much to count, [?]
I’m all bricks, gold hands, this work stretch, no rubber bands

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth][Hook]
You wanna get me for this money, I say no
I can't worry about you haters, gotta grind and get my buck
So God, give me a halo, and I made it, though
When the sun low, I pray to God, give me a halo and I made it, though
When the sun is low

[Verse 1]
In the fast, I get my 

I done been up in this bitch way too long
Thinking I ain't getting none of your shit
It ain't nothing that I want I won't go get

I'm the king of whatever, I say it again
You niggas nothing in the game so play it again
Got my eyes on the prize, away in the wind
You niggas lost already, I'm waiting to win
I got my aim on, tryna get a new sight
Haters know the truth so I'm here to get on new sights

you don't like me 'cause I'm probably something you not
Your hustle cool but see my hustle greener
Hate the stubborns, see, I love the haters
They don't fuck with me and I don't fuck with them
I get a bitch, I let her play with this paper

I need the hate low while I run this paper

[Hook]
You wanna get me for this money, I say no
I can't worry about you haters, gotta grind and get my buck
So God, give me a halo, and I made it, though
When the sun low, I pray to God, give me a halo and I made it, though
When the sun is low

[Verse 2]
Can't quit so I know I gotta finish now
I need a halo, father can't see me now


I'm too real to be, I'm too real to be
You ain't real as me
How you figure that, how you figure that

yeah, I gotta get this money, can't lose focus

I shine for real so every one of them notice
Got no bricks, how you niggas gonna stop it?
Hating on me better try to get a profit
If it ain't that, what the fuck is you doing?
Keep playing, I'mma pull a broke nigga outta pocket

hunting for the green like a savage

[Hook]
You wanna get me for this money, I say no
I can't worry about you haters, gotta grind and get my buck
So God, give me a halo, and I made it, though
When the sun low, I pray to God, give me a halo and I made it, though
When the sun is low[Talking - Trae]
You know I never did understand
Why they always told me to smile
Shit it ain't too much shit out here to smile fo'
Real talk - you know it's still Assholes By Nature, peep game

[Verse 1 - Trae]
I remember comin up labeled the lil'nigga
Watchin niggas fuck over they own, but see I kept it realer
But bein real ain't always what niggas make it to be
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Pennitentaries and life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcome
Somethin say to pray, and try to do my best to understand he right around the way
I got a call from Mr.Rogers just the other day - telling me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin bout - until he told me Loinna died
It fucked me up so much I couldn't even go the wait
But if her family call I'm a make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The mo'people I love, the mo'they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God alittle mo'then a pastor
Probably to live and make sure my son never become a basterd
I never been the one to quit, I always been a leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I knew it was this I'd never took the time to meet her
So I feel the frown across my face, the only way to greet her
In the process of bein'Trae, I missed out as a child
Probably because reality my style
And they told my cousin death before he's thirty after checkin his file
He damn near twenty - eight so how the fuck am I suppose to smile?

[Talking - Styles P]
I don't know my nigga, I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I suppose to smile?
Life's real over here, you know

[Verse 2 - Styles P]
Styles don't smile, the hood too foul
The lil'niggas is wild, man lost trial
Hit e'm with some numbers he ain't even gon'chow
He ain't even sleepin, he been thinkin 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for awhile
Same bullshit tryna get you a money pile
We all see the reefer, or the kill - doors locked
I keep the tech with the air hose cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot, but Paniro's not
Gon'fuck with these fuck niggas I air those blocks
It's real hard to sleep, when it's money on the mind
Murder on the mind, puffin on a dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody's mom cryin, cause somebody's boy dyin
It's the same ole shit, from the wait to the funeral same ole trip
Crack money, rap money the same ole grip
Ask Trae could I smile out in Texas, livin wreckless
Said the cops gon'get you and niggas'll leave you breathless
Shit I'm a winner, mo'like a sinner
Tryna make it to dinner - then live after breakfast

[Talking - Styles P]
You know, Trae - S.P
How the fuck are we suppose to smile?
Nigga answer me that
And maybe I'll fuckin smile, you know[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I’m feeling like I’m fly as fuck, no planes
Yelling where them haters at, ain’t nothing changed
Still talking white bricks, cocaine
In the club with one hundred racks, I’m just saying
Yeah bitch I might
(Hold up(x6) Yeah)(x2)

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I’m just saying, hold up
California ‘rari bitch top just fold up
Nigga with an attitude Michael Kors polo
Top’ll get to popping  make them freeze up like a photo
Nightmares about the feds smelling like Hermes
Black with a check now you Cortez
The exorcist nigga  when I roll it turn heads
Put some Ninas ‘til they  froze like staring at Medusa hair
You see me in these streets on these beats
With them hoes of the kitchen
A pussy nigga think different pussy nigga tripping
It’s Jizzle from the bottom  die a legend out this bitch
I get to whipping up that fo’ and get a seven out that bitch

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
King of the streets, it’s when it drops I’m startin’
Bitch I ball for the city just like my last name Harden
So much green inside the trunk it should’ve stayed in the garden
All I do is pay the price  never ask what they charging
I pull up on your bitch and repossess her like you owe that
Put her in a flick and  display her like she was Kodak
King motherfucker I’m classic like I was throwback
This ain’t what you want pussy nigga, you better know that
Too deep in this ‘rari, something blowing like Bob Marley
Hit my youngin’ with a chopper Tell him ride like Harley
I do this for my niggas in the city of the slow shit
Well they pulled up and they bang something
Them laws come we don’t know shit
Street nigga problems, we don’t never duck ‘em
I’m an asshole, Trae forever young  and fuck ‘em
Nuts hanging to the point it ain’t no where to stuff ‘em
I let my chain play nigga, I don’t ever tuck ‘em

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Jays in the yard, Ki’s in the kitchen
AKs’ in the closet a quarter million in the ceiling
All the yay we distributing  no wonder how they never caught me
All I gotta say is pay your taxes  pay your lawyer fee
Think im runnin’ round a nigga, I know the mayor I can call it
Yeah that’s above the law call it what you call it
Don’t take no shit  ’cause I ain’t no toilet
See me shawty you see me ballin’!
I pulled up, hopped out sharp as shit
Rolls Royce so big  can’t park the shit
You ain’t ’bout that life  quit startin’ shit
Cause we ain’t gon’ wanna hear that "I'm sorry" shit

Top down on the coupe, bitches askin who is he?
Gudda Gudda bitch the name rangin every city
Real nigga music they talk it I doos it
All about the money so the track I abuse it
Been drankin all day, I done dunked the whole cruiser
Name a nigga better, the place I'm right in front of me
I lay em face down in the street right in front of me
Gun to his back bullets coming out the front
Make examples outta niggas cause he shouldn't of never front on me
Miserable niggas and misery loves company
I keep a two neen's in the shoutgun company
Young Money, ABN that's the mob
We take it old money don't quit'cha day job
Nigga!

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Tippin inside some hood shit, beating my life away
Four in the morning thuggin can't get seen in the light of day
Terrorizing the city tell em I got the right of way
A nigga jump outta place and I collect with a righter way
This burner like the trip it might end up taking yo waist off
So bullets show direction like Wayne blowing yo face off
They throw and hit your block with this chopper and fuck ya place off
Have a ticket to the district attorney to blow the case off
I'm on this street shit, riding like a renegade
Wrist something refresher stones same color lemonade
You be stupid to think to run up on me
Bitch I got niggas bigger than Shaq outta dressing me as they big homie
Neither of them Asshole niggas I know you heard about em
And even on this 6 foot 6 won't get a word about em
Bitch I'm above my cash, money like Dwayne Carter
ABN and Young Money damn it ain't a team harder

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Fresh off the plane from La Guardia
Jae Millz
Time wait for no man so if you got no plan
Ya might as well get some steel toes and kick coke cans
You can be a had not my choice if ya wanna
But my choice is to go hard New V for the summer
Nigga I'm a hustla dead president's hunter
And for them dead presidents I'll hunt ya, I'll slump ya
Won't second guess I won't wonder
I let off that Kevin Durant feel the thunder!
MAAAH! Get the fuck up out my way boy ya ought too
A broke conversation I'm the wrong one to talk too
I talk money and my money yeah it talk too
Just drove something dumb out the dealership off walk-toos
Both wrists froze bitch and I'm never shook
A one way vacation I'll get em booked
The ticket charge free put it on me
Matta fact YME is Millz Trae and double G
That's murda
Fuck with it nigga
Uh-huh
Yeah(*talking*)
The root of all evil, is every man's downfall
Caught up in that street life, know I'm tal'n bout
I remember that G shit, had a nigga doing crazy ass shit
Can't forget that , I remember that shit like it was yesterday for real

[Trae]
Remember me, like I was FED time
The only thing that I knew, to live my life was doing crime
Even as a young nigga, all I ever wanted was to shine
The root of evil, kept gorillas living like we was blind
For the cash for the shine for the do', we was busting shots
And doing 85 in the hood, running from the cops
With Lil Shae and B.J., trying to bring the click to the top
And deep inside, I knew the streets would never let us out
I don't want no plex, but if you did then I would blast for mine
I don't want no cell, but if I get caught up I'm gon do my time
A real nigga forever for the good for the bad, never happy forever sad
Pee-Wee doing twenty agg'd, so I'm on my pen and my pad
Now look at everything that I've done, trying to live lavish
I'm sick of living life broke on the edge, and trying to manage
You got my brother in the Penn, for three with a L
You happy thinking it was love, but a nigga could never tell for the money

[Hook - 8x]
How could you, do this to me

[Dougie D]
This is the situation, and everything is looking so crazy
And I can't even take it, baby mama blame can't handle my baby
Tripping acting shady, when she the one that fucked up the family
But since the fact I'm a playa, Dougie slide right through the plexing
You know what it is, put this on everything I feel
Everything that I love, and everything that I live
Making my feddy want my money, and watching on whammies
Can't be tripping with the bullshit, because the bullshit is petty
I'm rocking this steady, and I deal what I do working jelly
Always on my P's and Q's, watching out for the federalies
Mash for my funds, Dougie D gotta try to get done
If it's hell or the highway fuck it, I'm cooking then bud
Constantly on my grind, busting my ass to feed my kid
Since them things, that I g ive my baby mama ain't like a bitch
It's enough I'm dealing with the laws, and it's enough I'm dealing with the niggas
Please don't create a mad man, fuck around and have all y'all singing

[Hook - 8x]

[Z-Ro]
I use to wonder how and why, my life was bad
Wanted to be anything, except like my dad
My apple fell far from the tree, straight out of the yard
Raising myself among strangers, living on boulevards
Gang related, nah just for fortune or fame
Because they know me by the Z-Ro, plus they know me by my first name
Picture me rolling, in my Dodge in traffic
I got no love for these niggas, so keep your groupie ass stepping
I can determine the real and the fake, don't make me ball up a pause
And punch a motherfucker's grill off his face
Case after case but it ain't slowing me down
See y'all ain't know me at first, I bet y'all knowing me now
So when my trigga fly a nigga die, I ain't playing no games
And fuck this North and South shit, cause I ain' t stating no claim
I ain't bring it with me, and I can't take it when I go
To the world, listen at what you did to me when I flow

[Hook - 16x](Chorus - Lil' Keke)
How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me

(Verse 1 - Trae)
R.I.P to H.A.W.K., so I swang a bumpa grill
Made it out the hood, but I'm in the hood still
Leather so soft, yeah I like the way it feel
Hoppin out fresh like I signed a million dollar deal
Yeah I'm the truth - 84's sittin on the truck
Haters on my nuts, while I'm ridin' with a Cuban slut
Or I can do the drop, trunk up - fifth ain't
Doors hoppin fly, while I'm sittin on some sick paint
Customized off Johhny yo shit ain't
Nose in the air, actin like my shit don't stank
I'm the King of the streets so I'm top rank
Bitch I'm from the West and I can roam where ya block can't
I walk nice so my whip stay shoe'd up
Beatin so hard it'll make ya throw ya food up
A.B.N still red, black, or blue'd up
And we don't wanna hear it - if it never been Screwed Up

(Chorus - Lil' Keke)

(Verse 2 - Big Pokey)
Me I'm all about the cash, cause I love grindin
Labels want me to cut 'em something, like a blood diamond
Two stacks in my hand at the club climbin
Popped the band, made it rain - now the club drownin
Use to drop niggas, now I let the snub down him
Leave 'em in the parkin lot and let the club find him
75 corners in the bezzell, yeah the bulb blindin
Diamonds the size of dice, cause I love shinin
They mad at me 'cause I'm livin the life
Paper'd up, taper'd up - in this linen - and - ice
Hot like the dice, make a chick look twice
It cost to floss dogg I done paid that price
Money come, money go - point scene money gone
52 out the door now a nigga money long
Niggas know the deal - stop, drop, and roll
Niggas know the fuckin dreal, you know who it is

(Chorus Till End - Lil' Keke)[Chorus: Ink]
I ain't mad at ya, doin what you gotta do
I ain't mad at ya, standin home at the school
I ain't mad at ya, mouths to feed, and bills to pay
I ain't mad at ya, it's gonna be a better day

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
What's been happenin with you, homie, you look like you been stressin
Tryna make change, but not excepted is what I'm guessin
The ones you love the most not there, you gotta listen
Devil playing quarterback in the simptoms of bliss
Know that Bentley you had from 9 to 5 in the hood got you locked up
Used to run the block, but now half the block got shot down
Baby all the way, it's gonna be fucked up if you don't grind
Dreams to fly away, but that ain't work, so you got crime
On top of that, I hear you thinkin bout goin to school
And pick up on things that aren't bout a pack and a tool
I feel you, lil homie
Whatever the best for you, that's what you gotta do, homie
Hold you down, gonna support you, ain't no doubt about it
When you crash, I'm the first to say you ain't bout it
Funny situation, but it's up to you to hop out it
Lead the way like it's real, just hope he don't forget bout it

[Chorus: Ink]
I ain't mad at ya, doin what you gotta do
I ain't mad at ya, standin home at the school
I ain't mad at ya, mouths to feed, and bills to pay
I ain't mad at ya, it's gonna be a better day

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Being wreckless never was you, who am I to judge
Know this shit ain't easy for you, what it does to ya
You never had intentions on switchin, just tryna fix it
Buildin yourself to get back in the mix
I ain't mad at ya, I heard you got a girl
Now you wanna lock it down, even if it mean other women won't come back around
I was comin here to see you standin on your own two
What's the point of livin, when what you livins not you
I heard you was in Holliwood, cause you got off the corner
But you know that if you take that back again, you's a goner
It's number three when they see you, you goin ride it out
You don't remember all them nights of pain, you cried it out
I'm blastin the ox, never missin these stops
Opertoonity knocks, gonna get out the box
Iether way, I'm still proud of ya
You still fightin, homie
When they doubted ya, homie

[Chorus: Ink]
I ain't mad at ya, doin what you gotta do
I ain't mad at ya, standin home at the school
I ain't mad at ya, mouths to feed, and bills to pay
I ain't mad at ya, it's gonna be a better day[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Riding in a cab but I'm dreaming of a slab
Cooking ounces at a time, pussy nigga do the math
Ten ice chains, Prince like James
The day I made a stack in the trap, my life changed
Y'all ride swangers, we ride Daytons
It don't matter where you from, haters stay hating
Keep the window tinted, artillery when I'm in it
Whip it in the kitchen before Hillary became a Clinton
Assholes by nature, cash flow was major
In the old school, or M codes and fragers
Started with a crumb, but turned it to a brick
They were calling me a bum, my turn, I'm the shit
Razor flipped thing, age of fifteen
Got Chevy in that thing, blades like Chris Creams
Rose on the wrist, when the shows ain't exist
Now my money long enough to put the fours on a six
Boss

[Chorus: Lloyd]
From the depths of the sea to the stars in the sky
I'ma be a hustler till I die
Sixty in the clip in case enough pride
But all them haters want to try
So shorty what you smoking on?
Marijuana's what I'm choking on
I don't care if they call me crazy
But street niggas getting mullah baby

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
I'm still located in the gutter, fresh set of fours
Watching haters foreign, chopper on the floor
Pillowcases full of money, still ain't got no place to go
So I evacuate the safe, hit the hood and let it blow
You thinking I ain't the king of my section, nigga you way off
My hustle make the ghetto amazing like it's the playoffs
In the hood for real, these corners I never stay off
Picture that
I remember of having visions of getting paid
Now I sit in on something suede or in something that's getting sprayed
I'm in that field with the trap around the third eye
This the National Hood Geographics, call it bird watching
I'm this jungle rocking cinematic stones
Interstate, but the bread talking money so long
Pussy niggas mad because I'm getting my money on
Who else you know got out the hood and put half the city on?

[Chorus: Lloyd]
From the depths of the sea to the stars in the sky
I'ma be a hustler till I die
Sixty in the clip in case enough pride
But all them haters want to try
So shorty what you smoking on?
Marijuana's what I'm choking on
I don't care if they call me crazy
But street niggas getting mullah baby

[Bridge: Lloyd]
My name Young Lloyd, yeah you know what I'm on
Many girls are laid in my Styrofoam
And I'm in the H-Town, so don't play around
Or my nigga Trae tha Truth going to lay you down
Rick Ross be the boss in the Phantom and all
Got round the clock rocks, spring, winter, and fall
Some of y'all might call me crazy
But street niggas getting mullah baby

[Verse 3: The Game]
I'm a natural born asshole, is you? Yeah, why?
Because its do or die when them choppers in the air
I see clear as Belvedere, you haters know this my year
Paid no attention to y'all, I'm still thinking about Shakur
Having suicidal thoughts in this Phantom, it's a bitch ain't it?
Paid a half a million for this motherfucker, then paint it
Chinchilla floor mats, that's beyond paper
Me and Trae flying through Houston like Von Wafer
You niggas ain't balling, you T-Mack, you stay hurt
I order more Pequa, got more rocks than a Jay verse
I used to sell pounds, watch 'Mash', and weigh work
Got shot and woke up out a coma, could've been way worse
But now I'm living for my niggas
Locked deep down in the prison hole, with no vision
When I drop the top, I do it for you
So close your eyes and let the sun shine through
Yeah

[Chorus: Lloyd]
From the depths of the sea to the stars in the sky
I'ma be a hustler till I die
Sixty in the clip in case enough pride
But all them haters want to try
So shorty what you smoking on?
Marijuana's what I'm choking on
I don't care if they call me crazy
But street niggas getting mullah babyIt ain't over, it's never gonna be over
And I want you to know you got a angel up there looking down on you
Mamas out of here. Church

[Hook]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea yea
I Believe, I Believe

[Verse 1] (Trae)
I never thought time would be so close, I can feel it within my reach
My life say church is on the move though it’s minus the one who preach
They say success will bring you pain, I say struggle and bring the same
I used to fight to duck the rain, going through hell like I’m in chains
I truly feel this shit in cycle, like Michael, I’m tryna take flight
The sun don’t shine forever, now I’m like fuck it
Go and give a nigga the night light, hope that I’m focused
Can’t lose my faith and go hopeless, been praying hard, hope God noticed
I’m on my way, I feel God owe this
So close, I can’t blow this, told Niko I’d make her proud
I don’t make it, just know I gave it all that I could, one deep facing this crowd
Yeah, I believe just like my grandfather did ‘fore he passed
They tell me God don’t make mistakes, even the time it passed
I just hope I last to see it, my past been a disaster
Got shot once but I’m still here, my smoke clearing up faster
Yeah, I believe something gone give and won’t nothing get took away
11:59, excuse me, let me pray

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2] (Big KRIT)
Yeah, I’m not sure I’m supposed to ease my pain
This would be my first confession since I got some change
No, I ain’t been the same, no, I ain’t the same person
How can I shine when all my people hurting?
How can I ride with all these jackals lurking?
How can I say things will be ok when I can’t be for certain?
My momma tell me she prays me for me I hope her prayers are working
I watch the news, look how we do, I’m thinking lord, have mercy
Yeah, I feel victim to the chase of fame and rubber bands
There’s no excuse for what I’ve done, I know you understand
I’ve been a man in situations I should’ve stayed a child
But when you young and people dying, it makes it hard to smile
I’ve done enough in the eyes of man, but that ain’t enough at all
Before I came to You, I searched, but there was no one to call
Yea I lost friends and I’ve lost family in the midst of all this wrath
I'm scared I'll lose my faith and I’m dying to get it back
‘Cause I believe[Trae]
It's somethin goin on and I don't know if it's my fire from the block
Off the top I know it's somethin wrong
And I don't know who to trust so I gotta keep my Glock
That'll flock tellin everybody move along
Shit everything ain't what it seem
Even the niggas that I love to death shiest cause they playin for they own team
And I be wantin to try and do 'em some harm
Instead of leavin 'em to suffer, I extended my arm
Yeah I'm still runnin with the same ol'gang
No matter where a nigga run it's still the same ol'pain
Same cloud, same night, with the same ol'rain
Same heart still standin like I'm hard as a train and that's game
I thought this shit was too good to be true
Niggas hate the fact that I made it and still come back through
But either way they still know where it's at
Niggas hate it cause they hate me, and I'm showin it back

[Hook - Dallas]
[I can feel it in the air]
I can feel it in the air
[I can feel it in the air]
Oooooh Oooh-I can feel it in the air
Ahhhhh yeah
[I can feel it in the air]

[Trae]
And I don't know what it is but if I'm patient for somethin
Them niggas not they two time me they bound to show what it is
I swear they hate like a ounce of dro
Too strong with a stence so I'm bout to blow
But if they want me then it's fine
I gotta baby brother that's still around that's gon be representin mine (Fuh real)
I know my son gon be okay T Jones, and Boss
And the rest of the click they gon see okay
And I can feel it in the air
Like my niggas feelin plex and I can see it in they stare
But they don't step in the square
So I assume they wanna stick me in my back
That ain't G them niggas need to get it how they pack (they sheist)
Don't even bother cause I'm deaf when it come to y'all
Don't even act like we cool-don't try to speak at all
I should've seen it when my auntie said slow it down
Cause it's a year later with too many fakers around

[Hook - Dallas]
[I can feel it in the air]
You don't have to say a word....I can feel it in the air
No matter what you try to tell me...I can feel it in the air
[I can feel it in the air]

[Trae)]
I guess they mad at me who'da ever thought
My life I'd have 'em lookin bad at me
Nothin but love and that's a damn shame that's why I click
Cause ain't nobody got a nigga back
Matter of fact if I lose I bet they move quick
The same ones who accept my help
Don't give a damn about the pain I felt unless it boost they wealth
But I'm a true solider quiet is kept
You know it's death before even if I get swept
Damn why the hood ain't made of G's
Because if it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to breathe
If it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to leave
Haters worse then a disease that's what I believe
I know my real niggas feel my tone
If you ain't ninety-nine plus you ain't in my zone
Better feel a nigga vibe if I'm flippin alone
Cause I'm aware of my surroundings even if I'm at home

[Hook] - Dallas singing to the endAll this work all these late nights
Still no sleep I can’t lay right
At rap bins and I feel when I’m in it
Street campaign like I’m running for the senate
Time got me feeling I’m the realest around
Running with the stars but I’m still on the ground

Laughing at them hater niggas should’ve been clowns
Getting to hyped imma get to calming them down
Shoulda played ball I’m still on the turf
All I know is there be solid begin different a curse

Say my name in the city
Here to show what I’m worth
Chose to be a king since the day of my birth
Still reppin for the six and when they’re teaching the drill
While they put em in the trap tryna teach em a skill
I’m tryna see em live brother teach em the bill
Yeah my brother doing life tryna get an appeal
Shit

I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t

Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Ain’t shit for free

Asshole king
I was set in my ways
I’ve got me water I was riding my waves
Gang chained up gets your witness as slaves
Who they fucking with imma get to sending them K’s

Few days on the block when I’m pitching my plays
Loyal to my dogs I was running with strays
Price on ya head I can get you a praise
I’m forever in the hood like I’m stuck in a maze

Ain’t above plus on the foreign I can’t crawl it
Different time zone low tone I can’t call it
I don’t really know bout much but getting to it
Haters getting pressed on site I can’t stall it

I’m on this black clout
Picture me coming down
Picture my name is track & field
I’m tryna run them thing
One of the greater leads
I would never throw me down
And if they really shit nigga I don’t fuck around


I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t

Fuck you pay me ain’t shit for free
Ain’t shit for free
This shit ain’t cheap

Four Glocks in the drop
As we ride through the boss way
Getting before the age of 24
Thousand square feet long wait from the hallway

Why should I give a fuck about a nigga
Who ain’t never gave a fuck about me
Answer that
Lavender you know that we ain’t having that
A plus in the kitchen I could bring it back

Jose ain’t even talked to me
No trust in the world they was crossing me
I remember they were Dog or G
Shit changed now hoe
Hey you already know
You can’t ball with me

I don’t owe a nigga nothing
Not a dollar bill or too many discussion
Stop playing
I could dirty like a rush draw now
He be always double couple
H-town

I’m tryna live like J now
I’m on the island oversea like fuck that shit
Somebody say something we ain’t saying nothing back
Cause they niggas dead broke
And we livin like that
From the era of the crack
When niggas rap bout how they sold you
And everybody rap how they on drugs

Rip Freyto Chi Ki nigga

If anybody talk bad about me nigga
They got shit in they mouth cause I be shitting on niggas
But I keep it real I don’t shit on niggas
Four or five hustles like TIP on
Niggas

Sip strong nigga & we blazing
All bad bitches no basic
You ain’t tryna help me coming up
And I couldn’t come to you if I was stuck
So why should I give a fuck

I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t
I can’t I can’t[Verse 1:]
Got a lot on my mind not enough time on my hand
I got to shop some things that i do
But niggers want to fuck up my plans
I put a lot of trust in you
But you don’t know how to carry that
I guess it is my fault
I believe that you will give it back
Shit lonely when you stressing
But fuck it nobody owe me so
Take it i don't think i accept it for
They show me same way
When I’m in need these niggers they dont know me
What the love turn into hate if they cannot grow me
I use to be one of the closest now they
Act like i ain't done shit
This loyalty unhealthy like it’s cancer shit i been sick
Niggers can say these shit just so they can come up quick
These bitches out here play for whatever they can catch a quick lift
The snake travel in packs so I’m traveling back so i chose to be independent
They do so many rocks so that the council had to defend it
They focus on the gram so they don't know they imidrated
So the day i decide to be solid no one they timid

[Chorus:]
Am a fighter got the heart of a lion
With the strength of a million
No  fear I’m like zion
Live like a titan
I go to the war with the mighty
The people will expire
So do whatever you desire
But if i was still young
And now that you play with me like that
Now i see the real you
You don't give a damn so i had to fall back
But nigga i dont want you
Now everybody gotta fight their own damn war
You know that i was true for you
And it's sad to say it ain't like that no more
No more I guess

[Verse 2:]
I guess that's how it goes when they benefitting they reserve you
They playing you to the end when they know they don't deserve you
They not there to say that's a hit nobody get it nobay heard you
But they take your story to the next person only reword it
This pain ain't even mine no more these niggers different so
So this time i ain't going to find no more
I use to benefit you but no time no more
They even madder now they can't shine no more
I guess they fucked up they jealous
The jealousy comes so fluent the plan they had was ruined
Telling me they going to rize but when the person they hate was through it
Even though inside I’m pissed i just let it go because i knew it
Watching from distance like a stadium when i view it

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
It's only for the moment [x2]
It's all up in the moment
You don't even know me[Intro]
Chea
I’m back on my shit, nigga

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
Keep playing with me, I’m in this bitch
And can no one fuck with me, I hear the talk
But you ain’t talking with me, keep popping off
I bet this chopper come see, I don’t give no fucks
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck (I don’t give no fucks)
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck (Yeah)
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Why you all on my dick?
That’s that shit I don’t like
Ho niggas can’t make me believe
I’m trappin', it’s gon' be cold nights
Fuck niggas always got something to say
I’m king, other niggas all in the way
Get your block in your whip, tip all in a day
Boss move, checkmate that was all in the play
A couple niggas don’t like me, oh well
Get a pillow while they bitch go tell
That tough men shit just don’t sell
Streets ride my train I won’t fail
I don’t lip box, I just send shots
Or put a nigga face on the back of a milk box
Fuck that rap shit, I’m a gangster
I don’t get stressed nigga, I get shit poppin'
What the fuck is you looking at, nigga?
Keep tryna play stiff and get found in a box
Just know when I show up on niggas
That Mac-11 got me feelin' like Pac
They say I’m the realest I know it
I bet I show up when I come in this bitch
I go to trippin' it’s over, no point of talkin'
It ain’t nothing to fix

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Never scared to die (No), see the look in my eye (Boss)
Nigga tried to wack me, still drop top in my ride
Fuck this sympathy ho, hit you in your El Camino
Got that eight figure park deal, nigga still quit to sling dope
Get high blowin' that smoke, I die before I go broke
Your baby mama my thot, my eighth year I’m still high
Your house less than my watch, my watch over your life
Ain’t no bitch bad than my bitch and I fucked your bitch twice
Boss sippin' that drank, Boss twistin' that dank
Boss gettin' that bank, just bought Holyfield’s estate
That’s just weed money lil nigga, where your money lil nigga
Leave a hole in your nigga, when we run down on your nigga
Punk (gunshots)

Houston what they do? DJ Khaled
Dade County 305, We The Best Music up in here
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Asshole by nature, tell them bitches remember
I'm a hunnid or better, chain cold as december
Bitch I'm packaging weather, talking snow like the winter
If I don't eat I send gorillas and invite you for dinner
My attitude say fuck who ever, these niggas who with me plexin'
Haters get VIP, so the whole clip at your section
Send a fully automatic pis' at your discretion
Bullets needs guns to bitches fly without no direction
Realest nigga in it, want the title? Nigga take your place
Yeah I'm on that shit that have this niggas try'na break your face
They know I'm a problem in the streets, I never play it safe
Chopper and it's 911, have a ticket off the safe
Better than nothing greater, born first never later
Give 'em half a clip, yellin' out ABN renegator
They do what I tell them, I tell them run up inside a hater
In the hood like a mechanic, flush 'em like a radiator

[Hook: Rico Love]
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on, turn the lights on

I do this for real, I do this for real

Aye walk in here hundred deep, bought the bar 100 flick
Nigga don't want it with me, try'na say none of that
Got a problem with me? When you see me we can handle that
Find out where the cameras at, then we let that hammer splatt (blatt blattt)
Crack dealers, certified trap niggas
We wreck rap niggas, recon now where you at nigga
It's Hustle Gang known to let that muzzle bang
Make you change your music, move these cocaine and other thangs
I don't play with nothin' but a long cane
Run upon a big nigga, lay him out the long way
Don't play with cyber thugs no matter what my phone say
Well, unless you catch a nigga on the wrong day
Called the bitch, you called the bitch
[?] you talking shit
Run upon you with that AR, oh you say you own shit
All of y'all better get duckin' while I'm bustin' at
Fully automatic-tic-tic-tic-tic, watchu lookin' on

If it's drama I got it I got it I got it

If he tripping I got it I got it I got it

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
I hop out, shot fire, Clayco been down
Hundred rounds, stand down
This the G south, we don't play around
I come around they don't say shit
Moment sounds when that K spit
This Rolls Royce got a pink slip
He 15 on that G shit
He 16 on that G shit
17 on that murk shit
My young nigga gonna flip shit
This 4-5 is my sidekick
Clayco's my capital
Big rims, gold teeth
That country boy attitude
Don't make Saddam Hus' after you
Caught 'em caught 'em caught 'em slipping at the red light
Run that chain, run that ice before you lose your life
Car jackings, home invasions, it's a mess
Loyalty over royalty, in the Squad I trust

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Da Truth]
I pull up holding this choppa, bitch
If you at your place, you better get back in it
Cause the way I'm feeling I might drop your bitch
If you wanna be pussy, I'm finna jump up in it
In the Black Phantom, yelling fuck 'em
If a nigga run up on me bet I ain't going duck 'em
Better have a bunch of niggas with a hell of a jaw
If I don't beat 'em the fuck up then bitch I'm busting
Gotta FM loaded up inside this jacket
50 round, twin clips, only way i pack it
If I let them hoes fly you better be acting
Get dough motherfucker, I ain't shooting for practice
I got drug money right up under the mattress
If their heads wanted beef I'm a sell out my package
I'm the king of the streets, in the hood I'm a saint
I'm a send another nigga, fuck a letter them
If you looking for the one, I'm that nigga
You 'bout that life, how the fuck you figured
Yea bitch who strapped up? My shit bigger
This message directed let no Twitter
I've never seen shots like a bitch who domin'
All black on a motherfucker when im rollin'
Shout out to them Navy Seals with the shit I'm moanin'
On to workout, yea bitch I'm tonin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
I said I swear to God I can't wait
Till the day this nigga slip
Headshot 'em off the rip make 'em feel the whole clip
Walking with a slight limp cause them hammers on deck
They gon' kill you for no check they gon' do it for respect
Throwing up the wrong set, better get your ass wet
Headshotting off the motherfucking reel
I got boys, Vice Lords, GD's, and Crips
My Belly and my Ghost came with a pink slip
What you know bout that, Flocka, Waka Flocka I'm your bet
If you raw, gang bang, play ball
For sold crack, my back ain't gotta be against the wall
Just to shoot back this hunn'ed clip
You can feel all of that

They told me chill but this anger in my heart steel
My closes niggas turning on me like I'm cartwheel
I never played with disrespect nigga this score is real
If I was plexing and I still woulda fuck out'cha steal
I'm old school I never post up on this sneak shit
That's all in Houston you can miss me with that weak shit
Keep shooting undercover slugs dissing ass niggas
On the hood you bout to be some missing ass niggas
It don't take much to see these niggas out here fake as hell (fuck em)
All they ways goin have a nigga going straight to jail
I read these bitches like the numbers that's working the scale
And tell em being real ain't rated by the way ya sale
You looking for attention I'm about to make em famous
Soon as this shit get in the fan the pussy niggas blame us
I kept it loyal but these niggas loyal to theyself
I did it out of love they only did it for they wealth

Bailing on 23 inches, and holding for all my felons
Me and lil' bro, been the heat of the West
I got these niggas off the chain, cause I'm the Truth of the West
With a black on black, in back of the back of it with they scope
24 plus strap, cause these niggas know how it go
You see this year I got the music, that'll go get these niggas fired and wired up
Whooping niggas for days, and they ain't chunking they side up
Have these niggas on Anthem, about to start em a riot up
Loading and busting some'ing, that'll be fucking your hide up
My drop be dyed up, the same color as Hoovers
With a houpe a couple cars behind, with gorillas packing rugers
I know these bitches wanna stop us, but I fly right past em
With the left dropped and the right cocked, jamming that S.L.A.B. "The Anthem"
They been waiting so I'ma grant tem, with Z-Ro in a Phantom
This here be Assholes bitch, and we can click on the random

[Jay'Ton]
Who the fuck is Joe Boy Alleycat, bitch where your mama at
You better fall back, 'fore she end up in all black
I'm never caught slipping, wood grain gripping
Still Hoover Cripping, fin to leave your whip flipping
I'm scooting up the block, with my locs and twin gats
Some of my dogs flame, but I promise they bring cash
It's Jay'Ton bitch, and I'm exposing all rats
Running with twelve pounds, hit the wood and I bounce back
Now, show me where your heart at cuz
Cause I'll put into drama, where it start at cuz
Niggas ain't even a threat, so I'm checking em off
And pick that bitch up off the ground and kiss the dust in her mouth cause I'm a asshole

[W.G.]
I'm so gangsta, flipping in my suicide brougham
It's Dub G from A.B.N., packing on chrome
I done waited my time, I'm sitting back on the scenes
Got everybody, wondering what all that red means
Stop hating me bitch, not from Sunnyside but I'll check a ho
With a cocked fo'-fo', in a fo' do'
I ain't tripping, but what I got waiting in the back
Will raise the back of, any nigga that's a Silverback
You wanna know, why we lean so much
Cause grey Screw tapes and red cars, and that purple stuff
And I've been known to send shots your way
We gon rep the Southwest, and hold it down for Grey

[Boss]
Boss in a Regal that's black, I got Blood in the back
Ready to pump the right side of that Lumina, so let it crack cuz
Cuz what it is, what it was
Fuck the fuzz send a slug and put that nigga in the dust cuz
I'm from the H mayn, killers hopping gates mayn
Bossing on niggas, got us where we standing today mayn
When my finger split that thumb, you better run
I got thirteen TTP's, PVL's with guns
Niggas head hunting, we taking souls from niggas set fronting
First time we said we wanted one, y'all niggas ain't said nothing
HGC gon start bucking, fucking with my cousin
I'ma kit-katting and cutting, and if a crisis come I'm dumping

[Hook](Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block

[Verse 1-Trae]
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Twenty inch 4's, they don't make these on the drop
If they wanna jack I ain't finna tell a nigga stop
I bet a hundred stacks he can't take this out the Glock
I'm a damn fool puttin broke niggas outta stock
Take a picture bitch send it to my niggas on lock
I'm a asshole, ghetto hoes love the way I rock
A sick mouth piece-I talk a bitch right up out the cot
I'm 'Tha Truth'if you say a nigga name
And I'll be there to cross ya ass if you say a nigga lame
I use to have a Hoop, but I rearranged the frame
So when they see me tippin slow-they get the fuck up out the lane
All Star in the game, money longer then a train
I finally got fly and I don't think I'm finna change
Thirty stacks out the safe so they see a nigga change
Fifty mo stacks now they know a nigga name
Nah the game ain't the same my attitude thru the roof
I'm bout to take my right hand and run it thru a nigga tooth
I hear boys gettin fly, swagger jackin in the booth
Tell them dickridin niggas that I'm the mothafuckin truth, Real Talk!

(Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block

[Verse 2-Trae]
Ay a nigga wanna find me-I'm the streets of the south
With a bunch of ignorant niggas that'll take it to ya house
In a click of black whips everytime a nigga floss
I tell a bitch to give me head, and tell a bitch to get lost
It ain't nothin to a boss-I'm a league of my own
Better greet me with the code when you hit me on the phone
Tell them hoes I'm on the roam on 26 inches of chrome
I'm at a half of mill and that's off of rappin alone
If you think I'm goin broke my nigga that's where you wrong
If the rappin stops I load up a couple bricks then I'm gone
I use to watch my brother turn powder right into stones
But I done switched the game and put the crack in a form of a song
Now I got the hood set, doors flyin like a jet
Ostrich in the whip got haters on deck
If they thinkin that was somethin tell e'm see me in a sec
Everytime I pull up on e'm I'ma leave they face wrecked(haha)
I'll shut a bitch down, have e'm shook when I'm around
Get e'm if they pride high try to run it to the ground
Ain't shit to get the click and make niggas get out of town
If you ever see this gangsta, then hit e'm up with a sign

(Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block

[Verse 3-Trae]
I'm a gangsta nigga you can tell when I walk
Right off the rip I check a bitch, and you can tell when I talk
I lost count ain't no tellin how many guns I done bought
And when it come to beef I won everytime that I fought
And if I ever end up caught, I get right back to the streets
And if I need to check a bitch I get right back to the beats
And if I need to touch a bitch I'm finna put e'm to sleep
And have his body out of function for a number of weeks
Asshole nigga never will I fold
And I represent the hood everywhere a nigga roll
I don't know what you was told but my boxin game cold
You try it you gon'be the first nigga that's gettin stoled
Then I'm back to the whips, slab floatin like a ship
I just released the top now they sayin I'm a trip
They hate the Mac-11 when I got a full clip
4 deep, 1 deep, 1 blood, 1 crip when I tip
I'm the one and I gotta let they ass know
Thinkin somethin slow and I'ma have to let my last go
I'll get ya touched for alittle bit of cash flow
Let the world know I'ma mothafuckin asshole!

(Chorus-Trae)
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
Gan-gangsta, they don't make these on the blockThis gon be the realest shit I ever wrote, so just know it’s deeper than rap
It was a lot of shit that go, but now I’m bringing it back
I been a G all of my life, and tried to hold it for the best
I’m the realest nigga living, they can write it when I rest
Fu-k it put me with the best, and I can stand out on my own
It’s survival of the truth, and I’ll be coming for the throne
Fu-k being a bigger man, niggas played the game wrong
So I played it how they played it, while remaining in my zone
These niggas hoes, that’s why they keep my name in they mouth
It ain’t hard to find me, bitch nigga I’m the streets of the South
And ain’t no banging over wax, nigga come see me in the hood
In the section where fake is twisted, like the W in wood
I been repping since I was 12, but now I’m 25 strong
With the family of A.B.N., running and toting some’ing chrome
I never trained to be in battle, even though I been at war
Mob made motherf-cker, prolly leave you with a scar I’m the truth
This be the realest, the realest shit I ever wrote
This be the realest, the realest shit I ever spoke
All I know is, (this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote)
All I know is, that I’m gon be the truth
They better know I peep everything in the game, they got me looking at my life different
Niggas out here thinking they can know it, if my vibe different
These other niggas out here falsified, telling lies
Sell a couple records, now they profitized keep it real
You niggas ain’t got the credibility, to be the truth
Unless you out here living what you talking, in the booth
Everyday it be the same, niggas know I’m in the lane
Only fu-king with the killers, cause we feel eachother pain
I hit the highway with my niggas, never toching the caine
Now they got me watching for the FEDs, bitches mention my name
Since I’m the leader of the gang, it make it hard for me to move
I’m the truth, it ain’t gon be a pretty sight for me to lose
Trae bail on street shit, got it on a lock
Everytime I’m going off, niggas done got it on the block
Never something that it’s not, I only know of being Trae
And that’s the truth every motherf-cking day, it ain’t no other way
Niggas saying I got the name to be the truth, and I ain’t even mad at em
But that expression on they face, had me taking jabs at em
This a warning shot, ever seen a nigga at his last
If you haven’t, I advise you let this motherfu-ker pass
I ain’t here to be mistaken, so respect it when I spit it
Fu-k it keep it yourself, cause anyone of you’s will get it
I’m a Asshole, and it’s self explained by the anger
And I’m holding on a Glock, that’s keeping one up in the chamber
I’ma strut it like a gangsta, so my niggas get they bang on
Hopping out the slab, Dickies sagging with my chains on
Hopping fly, cause they seen the dropper with them thangs on
Lord knows, Trae’ll leave them niggas with they brains blown
I’m in another zone, niggas still on cloud nine
And I’m a loner, you niggas don’t need to crowd mine
Trae the Truth is what it is, niggas know it’s time
Plus I’m here to make em lay it down, ‘fore I spray it down
The truth be the realest shit I ever spoke, be the realest shit I ever wrote
(this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote)
Be the realest shit I ever spoke, be the realest shit I ever wrote – 2X
This be the realest shit, I ever spoke
Even if they never see it, this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote
Pay attention, to the shit I quote
Even if they never hear it, this gon be the realest shit I ever spoke – 2X
One hundred percent real, one hundred percent reeeeeal
Heeeey, Trae let em know ooooh
This be the realest shit, that I ever spoke and wrote
This is the truth, heeeey[Trae: Screwed Intro]
Chyeah, know’m talm bout?
You ain’t shit if you ain’t screwed up, for real

Pull a lil’ bitch then I catch ghost
Justa lil’ kid from the ghetto
Never had shit but I got a lil’ bit

Throw a H up, nigga, I ain’t tryna belch or nothin’
Ain't got a whole lotta money but I'm wealthy money
I sip a whole lottta drank but I'm healthy mami
Daddy was cool, but he couldn’t really tell me nothin’

[Verse 5: Bun B]
I’m Port Author, Texas, let’s get that straight off the top
That’s where the hustlin’ and grindin’ and the hatin’ don’t stop
From the west side to east, we out here duckin’ them cops
And coming dine, candy paint, on them mother fuckin’ chops
It’s the land of the trill, that’s where the whole thang came from
And it just a word, or where a rapper get his name from

For years, we represent, with it blood sweat and bullets

Topless, in the slab I come thru)
Elbow and Vogues and expensive clothes
Candy-paint our cars, big booties on our hoes

Put the truck up bitch, I’m swanging four’s)

G'eah, ha ha hey real shit let's go
J-O-D-Y, AKA the Young Gunner, Gunner
AKA the Best Kept Secret though, what it do
Ha ha yeah, A-Town to H-Town real shit
Real life Trae haha, Asshole By Nature nigga
Listen, talk to em from the hood nigga

[Verse 1: Jody Breeze]
I know they hating on us, but the streets is anxious
They waiting on us, we really gangstas
Niggas wanna eat, but they don't know the basics
Keep getting caught, with the fed cases
Fuck rap stay strapped, stacks in the mattresses
Fuck hoes stay strapped, these hoes actresses
I don't see, how some of you niggas have the audasity
To play hard, when you sweet as a dacquorie
I hop's off in the rapping, already mastered it
But I'm no rapper though, my aim is accurate
I'm from a trap, where they turn coke into crack mayn
I'm from a block where they riding through, it's black lanes
We could face off, blow your face off
Two of the realest, Jody Breeze and Trae dog
We too breezy for the gutter, niggas in the struggle
Trying to make a living, try not to kill eachother

[Hook: Dallas] x2
Lord knows, it's hard out here
Niggas is fraud, out here
These streets is scarred, out here
I know, but see I'm good dog

[Verse 2: Trae]
I promise I never would change, these niggas turn shady
Just as quick as they slipping up out your range, and play like it's gravy
Lately they egos fit in with they pride, cause I been on my mission
They know that I'm well on my way and they would of been too, but fuck em they ass is missing
Why they want me right back in the zone, nigga this shit ain't done for play
But this a lesson learned, you get damaged fucking with Trae
Snitches talking like it's a reason, that I'm never understanding
I guess cause some of these niggas out here, never grew up to be a man
But see it's good now, I made my position to help the hood now
Get rid of fuck ass niggas, oh yeah I'm up on how I should now
Homies I use to love hate me, but swear that it's all good now
They envy got me strapped, just in case I misunderstood now
Me and Breeze at ease, hoe niggas don't get too close to us
We provided by the streets, so the ghetto gon' have a toast to us
And this is how it sounds, when them niggas we know be out of line
Homie I'm the truth, and I ain't hard to find

[Hook: Dallas] x2
Lord knows, it's hard out here
Niggas is fraud, out here
These streets is scarred, out here
I know, but see I'm good dog

[Refrain: Dallas]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I'm good
Uh I'm good-good uh, you niggas try to snitch on me
But I'm good uh, you thought you had me down yeah
I'm good uh, yeeeah

[Outro: Trae]
I know (I know)
They fraud (they fraud)
It's ok (it's ok)
Cause bitch I'm good [x4]          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        [Hook: MDMA]
I’m on, I’m on, I’m on, ooh yeah
I’m on, I’m on, I’m on
I’m on (whoa) I’m on (whoa)
I'm on (whoa) I’m on (whoa)
I’m on

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, yeah, glitterati, big bodies and tall swings
Devil on me, Spitalfields and AllSaints
Playing field ain't levelling the lane
Throwing stones at your bones, kick pebbles at your pain
Swear they go hard, but they sold Jello in the paint
Trying to Carmelo but he can't
Lord have mercy
But we be having that jersey
Flowing so hungry, rapping that thirsty
Think fast, fast women, like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Fast life like born on Wednesday
And died on Thursday
Fast money like Zakat al-Fitr, break fast
Slow my roll like brake pads
Cause if you run the light, they just might stop you niggas
Rodney King on the dome, just things that I’m on

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Uhh, I’m on this one way, headed where the slums play
If I don’t make it then somebody tell my son spray
Struggling first class, headed for the runway
Real nigga shit, I gotta make it one day
Sick of hard times so I tell em to fall back
Sitting in all white but the Phantom is all black
For everything I lost, tell em I want it all back
Everyone who left me for nothing, tell em to call back
They ain't authentic, tell them I don’t even relate
Minus the love, they feel like I was something to hate
Tell them hate now, the world looking at 'em
They on the front row, everybody looking at 'em
I used to have dark nights now it’s bright lights
Daytime bus pass now it’s night flights
Had a poor man swag now it’s priced right
Always wanted a piece of the pie now it’s sliced right
Yeah, you can tell em I’m home
The streets in need of a king, you can tell 'em I’m home
Used to be at the bottom, tell ‘em it wasn’t for long
Now I’m always in the hood like I never was gone
I’m on, I told 'em I’m something they ain't gon' cut off
Try to hit the switch if you want I ain't gon' cut off
A 100 thousand volts, a true thing gon' shut off
Anything in the way is gon' get permanently shut off

[Hook: MDMA]
I’m on (whoa) I’m on (whoa)
I'm on (whoa) I’m on (whoa, ooh yeah)
I’m on

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Never letting go, although sometimes I slip
Like banana peels for heels, my spill is so legit
Notice it every time I pick up the microphone and spit
Eyes wide, ears open like you on a doctor's visit
But this ain't physics or rocket science
This a little tune to keep you motivated and inspired
I am not a motivational speaker
But people get easily motivated when they hear B-I-G reeking
Havoc on the track boi, grab it hold it tight
My city, growl with me, hootie hoo'ing through the night sky
Butterfly bow tie, made my mark like the craters on the moon
Rocking alligator shoes, I'm on

[Verse 4: Wale]
You know me, cool breeze, a nigga high
Rather live alone forever than live a lie
I’m in the zone, foam pros keeping me comfy
Got squares, dark squares cover my luggage
I'm in love with some women, more in love with my mother
I’m in love with my God, less in love with this money
And my level is off, got a bigger cigar
Out in Vegas with broads, bout as thick as Toccara
My ambition is ammunition if this is war
They can’t run, they can’t run, this is a wall
Got forever endurance, forever under purists
I put my breath in this motherfucker, they better hear it
Good denim, bad women and better lyrics
My only dream to get rich and never marry
Give these niggas the pink slip when they appear
And I ain't tripping, my only competition’s the mirror

[Verse 5: Wiz Khalifa]
Remember they used to be like, "Who is this?"
Now I’m up in this bitch, smoking weed out in London
They bringing me fish and chips, thought of this as a youngun
Who know this be the life that I really live?
Now I’m flying on trips, promoters and owners giving me gifts
Don’t gotta shop, I ain't paying for shit
This Audemar on my wrist, got it harder than missed
Older people looking at me how I bought all of this
I say I got it from grinding, perfect timing
Started at the bottom, ain't afraid to climb it
Took something rough and turn it to a diamond, oh
It ain't come easy, had to find it
And now you can’t say I got game cause I define it, uh
Nigga I’m on like the light on
And if I ever fall off, I'll be back on the same night
Me and my dogs, we on the same flight
Carefree I don’t need to stress
Smoking Khaled, my weed the best

[Outro: MDMA, Wale, Wiz Khalifa & Big Boi]
Ooh yeah, I’m on, I’m on, I’m on
Wale, double M-G shit
Tahahahah, yeah, smoking while I'm rapping, biatch! Yeah
I’m on (whoa) I’m on (whoa, ooh yeah)
Ya got Lupe Fiasco, Trae tha Truth, and Big Boi, Daddy Fat Saxxx
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on[Intro: Mark Morrison]
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
Today is the day I get out on my feet
Remove them chains, they shackled on me
Press my luck, stop fucking with them hoes that cluck
Cause the same motherfuckers the ones that got me stuck
Tryna use me up ’til my tank on E
Then leave me stranded, scrambling in these streets
For a dollar a day until my pockets is straight
Soon as you move out the hood them niggas hollering you fake
Make ‘em swallow the bass from the Kicker
I’d rather be a dead man than a nigga
I’d rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
I gotta make moves, I can’t hang with ya
That used to be the fly shit back in ’95
But now I want a crib and a car I can drive
And ain’t nobody out there help me cause I’m grown
Gotta leave them childish games alone
Nigga I’m on

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I’m in the hood still praying for a piece of faith
I know he on his way I’m hoping he don’t make it late
I’m up the bat, I just hope I make it to the plate
I’m Babe Truth, you can tell ‘em I’m one of the greats
Used to shoot for the stars now my aim live
I’m the truth nigga something that your name not
A thousand watts ain't a thing that I can’t shine
It ain't a wrist or a chain that I can't rock
Tell ‘em I’m on something like city lights
I used to be out they sights, tinted like city nights
Now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
You can tell ‘em I put on for my city in plenty fights
Tell ‘em I ain't gon lose they heated like I’mma tan 'em
I’m bout to throw ‘em in this drop with no ceilings so I can fan ‘em
Pull up on the bike same color the Phantom
And jump out on them haters just to tell ‘em I couldn’t stand ‘em

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I’m on top of my game yo
The OG Grand daddy kush, cocaine flow
I’m about that cash not that tango
Head shots, dump a whole clip in ya Kangol
Claim to be a real nigga we know you ain't though
I be in the hood, all the places you can’t go
Visuals, you can see the pictures I paint yo
Residuals, I just put it all in the bank yo, it’s pitiful
Hoes only after your bankroll
Stay off of the phone, watch out for the plain clothes
Yeah I rep my set, I ain't in the gang though
I protect my neck I carry the thing yo
I’m on the same shit that the boss is on
Do it for those in the Feds, up North or gone
I’m on a winning streak, I done got my losses on
It’s ironic cause even when I’m off I’m on
Yeah I’m on, uhh, what?

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support, made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the ports the city of no remorse
Where they shooting back and forth like they playing horse
May the force be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed and I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve, damn I grieve with you
This a preview, I see you in the summer, my new shit dumber
I’m on

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Life at the bottom is devastating
You’re hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
By suckers that wanna be you and never live with the Matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated, anonymous then you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomited everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
Just wish them happy belated, fuck you I made it, I’m on

[Verse 6: B.o.B]
Tokyo, Amsterdam, Denver to LA
Minutes turn to hours and hours to pay
The days turn to nights but the nights never change
It’s funny time is money used to be a turn of phrase
But now it’s company policy
I’m no spokesperson, no tricks, no gimmicks, no coercion
And they say, "Bob, man it’s good to have you back"
But I say, "I've been here, where the fuck have y'all been at?"

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Thinking how Pac lived at 22
That's ’93, I was four now I'm 22 on tour
One, two shots of my life, barely hold on
But I’m drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
With mic’s on, lights on and they gon’ applaud
Young nigga, Versace they never seen before
And they gon' watch me, copy shit that I got on
I’m too fly, I ain't got a flaw
Tell the law we above the law, God bless, amen every lost soul
And the group so good, went solo
Globe trotting, now I’m blowing up like an afro
Nigga thought you knew what I do
Rolling through ya area, double R coupe
Penthouse level now we only party on the roof
Bitch I’m a rebel so I move how I wanna move
Last King, YMCMB

[Verse 8: Gudda Gudda]
Used to run around the hood picking honies up
Now I’m doing shows around the world picking money up
Used to be slept on like a pillow
Went from trapping in a rental to rapping on instrumentals
Now its money on my mental and women get sentimental, huh
It’s cause the flow is sweet as a pack of skittles, nah
Yellow gold, yellow diamonds in the middle, nah
Stand up nigga, I was never known to sit down

[Verse 9: Bun B]
Well as the world spins around and around on its axis
Boys flip from town to town with the package
Stuffing bills and pounds and browns in a mattress
Sending clowns underground for practice
The fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown
But never in the battle when the drama goes down
Easy to be the boss from behind the wall
But we gon see who really goes down when it’s time to brawl
Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying
You gotta show love to where you from all day
And when the going gets rough, don't get to going, get to staying
Put it down for your people and no delaying, know what I’m saying?

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on[Intro: Trae tha Truth & D.R.A.M.]
Shit (oh-whoa, whoa)
They say three times the charm, huh? (No-whoa)
Hehe, I got ya

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Yeah, all gas, fast livin' like somethin' was speedin'
Ashy to classy now I bless 'em like someone who sneezin'
I'm only here to give 'em pressure, bitch, picture me squeezin'
Against the world like I was Pac, wasn't nobody believin'
Nothin' deceivin', know the truth, what the fuck you was needin'?
We gather this evenin' for the one, reputation was steamin'
Vision me gleamin' from the mud, ain't no point in you cleanin'
I'm motivation for the ones who nobody was feedin'
Automatic still give 'em the same kick
Started the sideline now I'm starrin' in Game 6
Spit and make 'em replay it like they're stuck on the same disc
Work, I give 'em new, never stretchin' the same brick
Never the same chick, yeah I'm still on that same shit
Cop me a new spot, tryna see where the plane fits
Picture me with a crown, next to that where my name sits
Galaxy in the ceilin' just to show 'em what fame gets

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hm, in the heart of the jungle walkin' through the fire
You beat the charge if you showed up with an alibi
Runnin' wild in the city, no direction
All we know is get that dough, run up the checks and
Huh, I'm self-made, wasn't made for the military
Get paid, dodge jail and the cemetery
You better reach for the stars, take your best shot
You let them haters kill your dream, your ass be assed out, fo'real

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Uhh, fill a Backwood with three nicks
V6 cut the coke, remix
Squeeze clips if ever we hear that he snitched
I'm allergic to broke niggas in the precinct
Found out my man was hatin' and we ain't speak since
Barney's, Nord's can't add up the paper we spent
Tryna get drunk, I'm tokin', I got a P bent
I touched a million, ain't sleep since, on defense

[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley]
Freedom got me feelin' like I flown up
Out of prison, I ain't think that I was blowin' up
Bunch of young rich niggas holdin' Rollies up
Run up on us, watch how quick I'll lift the toaster up
Money got me feelin' like you can't control us
Servin', watchin' out for the patrollers
We used to play the game, bring your controllers
Seen niggas get killed, heart froze up
Picked up them choppas, got to go and duck
Shootin' everything up, it ain't no ho in us
Shit ain't even last, free bro and them
In Chicago I'm home, that's on foe and them
Now I'm thinkin' right 'cause I see I can make it
Saw the fam strugglin' and I couldn't take it
You got it out the mud, I got it out the pavement
I used to miss payments, got the title, dare you try to take it
Hah!

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
Triple OG
Never without vision or livin' goal-free
Never writ it though, I've been out gettin' this since '03
Every little red cent and every dividend
Has been counted and acquired
Been legit, legal and been with the code
I'm colder than December in the winter cold
Look, I've been out givin' canned goods and clothes
To the children on 34th, real nigga, ugh

[Verse 6: Curren$y]
I could put you on like socks
Put you on like my watch
Put you on the block, you can get that off
Put you on the right lot, you can get that car
Put you on like a fitted, put you on in my city
Got the stars in the ceilin'
That's the Wraith, got the top in the trunk, that's a don
I could give it to a nigga either way 'cause I'm on, L

[Chorus: D.R.A.M., Gary Clark, Jr., & Mark Morrison]
I'm on (whoa) I'm on
I'm on (whoa) I'm on
I'm on (whoa) I'm on
I'm on (whoa) yeah

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
Wakin' up, feelin' good, rollin' through the neighborhood
Do or die, every day, I lead 'em in a different way
I don't take no mess, get it off of my chest
I'ma be dressed to impress, no stress, fresh
Off the Eastside, Trae called me up and said
"Unc', I'ma need you on the B-side"
So I came through-a, mic checked, one-two-a
Gettin' real funky, kinda smell like manure
Eight cars, eight stars
Return of the mack with these hot eight bars
Flip through it, dip through it
This is the shit that'll make you get to it
Break down, give it up, pour it up
Now drink it up, roll it up
Light it up, how you feel, y'all?
See you in high definition with a mothafuckin' real Dogg

[Verse 8: Fabolous]
And every day I'm on
And if I wasn't, then why would I say I'm on?
Get an M and get low, that's the Dre I'm on
Get a B in blue, that's the Jay I'm on
They on sidelines watchin' what play I'm on
I call a audible, that's what a baller do
They keep askin' me, "Is there more to do?"
Well, ain't water wet? Well then it's more to get
Til' my shorty's set, and his shorty's set
This game ain't over, it's more quarters left
I gotta rep my city, do it for the set
I gotta talk my shit until I'm short of breath
Cause the world is full of niggas tryna off your on switch
Tryna find a place that your coffin gon' fit
Me and my niggas on some confidant shit
And we ain't really feelin' that off and on shit, I'm on

[Verse 9: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
Chasin' paper, starin' out the casket
Was a stunna 'til they froze all the assets
Killers at your neck 'til you cut a check
You talkin' 'bout the money, nigga where it's at?
Cars for my dogs, do it for the cause
Right back here tomorrow nigga, inshallah
Prayin' on my knees, do it for the keep
Do it for the team or I'ma let it be

[Verse 10: Chamillionaire]
Hahah, Chamilitary mane
They thought I was done, but really I ain't even stress it
Just look at all the dough I got invested
Two years and two billion dollar exits
And now your relevance ain't lookin' that impressive (it ain't)
So glad we ain't gotta chase relevance
And I would like to thank the dead presidents
For not livin' forever-ever, forever-ever
For all of them that passed, I've been gettin' paid ever since
We okay, still paid, still stackin' it
We gon' stay, courtside, that's accurate
We gon' take the White House and get back in it
They tried to turn us into the villains like Colin Kaepernick
But it's okay, Gotham City needs savin'
They'll fight back but I'ma shock 'em like Raiden
I don't fold, I don't quit and don't cave in
Your worst nightmare, Freddy Krueger, Wes Craven

[Chorus: D.R.A.M., Gary Clark, Jr., & Mark Morrison]
I'm on, I'm on (whoa)
I'm on, I'm on (whoa)
I'm on, I'm on (whoa)
I'm on, yeah

[Verse 11: G-Eazy]
G, uhh, and I don't think he really needs any coachin'
The weather's gettin' hot, Eazy Season approachin'
Came up and everybody sees the devotion
I put the work in, I cause a commotion
Whenever I'm in public, modern-day Elvis
Hoes at my shows wanting selfies
Made it here and ain't nobody helped us
Now I'm on a path to be great so they say
That's what everybody tells us, ya know

[Verse 12: Styles P]
Raised knee-deep in the dope game
If I had two guns up then they was both aimed
Saturday mornin', I'm watchin' Soul Train
Eatin' leftover food, lo-mein
Now I'm plant-based, couple juice bars
I'm on now, I don't care if the stamp straight
Told Trae I'm the truth like his name is
Can show you what pain is, I'll tell you what game is
Ghost

[Chorus: D.R.A.M., Gary Clark, Jr., & Mark Morrison]
I'm on (whoa) I'm on
I'm on (whoa) I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on (ohh) I'm on
I'm on, I'm on (whoa)
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on

[Verse 13: E-40]
Ayy Trae, let The Counselor speak
E-40! The best that ever did it and got away with it
Let The Counselor speak
Not a septic tank, but I'm with the shit
On my Coast, I'm the topic and the subject
Where I'm from, it's hella squeeze and heathens' guns bust
I wish that TD Jakes would come and pray for us
They pimpin', they flockin', they like to steal and rob
Backdoor their loved ones, inside job
That's why I stay with a stapler, a baby tomahawk
Life or death situations in case I gotta pop
I made a promise to the Lord that I'ma keep it funky
Never switched, never sell my soul for money
I always been for right, maybe that's what's wrong
Now I'm on like the most requested song
Since a teen, I was doin' my thing, magazine
On the 1300 block, we had a machine
I had a quarter mil' at the age of 19
In the kitchen cookin' birdies with no wings
The best rappers come from the gravel, the slums
Empty rack with spaghetti sauce jars rockin' up crumbs
It ain't easy bein' on for 30 years
To see the glitter and glamour but not the blood, sweat and tears
I'm an old ass youngsta, bruh, I'm a vet
Sick Wid It Records, sellin' cassettes before the internet
I never made a mixtape in my life
But one day I'ma do it for my fans, the people that saved my life
I'm on

[Chorus: D.R.A.M., Gary Clark, Jr., & Mark Morrison]
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, yeah, ohh
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, ooh yeah[Hook: Future]
Tippin’ on fours (tippin’ on fours)
Pourin’ up fours (pourin’ up fours)
We ridin’ swingers (we ridin’ swingers)
Katrillion-dollar swagger (katrillion-dollar swagger)
Yeah, I’m screwed up (screwed up)
I’m screwed up (screwed up)
I’m screwed up (screwed up)
I’m screwed up (screwed up)
I’m screwed up (screwed up)
My ‘hood is in love with me – the ‘hood love me

[Verse 1: Trae The Truth]
I stay screwed up, don’t shit else count
I pull up in somethin’ you niggas can’t pronounce
All these orangutans hittin’ at somethin’ that bang
It ain’t no game, you can hear it on the side of your house
Home of the pimp, home of the fifth, pimp
Screwed-Up Clique, this’ll be the get respect back
Robert Davis shit, disrespect that
This a fact: I’ll put you in a box like Jack
Screwed-up Texas, home of two-cups
Everything purple, most are slowed up
Niggas thought it was over, now they trippin’, I showed up
Tell that bitch I’m the one, get lost or load up
Everything I rock got diamonds on it
If it ain’t 10-point you ain’t gon’ find it on it
Hoes laughed back then, now they on my dick
Shit, you ought to see the way they climbin’ on it
I’ll throw up the Ace, let her know I’m the truth
H, A-Dub and Moe, Clip D I salute
Frontline, I got this bitch, I’m a truth
I don’t fuck around with haters, I’ll fuck around and shoot
Yeah, money, great tapes, get screwed up
Hate a mechanic, I’ll never put a tool up
If I hit him with this, you ain’t gon’ get that fool up
On the way to the ‘hood, tell the homies to tool up

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Trae The Truth]
Swimming pools of purple, keep that shit out back
Heard of my city? I guarantee we ‘bout that
Tougher, the drop lost, I still ain’t found that
Fuck my truck, I’m tryna beat him up out that
Swing this bitch, what the fuck I should do?
I don’t even drink, but the rest of my ‘hood do
Brand new whip, ‘bout to get him a new shoe
Do it for the city, only thing I would do
Hatin’ on me, yeah bitch, I would to
You ain’t shit if you ain’t screwed up
Everything is slow in this Texas
Everything about me screwed up
Keep racks in a bag, racks in a safe
Hublot watch, stones all on the face
They say I’m mixed up, yeah, I’m all on base
Where them haters at? I got chrome on the waist
Tell them I’m still the king, now what it look like?
Never be in the kitchen with somethin’ if it don’t cook right
How the fuck you think you me? Bitch, you don’t look right
I’m heavy up in the game, it ain’t shit light
So if you got me wrong, you gon’ get right
And if your bitch on me, she gon’ get pipe
You ain’t seen nothin’ like this, better sit tight
While I flex this shit, you gon’ get lights

[Hook: Future]Hope you're listening while I'm still
Around


It's hard to deal wit people when they said
It was love
But wasn't nothing shown
I know ain't nothing promised & so I
Talked to God before my life is gone
I guess I'm gettin old
Because I tell myself I gotta write my
Wrongs
I don't believe in lies
I had to see the truth when all the hype
Was gone
Tryna find a way to smile
I got a child on the way
If i can get my problems
Let 'em pile for today
Knowing inside that I deserve
Everything
That I got forreal It's kind of hard
Being Trae
Still I pray I got to do my
Best

[Trae]
Waking up early in the evening, ready to start up my day
Hop out the bed and hit the shower, eyes dozing away
Thirty minutes flew away, and now I'm back on my track
My mouth fresh diamonds shining, I don't know how to act
But what do you know, some broad was still laying in my bed
I ain't gon lie and I say I fucked, but I recall receiving head
But that's another note, get your ass up I gotta burn out
And if you make me late, you ain't gon like the way this turn out
Ten minutes later, get the keys and I'm out the do'
Hop in a black on black, I'm thinking fast but I'm crawling slow
Private calls hit my cell, but all they gon get is the dial tone
Since Ruben ex bitch, wanna keep playing on my phone
Have ninety-nine problems, but the hate ain't one
Fuck it the cash ain't either, so I'm strapped with a gun
I hit the West on the tip, while I'm flipping a '59
Eyes covered by the locs, cause these diamonds be known to blind
I rep the West like the captain, with the general who in charge
Ain't nobody got no problems, since they know my entourage
In the blue or either red, well acquainted with the D's
From the North to the South, tops crawling more than these
See I'm the youth of the West, my nigga pimping ain't a thang
Plus my swagger kinda gangsta, so the city know my name
More than life in the hood, got me looking like a star
Plus they go to bat for Trae, like I was dying in a war
Conversating with Pimpin' Ken, or maybe Good Game
Telling me to pimp a bitch, and I can get some good change
Half the world wanna see, what's finna be my next move
But my next move will show you, how I make the rest groove
Just another type of note, that a playa can show ya
If you relate us to the good, and if not I don't know ya
I show the South, everytime a nigga peep my style
I'm classified as a mack, check my playa file

(*talking*)
Huh, know pimping ain't a thang over here homie
Yeah we straight, but you know we playa at the same time
This next verse here, is for them hating ass niggas
Who can't get they shit straight, and they bitch choose a G
Then they wanna get mad, wanna beat the bitch up I'ma give you niggas some game

[Trae]
On the cool I fuck a lot of hoes daily, these niggas turn shady
If they find out that they hoes, wanna pay me
Never ever will they play me cause I'm G made, I don't need a broad
I'd rather sit and cap with niggas, part time on the 'vard
Only woman that I love, is my mama
On a bitch that I'm gripping, will a nigga feel the drama peep the game hater
I'ma tell you, like a nigga told me
Get the cash and keep it playa, niggas fly in these streets
I never ever saw the rings, but I swear these niggas cuffing
Talking tough from a distance, but they heart done got em bluffing
Should I click, guess I need to continue my mission
Plus you hoes ain't on my level, I'm pimping while you be wishing
I got the cars and the house, wardrobe so Asshole
Plus I'm on my game, well acquainted with the cash flow
And if I quit, it's gon be hell to see my son
Cause it's all inside my genes, baby Neek finna come

(*talking*)
And that's real talk, right there homie
Real playas do real playa thangs, know I'm saying
Nigga don't get mad, you wanna go give your bitch a black eye
And a busted lip, and she chose a G
Or wanna ride on side a G, and look good for a second
Get your game face on nigga, nigga be tripping me out with this bullshit
How the fuck you gon have a bitch, and wanna box that hoe like a nigga
But when you catch the nigga in the street, you tal'n bout uh
It was a misunderstanding who do this and that, come on mayn
Get your shit together, for real see me in these streets nigga
Asshole By nature ha-ha, you niggas be tripping me out mayn
That's what that is, you niggas is marks mayn
Ol' pile of pimping ass niggas mayn, matter fact give me the powder
I'm finna slap the shit, out one of these hoe ass niggas[Verse 1: Trae]
Tha Truth back, let's get to business
It's something unfamiliar
Call it a foreign image

Riding with something freaky

Certified gangster, please don't ever doubt me

Chopper in the Chevy, top rollin' back

It's raining scattered bullets
Too late to run for cover, I drain em like Kobe
Then I evacuate to the gutter
On something that's pokey with looks
And a trunk they'd like to stutter
I rank as the king of the city
It ain't gon be another

I'm the city of Houston, you can tell I miss Texas
The king of the streets, somewhere deep with gorillas
Behind something that's tinted, bitch you see the gorillas
These other niggas ?
And when I seem 'em let's fuck 'em minus the penetration

I'm gettin' situation, I know you bitches hate it
I'm in the new Aston, the one Swiss created
Can't give you a dime, but I can get you faded
Before you become a member, you get initiated
A lot of racks, big ice heavy weapon
The hood still love me cuz I never left 'em
I distributed, yeah, I get rid of it
It's all coming back, every bit of it
I'm territorial, it's your memorial
And don't feel bad, I'm talkin' to all of you
This is real shit, and that's nonsense
I got AK's, I got Thompson's
I got investors, I get sponsors
They scared of the crew, I'm wit monsters
And ain't nothin' for sure but we touchin' the raw
And they gotta let us in or we rushin' the doorYeeeeah

[Hook: Russell Lee - 2x]
In the ghetto, I'm living in a ghetto world
In the ghetto (in the ghetto), it's a struggle but I gotta maintain

[Trae]
Welcome to the ghetto, where forever be the same
Hard times, got my people unable to maintain
Everytime I look around, it's somebody doing bad
That'll put you in the grave, for som'ing they never had
Everyday in the hood, it be the same thang
Poverty running my people, so they love pain
And I don't know if it's wrong, but still I know it ain't right
I seen a lot of people die, in the street life
The other day it hit my heart, when I watch the news
A lil' girl got killed, while she was 'sleep in her room
And she ain't deserve to die, cause that's a kid dog
Them niggas took the life, that she ain't get to live at all
Sometimes I wanna help the ghetto, but it ain't gon do a thang
Cause I know that they ignant, and that's a god damn shame
It's an everyday task, trying to live a good life
Inside of the ghetto, where everybody be shife

[Hook - 2x]

[Yung Redd]
Welcome to the South, niggas ain't sleep at all
Ery'body out on the block, stay ducking them laws
A couple niggas on parole, hustling by the sto'
I'm telling that ain't the way to go, play your role
But you don't hear me though, this what I'm living fo'
Hustle till I get mine, grind cause I need mo'
Shots release, too late for you to scream peace
This how it is in the street, leaving is obsolete
And still I maintain, seeing the same thang
Sometime I scream, my brain just looking for a change
But day in and day out, I move in and move out
Keep my bidness discrete, I'm on a paper route
I wasn't broke for nothing, still I was learning some'ing
If you ain't been through nothing, then you ain't seen nothing
This how it really is, around my way
Where anybody can get it, anytime of the day

[Lil Boss]
I analyze the block, babies are running round with Glocks
Dope in they socks, can't skip hot so fuck the cops
Moving from crumbs to bricks, nigga these slums are thick
I try to tell my lil' niggas, but they think they slick
These white folks don't play, they gon hot your way
They try to give you twenty years, just for living the wrong way
And who's to say now-a-day, right from wrong
They ain't living how we live, so they can't get in my zone
We get chased home for stones, and laws wanna break our bones
In places in and out a high cell, to roam
And that's prolly the reason, we going crazy
Pissed at poverty, cause the system trying to fade me
Lately, I've been trying to stay out of trouble
But it's hard to stop from copping, the sack and flipping the double
Don't catch the wrong route, when you on that Metro
There's a sign in front of the hood, that says Welcome To the Ghetto

[Hook - 2x]

[Spice 1]
I wonder, if heaven got a ghetto
But b-burning down the b-block, I put the petal to the medal
Running with my cousins in Texas, Lil' Cross and Big Money
My nigga Trae and Lil' Joe, nigga all action
In the ghetto, I've been riding through the hood for years
And ain't a damn thang changed, mama still shedding tears
Niggas fresh out the Penn, some niggas just going in
Some niggas gon run and stutter, turning they self in
Never seen a black man, flying dope on a plane
But they lock us up for it, shackle us with chains
Welcome to the ghetto, ghetto starts and mob cars
With bullet holes in it, niggas shot up and scarred
But still living, driven by the game itself
To stay alive in these cold streets, mashing for wealth
Up in this ghetto, O.G.'s P's and C's
Thugs, pimps, playas hit the 6-4's or 3's

Now see, the definition of a real nigga
Is about it, in this motherfucking song right here
You know, it took two real niggas to collab
And make some motherfucking shit happen man
It's your boy Yung Joc, you know Block Entertainment
And my motherfucking nigga Trae, Asshole By Nature
Ay Trae, tell me what you is nigga

[Trae]
I'm a gangsta to the end, riding for the set
Black Chevrolet, with the paint still wet
J's on my toes, locs on my eyes
Crawling on 4's, everytime I slide by
Nothing less than the truth, on the streets of the South
Hoes on my swag, cause the diamonds in my mouth
But I move low key, posted in the trap
Raw with the rap, to put my hood on the map
I'ma do this one for H.A.W.K., and his brother named Pat
And my partna named Screw, so I let the trunk crack
What they know about that, haters better chill
Plus I'm packing somnething, that they classify steel
Repping my block, still doing my thang
Trunk full of bang, holding A.B.N. gang
Screwed Up Click, I'ma let the world know
Before it's all over, we gon make the world slow

[Hook]
You can find me in the hood, swanging in a drop
Trunk popped up, now I'm letting back the top
Locs on my face, and my grill so clean
Thirty grand talk, boppers hopping on my team
Moving so slow, banging my Screw
Moving so slow, banging my Screw
Moving so slow, banging my Screw
Hop out on the block, still hollin' what it do

[Yung Joc]
'65 Impala, Cheve SS
The top disappear, see the clear VVS
I guess you know the name, I ain't even gotta say it
When I say it's going down, SK start spraying
Block E-N-T, and A.B.N. niggas in charge
Ery'body mugging, nigga face different starch
I'ma let you pull your card, but watch how quick I pull it
Ay fuck a semi-auto, my niggas pack fullest
We bullies on the block, the hustle don't stop
It's eat what you kill, that's the motto off top
Yeah it's the A-Town, and the H-Town
Tell em this the shake down, lay face down
Me and my nigga Trae, getting cake now
Split it down the middle, 50-50 that's the break down
Baby keep your face down, and don't talk back
You can find me in the hood, nigga distributing packs

[Big Pokey]
My guns go off, when my fists is hard
Mobbed up cuz, nigga pistols'll scar
You got your knife on you homie, that's for twisting cigars
I got my knife on me homie, that's for twisting your guards
These niggas, wanna play you for weak
It's going down, motherfuckers drizzown when they playing it deep
I do the damn thang, niggas talking about it
I'm a problem run into it, you ain't walking up out it
Sensei'll fade the pack, I get mean
Lean on you with this beam, till you fade to black
Cuffing broads, cause I mack on chicks
I go hard same nigga hit your hard, put your Lac on bricks
Niggas a trip, crock bull give niggas the clip
Slap niggas in they trap, when they giving me lip
S.U.C. my nigga, we missing H.A.W.K
I'm gon live through the rest of the click, that's real talk

[Hook]

[Trae]
Hop out on the block, like I'm still hitting stangs
Platinum in the hood, so they tend to know my name
Yellow VS-1's, got me switching up the game
Might hop fly, top dropping like the rain
Hoes talk down, Trae never get mad
Niggas old school, still jacking my swag'
Y'all concerned about a playa, since the day of my birth
Grab a couple mill, and I can show you what I'm worth
Sitting so low, everytime I come down
Trunk just popped, so I'm showing my surround
84's got me tipping, so low to the ground
Still hitting licks, moving off the Greyhound
Watching for the laws, I ain't fucking with the time
Bitch I'm in my prime, ain't no stopping my shine
I advise, that they lead the truth to the throne
If you say I ain't the realest, say bitch you dead wrong

        Here is what all happened at the southside house
Meet DJ screen the man who has created a new sound
When I first started I thought it would all be alright but
My people started to listen to it and feel it, it really jumped off
And I know it's going to be lit

New clips on rap music that is taking him from the underground
To the mainstream, he’s slowing down rap music, making him
Other rap clips and he’s dancing as they go around

Fighters and DJ scroll found into a national phenomimom because
Right now it’s his own style and it’s new to we down on the west coast
The east coast and the midwest and finally hearing about it

He’s already signed to a record label and his second CD sold over
One hundred thousand copies, His current CD debut at number 57 on the chart
Even though he had no business
Trae Tha record continued where he sold his
Rap creation
So we seeing a blessing that somebody really likes our music
Cause now it’s ready to get realer play it and quit saying something that I did[Verse:]

Hey my nigga trae truth
It's time to give the people the truth
Nobody’s speaking for the streets right now
I mean for the streets street
The struggle not so much because you in the streets
Killing and shooting and selling dope not that shit
We talking  about the struggle
Ain't no music out here for the struggle right now
That's what the people need
That's what i want you to get on this album nigga

We need some shit to speak for the people
Cause when i look on instagram I’m like
Everybody rich the fuck going on
But when i look outside it's like everybody is struggling
Struggling let's get back to that
Let's get back to some music that we
We can speak on what we see

Hey now I run this city and I'm a keep runnin'
I'mma keep runnin' but I'm never runnin' out of money, uh-uh

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
King of the city tell them haters I run it
13 years in this bitch I'm crowned it they many who done it
I'm saluting the south, the hood nigga say I'm one hundred
My facility is the streets only rapper that funded
A couple haters nothing major they don't get attention
They probably mad I stay on fire like the devil's kitchen
And while they playin' I just cop the chain of three dimension
Like a bitch eatin' pussy niggas in the fuck position
In this city I'm authentic my section is valid
We the best and niggas know it, I yell it like Khaled
Ain't no debatin', if I speak motherfuckers respect it
You say be in and you go motherfucking chicken

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm the heart of this bitch so why the fuck would you test it?
Tell 'em I got this bitch on lock like something got arrested
If you mention Houston [?]
Paparazzi flashin', I tint the whip and I [?]
Black on black on this black foes, black designers and black clothes
Hop in up out this black Rolls, suicide on this back doors
I'm in this gutter way bellow, it ain't too many lower
And a foreign bitch without her clothes tryna get some exposure
I'm the general in my city, frontline I'm a soldier
You play with me and I could make you where nobody know you
Tell 'em that money talking and I don't plannin' on shuttin' up
I'm try'na make this motherfucker bounce until I fuck it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
They know I'm pissed off why the fuck would they play?
Their opinion don't mean a thing when they come to fuckin' with Trae
I show them this middle finger, them fuck niggas is gay
Niggas yellin their time is coming I tell em it ain't today
Okay I am G and bitch I'm a stress that
I'm the business, show me where the rest at
I got that nigga so where they next at
When they come to competition it's understood I'm a rip that
Speaking of fit I pick something the size of Texas
Catch one of these fuck niggas get brick and on some other shit
My [?] OG, it ain't opened for questions
It's serious like these diamonds and niggas flexin' on some other shit

[Hook](*talking*)
Yeah, (I was gon hold you down)

You know we here to make a few people famous
This time around it's iight bitch, so please pay close attention
You might here your name, it's iight bitch

[Trae]
I prolly wasn't shit to these hoes, just a year ago
Now I'm at the status, I ain't really trying to hear hoe
If I reminisce, these bitches prolly end up getting exposed
And I'll gladly be the first to tell ya, bout these roach ass hoes
And I kept it real with a few of em, time and time
Bottom line if I don't shine, then they subject to move around
But I know these hoes sick, now that I'm finally getting known
Bitch don't even waste your breath, you know I'm riding this alone
Some of you hoes be characters, getting in where you could fit
Now I'm feeling like Snoop, y'all bitches ain't shit
I'd like to give a special shout out, to that bopping bitch Michelle
On a hustle for the dick, and I dont think she plan to fail
I heard she 'pose to getting rich, at the rate she was going roaching for some ends
She went from sucking in a Altima, to fucking in a Benz
Damn I guess she getting it. and I ain't mad at her
But if you get inside my range, I'ma throw an empty can at ya broke bitch

[Hook: Dallas - 2x]
You just can't, trust a bitch
Hoes try to get you, trapped up and shit
You never know, with a hoe what you can get
So I let em know, and I don't miss these bitches

[Trae]
A hundred grand worth of ice, would have these hoes so crazy
Five cars and a house, will have her planning my baby
These hoes out to get it, like a nigga hitting licks
But the time they don't benefit, they gon quit
So I guess I got em mad at me now, cause they running they mouth
These hoes in last place, knowing they let me run in they mouth
So don't get too comfortable baby, I can give you the blues
So you scandalous trifling hoes, can go on and put on your shoes
Fascinated by shining thangs, and the reputation of stars
And she ain't tripping on me, she'd rather fuck my car
By far, I use to think a lot of hoes was real
Until I seen em fuck a nigga, to get they nails refilled
Now if that ain't the cheapest shit, then won't you tell me what is
What about em fucking with your partna, while you watching your kids
I know a lot of people feel me, from investing they time
But we gon let them bitches know, they out of line I hope you catch some'ing bitch

[Hook - 2x]

Ha-ha-ha-ha, you oughtta be ashamed of yourself bitch[Trae:]

Look Donnie I'm from a place we will fuck you up
In chase you down, the silva Roam nigga the lone town
Late night around this mutha fucka I ain't blew
No big backyards, no swimming pools
Just coke white t's man and dope money
We introduce the system trying take my life from me
I left my baby mama for another bitch
Young nigga trying creep on a another lick
Them white boys jump out on a nigga quick
Had to throw away a gun in another clip
They want me to go to church, but I'm not a saint
Ya homey a hypocryte, this what a nigga ain't
I squeeze triggers man them bullets fly
Right After that muther fuckers call homocide
If you don't put in work your stomach growl
Then they take you to trial, nigga you don't know what I been through

[Verse 2: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants
Before it's over, know somebody gunna have to come get me
And if I go some one gunna have to come with me
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you
Thugging for plenny days, thugging for plenny nights
With this shit in my trunk, dodgeing them colored lights
They say my life is dark, my future was never bright
Some people say I'm wrong, I tell'em ain't nothing right
I barely sleep when I do it's somewhere locked away
It ain't for long, I'm trafficing these blocks about a block away
Haters trying block this chopper, cocked they ain't gunna block today
Many blocks I got come up short they gunna get rocked away
My brother doing life, I told him I'd be coming for him
If my ass don't make it through this trip tell em it wasent for him
If I end up back on my ass everybody is dinner
You let me eat you get to live everybodys a winner
I'm in the bottom where devil even scared to come
And little homies keep artillery equipped with drums
Chea, all I know is I'm a make it bitch
They say this shit is for the taking, I'm take it bitch

[Bridge/Hook: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder

They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants

Right After that muther fuckers call homocide...
If you don't put in work your stomach growl...
Then they take you to trial, nigga you don't know what I been through

[Verse 2: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother...
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants...
Before it's over, know somebody gunna have to come get me
And if I go some one gunna have to come with me...
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you...
Thugging for plenny days, thugging for plenny nights
With this shit in my trunk, dodgeing them colored lights...
They say my life is dark, my future was never bright
Some people say I'm wrong, I tell'em ain't nothing right...
I barely sleep when I do it's somewhere locked away...
It ain't for long, I'm trafficing these blocks about a block away...
Haters trying block this chopper, cocked they ain't gunna block today...
Many blocks I got come up short they gunna get rocked away...
My brother doing life, I told him I'd be coming for him...
If my ass don't make it through this trip tell em it wasent for him...
If I end up back on my ass everybody is dinner...
You let me eat you get to live everybodys a winner...
I'm in the bottom where devil even scared to come...
And little homies keep artillery equipped with drums...
Chea, all I know is I'm a make it bitch
They say this shit is for the taking, I'm take it bitch...

[Bridge/Hook: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother...
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants...
Before it's over, know someone gunna have to come get me
And know if I go some one gunna have to come with me...

(And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you) [x2]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother...
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants...

And know if I go some one gunna have to come with me...
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you...[Verse 1]
Yeah
They tell me to be patient, I tell 'em them days is over with
You ain't feeling how I was feeling
Then why the hell you talking up in my face?
You better know the kid
Everyone judging me like a killer
I was [?] somehow, read the [?] of my mission
I did it out of love and love is what they missin'
I told 'em play it solid, but now I see they ain't listen
It's funny how them niggas the same niggas who dissin'
They better play it safe, I played it gangsta when it was tension
Holding on this toolie like somebody need them a fixin'
I don't trust shit, everywhere I look niggas switchin'
The fuck I kept it real when that part of it they was ditchin'
Shout out to my old bitch, I wish you the worst
Any feeling I thought I had I put that shit in a hearse
I'mma do this for every day that you was laughing at verse
Who laughing now? Underestimated, my worth, I'm good
Keeping it G with it, I get to you like I'm a feeling
Balling like Jordan and Pippen way back in '97
Reminiscing about all my niggas who made it to heaven
And all the ones I know didn't who needed the reverend
It's still love, God bless their soul
Every time I think about it that shit there cold
[?] with the pressure, still I will not fold
Nigga, I've been a king, now my crown covered in gold, for real

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know they hoping it was over for me
Yeah, check it, I know they hoping it was over for me

[Verse 2]
The industry of my city labeled me as an outcast
No Big or 3K, just me in this black mask
Nothing easy, I'm fainting like how long will this shit last?
Knowing they all together heaven toast with a shot glass
Fuck 'em though, I hope them niggas choke on a shoe [?]
Headed to the top, I know they hoping this coupe crash
I know they only live to count me out like loose cash
I'm rolling with my feelings tucked away like a [?]
Plus my attitude nothing here worth talking about
Nothing personal, just don't give a fuck what you talking about
Talking so tunnel vision, every day I was walking out
I'm sick of the pain, where the fuck he at? Let me call him out
I ain't looking for help 'cause ain't nobody gon' do shit
But watch a nigga sink it to ya they never knew shit
They play it like a snake infiltrating your cruise ship
Jealousy a disease and it spread like the flu, shit
I ain't dying, niggas' code ain't nothing like mine
Nowadays niggas get with you so they can talk down
Telling me it's love, but they hoping I get choked down
Everybody's wave's fucked up, I'm glad I caught mine
Got me feeling this my time, man, I'mma take it
Worth somewhere in the coma, I gotta wake it
Guess this shit part of my life, I can't escape it
I been aim high, it's time to elevate it, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know they hoping it was over for me
Yeah, I know they hoping it was over for me(*talking*)
Yeah, I know they ain't think I was gon let they ass make it
Motherfucker you must be stupid, put your game face on bitch
This first and ten, hoe ass niggas

[Trae]
Niggas acting like they forgot, I'm the reason the streets relaxing
I brought it back for the hood, to let some real niggas get action
I'm certified with these streets, so why the fuck is niggas asking
I been riding since I was 12, now the fuck you think I'm lasting
Watching niggas turn gangsta daily, cause they practice flashing
But talking against the Truth, will have em starving like they fasting
I fuck around and come just start up they career, dead then I'm crashing
Then have em just looking stupid, till every rapper come pass em
Say homie you better watch me, I'll show you how to do this shit
And tell them two-faces non-rapping ass niggas, stay off my dick
I can't believe these niggas ego's, that pump em up like they got beef
Lord knows if I get started, who the fuck can they get to stop me
This here's a warning shot, niggas better be on they A-game
I'm the leader of the gang, and I'm running with Lil' J mayn
I'm only here to win, if I lose then I ain't gon play mayn
I'm sick of asking niggas, who hating and they say mayn
Bitches ain't no better, but they got some'ing like they know me
They be the first to say they fucking got money, knowing they fony
These bitches worst than that gold digger, trying to get all up on me
Then they wonder why they five dollar, roaching ass by they lonely
I'm here to give em the truth, and reflect em like I'm a mirror
And fuck a new set of glasses, I'm helping you see it clearer
And if I spit it respect it, cause it ain't getting no realer
I been around the hood and back, and I stay posted up with killers
These niggas talking that hot shit, like Restless ain't what they banging
Knowing that when they flipping alone, I be what they singing
I got the Southwest on my back, so you know I know where you hanging
I know you contaminated, I hope you don't call it stinging
Even if I never see gold, the streets gon keep me paid off
And if I don't see platinum, I'll still never get laid off
Now who you think they ride for the trill, if shit didn't break off
Decided over here motherfucker, now watch you fade off

(*talking*)
I think you motherfuckers, picked the wrong nigga
On the wrong motherfucking day, on the wrong motherfucking block
Now you ass hoping it stop, but shit ain't gon stop nigga
You pumped your ass up, to fuck with the Truth nigga
I'ma give you the bidness, I can't do nothing less you know what I'm saying
This what it is, nigga know this shit go way back with me nigga
Holla at the motherfucking O.G. Dinkie, and see what the bidness is
This Asshole By Nature nigga, motherfuckers ain't worth no two verses
They ain't even worth a chorus, I'm play with ya you know
I'm having fun right now, but you piss me off
Your ass'll be starving out here nigga, fuck with me(Dallas)
Yeah uh, this is Dallas
Yaaaa-aaaay uh, du-du-du-du
Du-du-du-du-du-du, we got Trae and
We've been hustling, for a long

[Hook: Dallas]
I've been hustling, in this life of mine
Some of y'all, got a clue
See I've been grinding, in these streets
And I, finally got my break through
Mama told me, it's gon be iight
Lord if I, trust you
So I'm gon keep my eyes, on the final prize
See I got, my break through

[Trae]
I'm on a mission trying to get it, full time and I don't plan on losing damn
Why they don't wanna let me live, my life the way that I'm choosing to
Everyday it's a struggle mayn, went from sunlight to heavy rain
Everybody got some'ing to say, about me and mine but they don't feel my pain
Constantly, everybody wanna say what they've done for me
But I don't recall, y'all doing shit for me
I work hard one deep, all day all night and never no sleep
Only help that I got is God, all my family turning fraud
Only thing I got left for me is my son, since my life done got scarred
Mama told me niggas phony, get your change and be by your lonely
I never knew why until this day, still don't but the Lord'll show me
Inside this life of mine, I always knew it would be my time
So I've been hustling everyday, be on the grind for mine

[Hook]

[Dallas]
Some hit the spot, some the block
Some of y'all, don't know what to do
Some get your Glock, off your rocks
Just trying to make it through
But me I hustle on my music, I know how to use it
Do it to the best (beeest)
And me I'm all about my paper, me I gotta make it
Gotta make it last
I got to get my do', I got to get some mo'
Go to stay on my grind, I got to get mine

[Hook]

[Trae]
Ain't no telling when I'ma get my rest, with the stress that I'm facing daily
My people really trying to play me, but I'm real and they can not fade me
Time after time, and I'm breathing never leaving my time to blow is now
And who gon stop me on my move, and never let the block be out
Lose it it'll be my day, one day cause I've been patiently waiting
For everything I deserve, that's why they be hating
Like they don't wanna see me shine, they'd rather see my head pointed down
But I'm still gon do my thang, I got the chance and I'ma hold it down
I'm back for the first time, and I'm steady standing
And I went from bad to doing worse, but still I feel abandoned
That's why I'm next to gain the throne, and I'm bringing it home
Cause I've been hustling all my life, and I did it alone

[Hook]

(Dallas)
I'm hustling, all of my life I've been hu-
All of my life, all of my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-fe yeah yeah yeah
Ah no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no[Hook]
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive

[Verse 1]
They say death around the corner so I taking my aim
It ain't no point in tryna smile, shit I mastered the pain
Lost everything I love, what the fuck could I gain?
Clip dead everyday I'm seein' shit ain't the same
They told me hold my head up even if I'm ashamed
Why everyone I love leave, but somehow I remain
They either love ya or they hate ya, I'm just watching 'em change
That's why I converse with God while I'm doing my thing
J2 too got killed, damn lost him too soon
Looking at him at the wake, crying, wasn't immune
I know my little brother hurt, he barely come out the room
Somewhere blowing his brains out, probably high as the moon
I fell in love with a woman though I knew it was wrong
Went out and gave her my all, tried to make us a home
Went broke, looked up, why the fuck she was gone?
Momma told me it was coming, shit I wish she was wrong
She even took my baby with her, went the fuck on her way
And I can't even go and see him, I don't know where he stay
But regardless of the fact, he know his daddy is Trae
The way I'm feelin' make me wanna see the world with a K
Shit I barely get to see him two times out a month
I told Boss I'm goin' crazy I can't even much front
They say the road rough, must've been a hell of a bump
I got this banger on my lap, try to play me for punk, motherfucker

[Hook]
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive

[Verse 2]
I can't make it up out the streets like I'm doing a bid
Deserving a better day, but for they now they was hid
They got a nigga's road dog locked doing a bid
Even though my nigga gone, gotta take care of his kids
All these fuck niggas really got me fed, I'm through
Got me sitting trying to figure what the fuck did I do?
Me and niggas splitting up, where the fuck is the glue?
Other niggas turning snake, damn say it ain't true
M-U-G God damn that's cold
I'm on the way to the grave, gotta get it controlled
Seeing death after death kinda taking its toll
Even though I'm outta of luck I say fuck it and roll
Barely every get the the time I could kick it with Neek
Realizing the prayers count when he stands on his feet
He the reason I was fighting every day of the week
So I tell T.O. I love him, every time that we speak
Facetime late night with the D-O-G
Waiting on the court date to see what shit gonna be
If he ain't got shit left, he know he still got me
A-B-N nigga, L-I-F-E
I rather be hard than to be here sad
Tryna stop my little nigga before he go out bad
Tryna keep shit trill, same thing like Chad
I don't wanna see him get murdered tryna get that cash

[Hook]
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive

        (*talking*)
Ay Trae, I thought these niggas wanted to see us make it mayn
But I've been seeing otherwise mayn, but it's all hood though

[Trae]
I guess you niggas forgot, it seems to me that all of my niggas done lost they memories
We use to be so close, inside the same vecinity but shit done changed
It ain't too much clicking, we don't even see the same no mo'
We don't even hit the block to crawl, chopping up game no mo'
Where shit went wrong I really can't tell ya, but I can tell ya I sense it
On top of my game with a bird's eye view, ain't no way I'ma miss it
But when it's told throughout the hood, they say this nigga done changed
Cause I bought a car and bought a house, and got a few diamonds and thangs
But I'll be damned, if I don't get what the fuck I deserve
But I ask my family who I'm rolling, what about what's the word
About how we use to hit them shows, at about 60 deep
And if they don't get in, it's gon be a situation based out of heat
I guess jealousy envy and greed, come with the turf
You know realness is a given, nothing equals what it's worth
But time's flying, I don't feel I wanna get it back
Cause jealous motherfuckers, got me strapped for real

[Hook - 2x]
Damn it was all good, just a week ago
I see them niggas in the streets, we don't speak though
But damn it was all good, just a week ago
Jealousy got me focused, this some'ing you niggas need to know

[Yung Redd]
You can't ever, judge a book by it's cover
I'm only one in a million that came from the gutter, still I prayed for another
Way to get paid, once this street shit played out
A struggle for a hustle, is never a easy trade out
If money, is the root of all evil
My love for these niggas in the streets, runs deeper
Next second you're broke, look how these niggas treat ya
Six feet underground, still I'm my brother's keeper
I'm telling y'all, real talk haters get on your job
Most of these rappers fraud, see they only for sars man
They go for them niggas, riding your co-tail
Might as well throw in the towel, you're not gon sell
It's hurting ya to your heart, see us niggas prevail
All's well and ends well, with some weight in the scale
I'm here to cancel your plans, this one is for the fans
Yeah them fake ass niggas, I ain't stealing my hand naw

[Hook - 2x][Hook: MDMA]
Is it a lie? So you're not the one to blame
Or do you hide so you don't have to face tha pain?
Can you explain how you've come to change
Cuz I just don't get it... Noo-oo

[Intro: Trae]
I don't get it
Damn
It's crazy how the ones you look out for so quick to switch up on you

[Verse 1: Trae]
I never thought that I be filing like Gengo & get the best of me
I swear the only one I love be the pepole who testin me
I still can't figure where everything went wrong
They said they got my back, but now I understand that shit gone
Instead of standing up for what you did, you let me fight pain
And it was him or me never once that I complained
I just took it and smile, somewhere off in the rain
Knowin you wish I get the worst shit, I remain the same
You say I'm trippin, but the one we need to blame is you
Through everthing the only thang that change is you
Realizing that you ain't gon get it together
It's all far gone, it ain't no way to get better

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae]
Sometimes I question my self, asking what I did
I always thought I kept it without and what the fuck I did
I just keepin it real and tell your he truth is what made you
Run off and hide away and relocate to something new
They tell me time'll make hard I feel as rough as hell
I ain't shed a tears in a minute I ain't fill of not I wish you well
Your loyalty went out the windowl like a piece of trash
I probly'll never see it again (I probly'll never see it again)
Your ways are something like the wind, you're invisible for me
But at the same time how you rock is so visible to me
They told me misery loves company and that might be
And if it's true that ain't for me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae]
Take a look in a mirror and tell me what you see
Am I really trippin is evertyhing becasue of me
Or is the reality of it something you deny it
And everything you did you never done I just sit and to lie
Common you and I both know what I stand fo'
I look to you for help, but you reached out to let my hand go
It's all good you don't owe me nothing, bet that
Every table gon turn and that's the day you gon regret that
I know to strugle like the street that I'm roamin alone
Alone is how I get mi peace and now its my home
The shake of a hand, the only thing I can give you
I'mma live up to the lord to forgive you

Henny, Don P, and ‘tron on ice
I done damn near got them pissed at each other
Running out of time, ticked at each other
Running out of time, ticked at each other

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Hitting nothing when I pull up forward
Looking numbers but got an explorer
See you see it, know it, not me cause my money don’t need it
Durant with no gym, if I shoot bitch I’m scoring
King late night, ho come find out
I deep end dive in, when I finish I climb out
Giving me head, I call it blowing the mind out
If she ain’t bout action I might just put her in time out
I’m a player so I can’t choose
Got em searching for a nigga with the same clues
Pimp truth, me and Pimp got the same views
Fly with it like I’m Jordan, nigga same shoes
Anything she talking bout she better be about
If she not she walking out, I hate to see it
Bout that action, everything
No listing every way, you cannot stay
And that’s the way I’m raised

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She got a body of a goddess, hell of a night
Henny, Don P, and ‘tron on ice
I done damn near got them pissed at each other
Running out of time, ticked at each other

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
First came in dissing each other, now I got em all kissing each other
Want a coach and I just put em in
Phil Jackson shit, girl we gone win
Got the bait, I just reel em in
Section 8, now she to the top
She look better naked but she like to shop
Picture me and you in coupe without the top
Monday in the Duly, Friday in the drop
As I pull up valet, yo I keep my keys
Turned up like the 70s
Sex tape filmed in 7D

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I fucked your bitch and filmed it
Dolla $ign Spielberg
My life is a movie, shout out to my DJ
All I smoke is OG, motherfuck the police
Shout my nigga Trae tha Truth (H-Town, H-Town)
OG, all my bitches love me
Bitch I think I’m Gucci
Then she suck that dick up, I’ma eat that coochie
I like my cars drop top
At the light getting top, she going up

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She got a body of a goddess, hell of a night
Henny, Don P, and ‘tron on ice
I done damn near got them pissed at each other
Running out of time, ticked at each other

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
I’m in this night life, politicking
Politician, bet this ho listen
Pacific, no DC fishing
The play for Trae, ain’t shit here missing
Bitches with bitches, she send it over
She say she want rod I might pull it over
Tryna make me stand up while she bending over
Begging me to cum whip it like baking soda
Her nigga fucked up so I’m taking over
Look at that ass, she might get the business
Talking so much, you might never finish
The way you sit up, talking broke a Guinness
I’m like a four door old school
Double slide through the city, Truth so cool
Ain’t no telling what might happen when I roll through
I’m an asshole baby, ain’t no rules

[Verse 5: T.I]
I’m the king of the bankroll
Rubber band ain’t even gone fit that
Everywhere I go I see another stank ho
Asking me why I ain’t never hit that
Hit that bitch in the back of the trap house
See me and she holler out there how you gone act now
Run it, and like that I done it
Shove some’ fat into her flat stomach
I have no i-
Dea why the bitch gotta be so fly
And why the pussy so good, head so fine
Trying not to bust, nigga can’t hold out
All over everywhere
She hit me, I’m sending her checks just to get her there
I bet she leave that nigga there
Look at her underwear area
Long as the quanity’s quality, the more the merrier
Bet they break up like T-Mobile carriers
Told her, she thought that shit was hilarious
Thought that shit was hilarious
Shit, I’ma bend her over right quick
I’m sick of waiting on that pussy, finna go and get it over with
Put that ass in motion, and send her home to her man later on
He don’t know shitLet me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, I'm trying to maintain
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, can I do one thang
I see these niggas never satisfied, fucking with Trae
Everywhere that I go, these haters wanna put me away
But that's gon' be a hell of a job
I'm a mad dude, that's indignant by nature
Whether Trae or Frasier, don't come at me wrong
'Cause I'll blaze you
Fraud is what I rate you, when you turn to my foe
Ain't no second guessing or stressing, we ain't homies no mo'
The only true friend I got, is God himself
If you ain't him, you ought to think about guarding yourself
I can't be letting niggas take me off my game, I'm trying to be sane
And if I lose it, I'll introduce you to pain
I don't really think, you wanna take it there
I'll show you the meaning of life, is hard but it's fair
Deep inside, should I care? Prolly not
'Cause they don't wanna let me live
But if I'm rich on top, I bet these niggas wanna let me give
So I bled the smart way, living life all alone
'Cause these haters got me ready, to slap the side of they dome
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, I'm trying to maintain
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, can I do one thang
Lately the devil been riding my back, while a nigga sleeping
So much negativity around me, I attract demons
In the form of a fine ass bitch sometime
Who only purpose is to get me for my nickels and dimes
Interrupting my lavish, living with a 2-11
Will run up on Z-Ro, 1-8-7
(Mayday, mayday)
You about to witness my AK spray
You look tired, let me help you sleep your life away
Nigga, let me live my life
Nothing but drama, what these busters give my life
And I just can't rest
Got me depending on doja, to relieve my stress
Sometime I wonder if a nigga really blessed 'cause I'm still here
But I haven't lost my faith, my Lord, I still fear
Even though everyday, one of my people get killed here
I'ma keep on mashing toward the ribbon in the sky
All I wanna do is live until I die
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, I'm trying to maintain
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, can I do one thang
The way it look to me, is they got too much time on they hands
To be worried about my life and how I'm getting it man
You need to get your ass a hobby and get off of my back
Before you react the wrong way and make me attack
You ain't cut out for that
'Cause half the shit I lived in my life, you ain't ready fo'
I told you befo', you haters need to let it go
I keep it real too much, to let the devil do me in
I'm a child of God, with a fully loaded Mack 10
Trying to get out of my sins and to maintain
But it's like every thirty minutes, it's the same thang
Hate me for what, it's like I'm already stuck with a hard life
All my niggas that are gone and the others that turned shife
I can't live without you hating, so I feel like I'm forced
To get em gone and it's ugly, when applying my force
And I don't think you wanna know, what I can give
But I'ma give it anyway until they let me live
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, I'm trying to maintain
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, can I do one thang[Hook: Shyna]
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, I'm trying to maintain
Let me live my life, y'all know y'all ain't right
Niggas be so shife, can I do one thang

[Trae]
I see these niggas never satisfied, fucking with Trae
Everywhere that I go, these haters wanna put me away

[Z-Ro]
Lately the devil been riding my back, while a nigga sleeping

Who only purpose, is to get me for my nickels and dimes
Interrupting my lavish, living with a 2-11
Will run up on Z-Ro, 1-8-7
(May day, may day), you about to witness my AK spray
You look tired, let me help you sleep your life away
Nigga let me, live my life
Nothing but drama, what these busters give my life and I just can't rest
Got me depending on doja, to relieve my stress

[Hook][Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm unable to kick the bucket so I wake up to stress
Out of patience feeling like everybody else getting blessed
Took a breath, throw on my locs, get my pistol and vest
I'm in The Matrix dodging bullets 'til they put me to rest
I ain't happy to be here but I'm thankful I'm still alive
I need to be here for my son, Nico barely made it to five
Everything fading away in the dark when I step outside
I'm too lost to see where to go, I just hop in the car and drive
Mad, shit, as I think of my brother, Lord tell him I love him
Maximum security got it where I can't even hug him (damn!)
The devil hate me, but fuck it, I don't think nothing of him
I hate that bitch too, end of discussion (yeah)
He left me without a sister, just images of her murder
Knowing she cried for help, I'm just wishing I could've heard her
So related to the pain, the gutter love me like a son
That's why they say the only place that understand me is the slums
These don't problems don't go away (go away)
Cop him a spot and chill (spot and chill)
Duck off and go to sleep (go to sleep)
Wake up and show it's real (show it's real)
I take it for what it is, ain't no use in me trying to heal
I could be deep in my grave way up in heaven and feel it still
I'm kinda sick, the shit I'm on will lead to medication (fuck)
I'm on this road to life without no registration
I'm in this hall of shame like I had a reservation
The streets is dead, they overdue for a resuscitation

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uh, uh, HA-HAAAEEH!
Yo, it ain't one thing or another, either the law or ya baby mother (uh huh)
Dumping the clip, burning rubber (yeah)
Raised in the gutter, grew to be a shooter and the cutter
All the OG niggas love ya (ha)
But you know that there's more to discover (more)
And you getting tired of living your life according to others (uh)
Things going on in ya mind, you can't talk about
Soon as a nigga cross the line, you gon' chalk him out
Push-ups and crunches, never travel in bunches (nah)
Stay out of the sight of the cops, no hunches (yep)
Four Season brunches (ha), niggas with millions up in the hundreds (woo!)
Just being there will make you want this (come on)
Came a long way from the swim mobile and free lunches (uh)
To a whole song with three punches
With that being said, handle your fucking biz (yeah)
As long as the hood know what it is, life

[Outro: Female singer]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You gotta break me down(Chorus-L Boogie)
So many times I tried, you know I needed you by my side
But you left me alone for the ride, and I ain't mad at ya
We all know that life goes on-The pain inside got me singin this song
That's why I'd rather be on my own my on, and I ain't mad at ya

(Verse 1-Trae)
I remember fightin the pain till I was out of breath
But now I live my life, ridin alone like it ain't nothing left
Who'd ever thought I'd do a song to show you how I felt
I tried to keep it real but it ain't no need you only for your self
No matter how many times you turn your back I'm doin fine
It ain't my concern about you and yours, I just keep doin mine
Day after day my people told me you was outta line
You probably took your time, prayin to God that I would never shine, Life goes on

(Verse 2-L Boogie)
It's funny how the tables turned, comin from nothing to something(oh yea)
Hell I went through so many things, wouldn't give it up for nothing
And though I learn to survive it's like I'm losin my mind
Cause it's a cold, cold world that we live in
And I can't believe they tried to shit on me, but oh well-Life goes on

(Chorus-L. Boogie RP 2x)

(Verse 3-Trae)
I told myself it ain't no need for me to keep it real
Cause bein real is something that I see you just won't never feel
But I still do my thing and Lord knows I hate the pain
But I know it won't ever change, a G is what I'm gon remain
So I guess that I can't complain
It probably hurt your heart to see me get a piece of fame
But if you would've been down a hundred percent you would've got the same
No matter what I do it seem to me you kind of pissed
And I ain't mad at all you just another one on my list
So now I'm rollin in my zone, It might be lonely at the top but I'm comfortable on my own
I remember many days you was livin to do me wrong
Yeah you took me for granted but now you realizing I'm gone
It's another chapter closed and I'm movin on to the next
I use to stay up stressing but now it be easy for me to rest
It be the same situation when you come from the bottom
They love to watch you suffer, and hate to see you get it without 'em(it's a damn shame)

(Chorus Till The End)(*talking*)
Ah-ha, we doing it one more time ya heard me
Man the streets in me, the streets done made me
I grew up thugging, believe that
Me and Trae, we gon riot this year
Y'all gon respect that to the fullest, man look
We doing it like this here, check the peoples out man look

[Hook: Shyna]
It's kinda hard to maintain, living like a true soldier
Living life on the edge, has got me so caught up
It's kinda hard to maintain, living like a true soldier
Everyday is a test, and I just won't give up

[Trae]
I remember back in the day, I was confused as a child
And never thought that I would grew up, to be this wild
I'm living life on the edge, to maintain is my job
They wanna see me crack under pressure, but giving in this too hard
They better get they army to swarm me, thinking they taking me out
I been a soldier out the gates, so fuck what you talking about
Guerilla Maab till I'm leaving, Trae, Dougie D and Z-Ro
Call it what you wanna, you plex and you'll be six feet below
Cause I been insane living, ever since my brother was gone
Finally facing up with the truth, that he ain't coming back home
I know it's wrong moving on, and though it seems the game'll never change
I don't knock, I gotta be strapped with a shank and a Glock
Cause niggas be crucial on my block
And ain't no way they taking my stripes, I ain't going out without a fight
Unless they catch a nigga, sleeping in the night
And even still there ain't no killing me, even if I die
I bet the world fin to remember me, a real nigga from the streets

[Hook]

[T.C.]
I'm out chea cousin, rioting and thugging
You could catch me in the hood, grinding and hustling
The streets mad me, all the radios play me
Ain't no turning back, ain't no nigga could fade me
I'm still on a cash route, and I'm in a tight situation
Dog, the ball blast out
Still pulling masks out, at any time
Play with me whodi, you buy it and never find
Bitches make them cop calls
While my money keep the cops off, got Trae posted
With a Mack, 'case anything pops off
I'm a made man young hustler, ain't no wankster in me
When I riot duck, that's that gangster in me
Head buster, got them people talking
I'm playing with a six shot, I'ma fuck off this some whodi
Cause the streets too hot, too hot

[Hook]

[Trae]
Even nothing but the devil running me hot, and I'm going crazy
All the shit that I be facing, is what got me turning shady
They tell me to keep my head up, and it's easy for them to say
Cause they ain't going through what I'm through, each and every day
When you living like I'm living, and the block get bled
Running from the cops, praying them niggas never leave for dead
Cause I done seen it from every way, where the thugs and killas play
A nigga from around the way, that'll be strapped down with a K
And ain't trying to murder nobody, I just wanna live my life
And I can't focus on my life, when these motherfuckers be shife
And I be searching for another way, please watch over Trae
Heavenly Father guide me out, so I can live another day
I gotta hold on, everything I got on the line
Surviving is what I'ma do, so I'ma ride behind mine
Like it was all that I had, or it be all that I got
Even if I lose everything, it just ain't in me to stop

[Shyna]
I'm trying so hard, to maintain
Knowing my life, will never be the same - 2x

[Hook]

(*singing*)[Intro: Trae tha Truth]
I shine bright like a diamond, I shine bright like a diamond
I shine bright like a diamond, I shine bright like a diamond
I shine bright like a diamond

[Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond

[Verse 1]
What a wonderful fucked up life, looking to get some closure
Opposite of these fuck niggas trying to get exposure
Haters in violation, trust nothing of what they showed ya
Battle em til it's over, Trae going up like a soldier
Tell em I've been in the back
Sick of motherfuckers looking over this life of mine
My [?] is time to shine
To the point that they're going blind
I've been through so much my testimony say [?] look up
I got the hood, I hope the risk will hold up
Get this money til my desk can't fold up
I gotta win
Tried to close the door but I got up in
I done missed my shot then shot again
My time to go, I ain't stopping again
Know the road is rough but I'm a high beam
So many can get it and lose it
Not me, you gon' know when I choose it
You can tell em I'm determined to get it
And if I want it, ain't no way to refuse it
I told my grandfather I'll shine for em just like a diamond
Even though it's dark I told em spark the light and you can find em
For those who tried to shit on me, I'm right here to remind em
The true focus on moving forward like you can't rewind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
King of the streets, 13 bust tell em I've been that
Even though they left me missing
Tell them bitch niggas I've been back
I'm something like a diamond deep in the dirt but now I done rose up
You can close your eyes if you want, but in my presence shit get rose up
Position til I chose up, right after that go all in
Yeah then go get this work if they don't want it tell em call in
Nigga I'm a boss, you out here stressing tryna work for higher
You wanna be me, no listeril, what the fuck what it requires
Yeah, I shine bright like a diamond
I was promised to see the top and got to climb it on my way
Ain't no less than being great like Muhammad was speaking tree
All I know is handle business, if not then I'm in the way
And I take a team but niggas stop this lane of mine, I'm like nights in Manhattan
I'm in the game that make the plays, now they calling me Madden
And yes I love to make bitter
But I don't give a fuck, the world is mine and I'm gon kill her
For real nigga

[Hook][Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
It ain’t no game, when I rip it I rip it for the south
I’m in the sixty where these niggas’ll run in your house
They get that money, do they best just to run in your spouse
Late night, call it murder, they taking it out
Diamonds in the safe, got plenty more in my mouth
I’m in the kitchen cooking hard but I’m playing with soft
Pussy niggas [?], I’m here for the south
I’m only talking horsepower, you see the exhaust
Any time you see me movin’ I’ma swing on ‘em
I got the city on vibe, they gon’ flame on ‘em
I’m here to hurt a hater’s feelings nigga, pain on ‘em
I remember who I am, I never change on ‘em
ABN, gang gang, nigga checks up
Fuck niggas playin’ foul I’ma take somethin’
I tried to tell ‘em it was easy, I’ma break somethin’
Chain on, I’ma make they ass respect somethin’

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Catching plays in that four story loft
Broke nigga why you talkin’, where your boss?
Gimme everything, I don’t take a loss
Play with me and I’ma send ‘em through your mouth
Eight chains on like I’m in the chain gang
Lil breadwinner T on the same thing
Got me feeling so fly, I’m on the same plane
I know my niggas on lock, tryna maintain
I’ma hit ‘em with a [?], money on the books
All I ever knew was killers and a bunch of crooks
Got a thousand pounds of green and a bunch of books
They for the gram, I ain’t talking ‘bout a bunch of books
Still keep that money like Big Jew
Four cars full of niggas, what that shit do?
Late night, [?], still come through
This screwed up shit, ain’t nothin’ new

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Been gone, we had a real strong demo
Rap crew wasn’t [?] these, new rental
A nigga really got it, no trappin’, no cappin’
Bust a [?] homi, and it saved my package
Got an attitude problem and I’m real big-headed
Bring another bitch to fulfill this fetish
Man I know a lot of niggas wanna kill this
Still this shit that I’m kicking is the real [?]
Never gave two fucks, nigga stayed booed up
Nigga you ain’t drinkin’ lean, it don’t take two cups
You never comin’ with the money, want a date, booked up
They would shake down a nigga but they ain’t shook up
Not fakin’ now nigga, bitch you can’t fool us
Triple OG cool with the new-schoolers
Me and [?] shooting pool, motherfucking fool
Tell a bitch you ain’t shit if you ain’t get screwed upWhen im lost u save me from danger
From my recovery help me wit my anger
Faith to believe  you rescue me from felling grieved
Salvation wat this means your love and joy wat you bring
Your lords of lords kings of kings i believed yes i believe
All things are possible its god everday you strengthen me
Thru all the obstacles you purchase me back redemption now im free
From the enemie i been set free thank you lord for rescuing me[Hook]
I just can't take, this shit no more
I feel I'm losing my mind, but still I can't let go
The pain inside of my chest, about to make me blow
So run inside of my range, and I'll be forced to let go

[Trae]
I can't take it, I feel I'm losing composure
My attitude done got me clicking, but fuck it cause I'm a soldier
Lately I've been on that other shit, like a mad dude
Stressing over my brother, living in penitentiary blues
Never shed both tears, but I'm keeping a clip for them haters
With any reason opening fire, on a bitch made traitor
I've been falling off in my zone lately, and if one of these nigga
Run up on me, then I'm letting em have it baby
And it ain't no if and maybe's, so shady with the way they living
If willing I'm drilling, dealing with bitches that got me sinning
I'm trying to cope, but I feel like they really wanna bring it out me
When how many niggas out here, say they down and I know they doubt me
It's fucked up, but I'mma pull a maneuver
Bobbing and weaving, and run it to you
Hard times, got me mentally ready to bring it to you
Cause I'm young black and broke, with hopes of getting paid
You better disperse, cause I feel like I wanna spray bitch

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
You can't assassinate my character, whispering words of war
But I'm fed up with you son of a bitches, you've gone too far
Making a mockery out of my name, ain't cool
So I'm straight to the horse's mouth, me and my motherfucking tool
I love nothing and slug something, every twenty minutes
Fuck with me and the murder scene, just can't be prevented
I'm hell bound, will I be punished for thinking this way
A problem child of reason, I'm smoking and drinking today
Joseph, Douglas and Fraiser, we the niggas who made you
Fuck us over, and can't nobody save you
I'm the truth, mark ass niggas get a loosing in they tooth
Get murdered in the streets, the way to get murdered in the booth
I'll ride for my niggas, and I'll die for my niggas
It ain't shit to let my 45, fly for my niggas
Take a ride for my niggas, to the swamps and back
So bear witness, to the motherfucking pumps I pack bitch

[Yukmouth]
I can't stand the pain, I can't stand the rain
Taking penitentiary chances, moving grams of caine
I snatch your chain, run in your house and grab them thangs
Hit the block like Ro and Trae, with them slabs of bang
Stay on the grind, twenty-fo' sev'
Don't make me turn this 211, to a 1-8-7 one in your head
Street sweeper, 2-2-3's to capitate your legs
Break your legs, like Kujo to shake the FED's
I break bread with my goons, cause the streets gotta eat
And if it ain't no food on the streets, a dog show his teeth
I'm a beast, fuck a freak go to sleep with my heat
Creep stay on my feet, ain't no mercy for the weak
Fuck you geeks, I'm trying to stretch this dope like yeast
Fuck the police, I go to court smoking a sweet
Talk shit, like 50 Cent I'll put a hole in your cheek
I roll deep with the Guerilla Maab, I'm down for the beef nigga

[Hook]

[Trae]
Deep inside, I see they got a nigga spitting these verses
I got to get, but still it seem like I was blessed with the curses
And deep inside, I know nobody give a fuck about me
So stay the fuck from round me, cause bitch you tend to bring it out me
I heard some niggas looking for me, on the other side
And if they come, I bet
They run into a homicide
Sending them slugs, and they won't stop until they get inside
Animosity in my chest, done got me spitting wide and I ain't lying

[Z-Ro]
Friends turn into foes, and foes turn into memories
No mask when I ride, to make sure a nigga remember me
My name bring pain, to the soul of a busta
Cause it's more than a concussion, when I touch a motherfucker
(forever Guerilla Maab), and it's gon be for life
And it be retaliation, then it's gon be tonight
I wish a nigga would, run up and be laying it down
Locate his neighborhood, high ball and I'm spraying it down

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
Huh, I guess these bitches thought they couldn't get it either
Shit, they get it worse then a nigga
Thought I forgot about everything huh, ain't shit changed
Still a Asshole By Nature, get on now bitch

[Trae]
I guess you thought that you was home free, with that shit that you did
Motherfuck your feelings, plus your bitch ass ain't just like a kid
Now I could recall way back in the gap, they told me I wasn't nothing
Look at me now, when I pass your ass on 24's that I'm strutting
I guess I came to my conclusion, niggas and bitches be the same
All you motherfuckers ain't shit, they ride your dick to get your change
Only change you get from Trae, is how I'm treating your ass
Don't hit my phone, better call that nigga who be beating your ass
And by the way, I really love the way that you try to hop fly
Bitch I don't smoke, but if I did you'd prolly be blowing my high
So catch this middle finger, and put that bitch somewhere you don't want it
I'm worth a mill at the least bitch, I know you hate that you don't it
But now I'm laughing at your bitch ass, cause you know that you gone
I know the shit that hurt the worst, is that you know that you gone
And that's a damn shame, and I bet you wish that I would take it the worse
But dig these blues, your trash ass just worked one verse

[Hook - 4x]
All that I know, is I really don't love no bitch

[Yung Redd]
You know what it is, you know how I live
It's no other way, but G
Shorty I'm so street, like the concrete under your feet
When I was broke, it was hard to see yourself with me
Listen, this time I got the upper hand
Black on black 7-60, low pro rubberbands
Understand, for them athletes I play the back seat
You love them niggas on your TV, but that's me
Overtime, all them hoes I charm
Came back with hopes, that I had open arms
But naw not at all, Yung Redd got it all
And the last thing, I need is a broad
I'm so large, I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
P-I-M-P, is what a bitch show me
Ay I'm paying my dues, you paying a tuition
But my hoes playing they position, I'm pimping

[Trae]
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
Cause, I don't love no bitch - 2x

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
You can quit, calling my phone
Cause I don't love no bitch - 2x[Hook]
Mama

One more, yeah

[Verse 1]
(Give me one more day)
Ain’t nothin’ promised to make it
Mama, no need to panic
I’m tryin’ to get to the money
The struggle is cinematic
I just need 24 hours
Tryin’ to finish what I started
Conversin’ with these half nuts
City of broken hearted
At times you say I’m dead wrong
I’m just tryin’ to get that house for ya
I remember days ahead
Then nothin’
I’m gonna work it out for ya
(Work it out for ya)
I’ve never been a loser
I’m just tryin’ to provide
I heard the road got kinda rough
I’m just here for the ride
(Uh)
This pistol loaded
Only ‘cause these n*****
Broke and jealous
S***, I was broke as hell
Just sussin’ for a fortune tellers
Never depend on what these n***** do
Do yourself, and I been doin’ me
Around the clock like it was nothin’ else
This money comin’
Like a rumor full of bad news
I gotta get it
While I’m still holdin’ my last spoons
(Last spoons)
Ain’t no losin’ my mind
Even if I’m losin’ mine
I’m out tellin’ it
As we speak
No point in losin’ time

One more day
Give me one more day
That’s all I need
Give me one more day

[Verse 2]
I’m searchin’ for better days
Tryin’ to get back on track
Watch over my kids for me
In case I don’t make it back
I knew it’d be hard to sleep
Pray we goin’ make it through it
You say you want somethin’ greater
One day I’mma take you to it
Lost in the city
Takin’ precaution
Haters on radar
(Radar)
I know I ain’t exempt
Slippers count
That’s why I stay far
I don’t plan on
Lettin’ ‘em get the best of me
Not today
Fight her ‘til it’s over
On everything, I’mma make her wait
(Yeah)
Somebody goin’ give me this
I feel like I’m built to get it
Nobody mess this up
We make it
Then I’m goin’ quit it
I know my brother doin’ life
That’s your oldest son
And Lowry died when I was young
That’s the coldest one
(Coldest one)
Gimme a pass
I gotta handle what
I came to do
This one for the family
But on top of that
It’s me and you
You told me have a plan
And, sis, I do

Mama, please forgive me
For everything
I pray you do

One more day
Give me one more day

[Verse 3]
Listen, please forgive me
I know I said it would be different
But I get up out that prison
I would never start back up trippin’
Never
And I mean it
On my kids, I was with it
Many tried, but I swear
My pride died last Christmas
She ain’t even bought a tree
Bought no m*****f*****’ presents
No, my kids special
They deserve to get whatever
(Babies)
Yeah, all that pressure
I had to go through what I know
Once I get us out this [?]
I won’t do this s*** no more, baby
(Uh)
You and mama stop stressin’
And just trust me
I’mma be okay
I’m a veteran

Soon as we get a plate
I swear to God I’ll quit hustlin’
S***, I gotta do somethin’
Pray for me

One more, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah(*singing*)

(*talking*)
Yeah, you niggas know what time it is around here mayn
Yeah we still on that hood shit, just had to take this shit
To another motherfucking level, know I'm saying
Trae, Mya huh we bout to set it off round this motherfucker

[Trae]
Bout time they make way for another guerilla, these other niggas ain't the truth
Come down to the bottom of the map and holler at Trae, and these niggas gon give you the proof
I roll with a entourage of them Assholes, on 24 inches of chrome
And plus the baddest lady Mya, to help a G get in his zone
Lately I've been getting slipped up, till they see that black on black with something packed
The back of the frame, to show these niggas how to act
I'm from the South, where we known to look good in our mouth with diamonds shining bright
It's Screwed Up Click to the death, with niggas crawling slow with purple Sprites
We thugging baby, the corners we hugging daily we grind
Through the day and night, ain't no sleeping for nothing baby Slow Loud when I bang
And don't confuse me, cause the game ain't what it need to be
'Less you like bullshit music, from them bullshit niggas on T.V
I call it how I see it, ain't no other way that I feel is real
Don't think they real as Pac, just cause them niggas done sold a couple of mill
And a deal don't make you, just because your label ride your dick
We been here paying dues, it's just a matter of time before we click

[Hook: Mya]
Baby don't you worry bout a thang, see everything's gonna be ok
Cause I'ma be right by your side, while you on the grind
Just keep it hood, keep it gangsta
Get that change, make that paper
Keep it moving, stack them dollas baby
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
So I'ma do what I gotta do, to get mine

[Trae]
I knew it, but I bet they thought that they could keep me here to wait
But now it's time, that I introduce the world to Trae
One of the hoodest out the H, a ghetto legend and the next to be
Plus my swagger, got me at the status of an original G
24's on my truck, haters better duck and get the fuck out of my range
It ain't gon be a pretty sight, if they wanna try to come stop my change
Cause I'ma ride or die with Mya, two of the same so we a team
And anybody disrespect it, watch how much drama I bring
And watch how much diamonds I bling, when the grill get in they face
And if my gangsta on the line, just watch how fast I'ma win the race
And I don't think they want it baby, we 1 and O for the belt
Now everytime we spit together, just know that we gon be felt

[Hook]

(*singing*)

[Mya]
I know you feeling really anxious, when I'm on your side
But can't no other replicate ya, so you ain't gotta think twice
See I'ma hold it down for you, do what I gotta do you know how we do
So don't you worry bout a thaaaang, it's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, so I'ma do what I gotta do to get mine

[Hook][Intro: Pusha T]
You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money

[Hook: Pusha T] x2
Millions-millions in the ceiling

Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
King of the streets, I’m killin on it
Brand new coupe, no ceiling on it
Wrist way cold, no feeling on it
So much ice I’m chilling on it
New crib, new yacht, put a million on it
Money stacked up, looking like a building, don’t it?
32 4 brick, no dealing on it
Land of the odd, no drilling on it
Got a Cuban bitch stud like a playboy wife
The same time with dick, I might play the night
She like to blow, under the play the mics
She know the game is over, she don’t play it right
Never seen the sun but some say I shine
These jackers talkin, I don’t it mind
New P90 stay fully loaded
Come fuck with me and I’mma vervine
Nigga I’m too real for these hoes
White alligator – these doors
Trunk go up, it don’t close
Woman on my grip with these foes
Got morbid flows for my toes
Had to be the reason why I end up toast
Probly no shit, don’t list a real
I’m certified hip, can’t fuck with those

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
This that shit that y’all wanted
This shit cook up hard, don’t it?
Y’all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don’t it?
Yuugh, I’m tired, nigga and y’all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I’m paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks
I restore the feelin’ of when niggas made a killin’
Hidin’ choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin’ loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have ‘em shittin’ on all they bitches, ah!

[Hook: Pusha T] x2
Millions-millions in the ceiling

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I’m haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I’m cryin’ sayin’ his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger ’til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman’s, niggas committin’ treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I’m the shit

Choppas-choppas in the closet

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
This that shit y’all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain’t much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch, I’m just keepin’ y’all on y’all toes
Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin’ of when niggas made a killin’
Hidin’ choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin’ all y’all bitches

[Hook: Pusha T] x2
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling

[Verse 1]
Passenger side with talc in this brief
We the reaper
Who, in the morning
Predominantly black
Got the seether
But I ride
‘Bout my business
In the zone
Thinkin’ ‘bout past times
Every one of mine
That I done lost
Hood for the last time
No smokin’ and drinkin’
I’m sober
I gather faces
Like this bitch
Goin’ here first
Way down below
She gather faces
But until the lil’ [?]
To try to fight it
Go ahead
Embrace it
I’m a shine
Representin’ for my niggas
You can’t replace it
I’m just doin’ what I do
And what I do is keep it gangsta
Reppin’ for the place
Where you get snitchin’
They hang ya
Them from the jungle
Where it’s wild
And they can’t tame ya
Get ‘em back for what they done to yours
Can’t no one blame ya
I’m in the lead
Like Harden
I beg ya pardon
Better watch what you gonna say
‘fore I send you somewhere you starvin’
The homies on the green
Talkin’ no g
Fresh out their garden

You washin’ on the planet
Like you [?]

[Verse 2]
Remiscin’ ‘bout robbin’
They did some money clip
[?] and my brother
Who’s stuck in the cage
Doin’ life in the pen
They take WK
One day I see you again
Until then, I’m gonna jump off
In this shit and hustle the win
Them that got me tempted
To sip somethin’ then drift away
On the cool, you know I’d be lyin’
There won’t be shit today
Gotta stay the truth
And the truth is
I’d deal with it
Tryin’ to keep my cool
But if you trip
Just know you’ll still get it
The shoes I got on steal
Figured I gotta hold it down, homey
Fend it like a champ
And take it off
For me and mine, homey
You ain’t worried ‘bout the risks
I’m out here ownin’
For me and my homies
Live to reminisce
‘Cause in this life
You can’t rewind, homey
Frisk test when it’s time
To let the pain cry
(Cry)
Barely made it out the bottom
So I aim high
(High)
And I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout the smoke
I’m talkin’ visionary
Crucify the slayer
Top back call it missionary

[Chorus]
Hey, smokin’ and sippin’
I been going through some shit
Gettin’ high reminiscin’

Smokin’ and sippin’
Dah, dah, dah[Hook: Snootie Wild]
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
All the shit that I did, all the shit that I seen
Lord can you forgive me? Guess he forgave me
Cause look how he made me
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
All the shit that I did, all the shit that I seen
Lord can you forgive me? Guess he forgave me
Cause look how he made me

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I remember many days I was somewhere on my own
Praying “ah god let me see your plan”
Everything happen for a reason
Even though certain shit I probably would never understand
Now I pull up in the hood something all black with a foreign name, I'm king of the land
With a motherfuckin attitude and a bunch of heaters on me
Pussy niggas better have a fan
I’mma be a real nigga till I gong out
Ridin' for the hood till the wheels blown out
Streets mean what the fuck you wanna know about
In the trap still tryna get this load out
Fast money I would never take a slow route
Ten bricks with a chopper on the fold out
I recommend you role with it or get rolled out
I dedicate it to the niggas who done sold out
I guess I was chose
Bitches openin my doors
I am the shit, no need to check your nose
Every bitch I want comin out their clothes
Asshole habits hustle like a savage
Shit round my neck bitch nothing 'bout it average
Open up the safe you would think it’s full of cabbage
Shit, probably why a fuck nigga would never manage

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
All the shit that I did, all the shit that I seen
Lord can you forgive me? Guess he forgave me
Cause look how he made me
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
All the shit that I did, all the shit that I seen
Lord can you forgive me? Guess he forgave me
Cause look how he made me

[Verse 2: Que]
Caught a case back in '08 nigga, I was seventeen facing three years
Cut a few niggas off that were bringing me down
Now I’m on top like three lid
Why you never really see a nigga trip out, pray this shit gon' really out, blessed to be here
I’m just a nigga from the slum, now I’m rich with a get-money gut like a nigga drink beer
Made it out the hole, almost ended off the road
Now I’m on and out the road state to state doing shows
Came a long way from kicking doors, stealing nigga bowls
Or sleeping on the floor
And walkin' to the store
Now I might pull up in a roll when you walkin on more
Whoever knew that the streets did take me this far
Used to rock G-shocks now I might rock the rollie or flaunt that Audemar
Bosses be the magic used to make Paris
Now I got Houston just to order seafood salad
Thank god for the times that a nigga did struggle
(Everything happens for a reason)
That what made my hustle now a young nigga vision just stuck on top
(Money over everything)
I was piecing out the puzzle now a nigga diamond wet like a puddle

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
All the shit that I did, all the shit that I seen
Lord can you forgive me? Guess he forgave me
Cause look how he made me
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
Never knew, never knew, never knew these streets would take me so damn far
All the shit that I did, all the shit that I seen
Lord can you forgive me? Guess he forgave me
Cause look how he made me[Z-Ro]
Don't come around my way, cause I don't need a
'Nother fair weather friend, with a trick up his sleeve
Acting like you really my nigga, but he after my cheese
Y'all niggas get me congested, move around and let me breathe
I remember when you niggas, ain't want me to hit the weed
Now that I'm rapping, you see me and tell me to hit the weed
Thinking you can get a VIP pass, and get in free
But Joseph McVey, is enough company for me
Wanna kick it with me, cause I kick it with the high class
Y'all didn't wanna kick it, when I was down on my ass
In my cordoroy britches, y'all was in Louis Vuitton
Laughing and pointing at a nigga, trying to ruin my fun
For using the millennium, or money by the ton
You niggas ain't help me get it, I did it with no one
Fuck showing love back, I ain't showing none (y'all niggas don't have to)
Come to none of my shows, or buy none of my tapes
Cause with or without your support, I'mma still be straight
The less niggas around me, the better I can concentrate
When I can't think straight, I open up a chest plate
It could be ya death date, get beside yourself
We ain't cool, I think you better rewind yourself
Before a cemetery, be where you can find yourself
So beat your feet, and let the do' close behind yourself
I don't need no friend, I don't need no broad
Only thing I need, is the help of the good Lord
Trying to kick it, but motherfuckers sing to hard
Cause I'mma be keeping it real, they gon be keeping it fraud
A hundred and fifty-two percent, are real with me
So instead of keeping my niggas, get the steel with me
I can do bad one deep, so I chill with heat (fuck y'all niggas)

[Hook]
I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

[Trae]
I'm a asshole, and I ain't trying to be rude
But I don't really give a damn, about none of y'all
You use to hate a nigga tough, from way back in the day
First off, fuck each and every one of y'all
I be a loner on my own, alone hang with my chrome
These motherfuckers play, life so fraud
I peep game, to the T
Cause I don't want nobody, to catch a nigga slipping on the Boulevard
And on the other hand, just to make matters worse
I feel, they want me headed to the grave
And I ain't ready to leave, I got my back planted against the wall
With a nine, about to misbehave
Same old shit, with a friend or a foe
Pack your shit, and get the fuck out the do'
Ain't no way, you hoes finna be a part of my life
A.B.N, is all that I know
You can try what you wanna, but I ain't gon fail
Look at me now, and all the shit that I sell
I'mma beat a nigga trunk off, coast to coast
And everybody who doubt that, can go to hell
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
And I don't give a fuck, cause I'm in my zone
All that hate you got, it only make a nigga strong
So I like how it feel, when I'm left all alone

[Hook]

[Trae]
You must of thought I forgot, when I was stuck on the block
And I was broke, everybody laughed a lot
And now the tables have turned, you niggas fraud
And you know see Trae, with his foot up on the gas a lot
Cause I don't trust you niggas
Give me fifty feet, 'fore I rush you niggas
Move it around, cause I don't fuck with you niggas
To tell the truth, I'm allergic to you niggas
Asshole for life, until a nigga fly
Nigga don't stop, better go on pass by
And hoes, don't call my cellular phone
The only thing, that y'all know how to do is lie

[Z-Ro]
Why y'all niggas wanna rob wanna steal, that ain't real
How the fuck I'mma kick it with you, you ain't gon get me killed
I done seen a lot of blood, on the battlefield
Even though I'm tired, I be climbing up the ladder still
Ain't nobody words gon hurt me, even if they dessert me
I'mma still be grubbing, and drink a drink when I'm thirsty
Just to be in my position, motherfuckers ain't worthy
So they feminine conversations, don't even disturb me
I'm a gangsta, don't need another nigga to grade me
If I'm in trouble, don't need nobody to save me
Steady losing composure, like my kon folk Trae be
I'mma handle my bidness, ain't no buts, ifs or maybes

[Hook - 2X]Home niggas bow down, I’m asshole number 1
Tell ‘em I don’t really give a fuck
In an all-black Porsche legs been locked on my seats
If I get ‘em ain’t no pull I’m tryna plu-plu-pluck these niggas
Maybe either one about is pussy
Matter fact tell ‘em give it up but I put your hands up
Trae here to shut this bitch down and I already teared these niggas ass up
Wussup? You lookin’ at the realest nigga livin’
Yea I’ve been that since birth ‘til I end up in a hearse
Nigga I’m the king of the streets
I’m the king cuz I say it’s my turf
But it ain’t put a nigga in the paper like Lisa’s Michael
Put the whole club under water – what cycle?
Eyes on me when I walk on these gates
With a bitch outside – shotgun, no riffle
When I’m done she gets swapped up
Niggas in our pussies so they get beat up
My swag crack but I’m locked up
Tell you everything – you get beat up
Down there so loud, nigga they ain’t never gotta speak up
Put a nigga bitch face down tell to eat up
Until I finish up don’t fuck a nigga seed up
Look I ain’t really got time just beat up
Coop of the wrist ain’t cover champagne
Certified champ, motherfuckin’ nigga rain
Something like Dwayne Wade, LeBron James
Elections, join a real nigga campaign
Niggas pissed that I’m on
It’s like I can’t get turned off
They asking why my voice sound like that
I tell the motherfucker I’m the south

Real niggas say word
I ain’t never told no lie, I ain’t never told no lie

Every time a nigga weird as if a nigga gotta hit the stand
I ride for my niggas I die
Real nigga say Truth like they keep yelling my name
Yea, they keep yelling my name
I was only in the hood, tell ‘em I ain’t never gonna change

Only pull up on the block with something to cruise
Yeah I gotta run nice just look at the shoes
On the cool Tell them haters they got it confused
Tell em go against me I bet he gon loose
Niggas talking bout they move but I’m holding the crown
How you speaking for the streets & you running around
Go to disrespecting me & I’m walking em down
When it come to competition they’ll never get found
I know they mad cause they know they ain’t better then me
Every diamond on me water who wetter than me
Look at me I guarantee I’m the level to be
Better know it’ll never be pressure to me

Back for the throne ain’t nobody gon sit in my seat
I should’ve been the contractor for Heat
They know the truth be demolishing beats
I will not stop I feel I’m on a mission

Moving through Houston something like a Goat
Go against that you’ll be on a coalition

[Outro: Trae Tha Truth]
Don't fuck wit me nigga
Don't fuck wit me nigga[Verse: Trae Tha Truth]
No point wishin to live, when you shit out of luck
I'm just prayin to make it out, can't end up stuck
What's loyalty where I'm from, you sell it for a buck
In my crew, sometimes, we just go off, don't give a fuck
Up to zone 6 with Gotti, I remind ya
Keep them snakes from round ya, it's a cold world, nigga
And even some pussy could fuck up your whole world, nigga
Never made a point to keep my old girl, nigga
I'm just givin it to you straight, no kerl, nigga
Tryna help the homie, he done caught him a body
Bout to catch him a chain, now he feel like he Gotti
No matter the situation, all they know is they got it
Fuck the costs of doses, he know he got it
I guess everyone, they riding now
Murder, they sliding now
Move into position, real bitches they hiding now
Only thing they know is they the one to stand
Never been excited about love, rather be alone
Used to say bitches don't matter, you the one who proved me wrong
Repeat it like a song, repeat it till I can't no more
When it's over, it's over, can't go on no more[Intro: Trae]

Let me talk to them
You need to pay attention to the truth
You know it's here
For every death, brings new life
And with new life
Our chances are limited
They say it's limited by the experiences
That we may come across on a day to day basis
It's limited by the circumstances, of us being less fortunate in life
They say it's limited by the spirit and hope we have
That everybody try to take from you
But then it's unlimited when you find peace with god

[Verse 1: Trae]

Come take a walk through the hood with me
Where faith is at a lower level cuz pressure is hard
30 years in a cell will leave a killer acquainted with God
Going to war with pain will leave you internally scarred
Watchin' the world crash is kinda odd
We in the last days is what they tellin' me
8 year old children bein' convicted of a felony
Never had a life stereotype is what they bred to be
Momma dead, daddy prolly somethin' they will never see
The economy under fire by President Bush
That's why they hood spend most of their days
Blowin' president kush, the way he got us daily
Give us a reason to push unless he on the verge of suicide
And we gave 'em a push
Katrina came and left our neighbors wit' some deadly weather
And off the rip I beg the lord to try to make it better
I feel they pain so now I ride wit' them like it's whatever
Yeah I represent for New Orleans and Texas together
I got a kite the other day from my homie's on lock
They beg me not to switch up like rest. Look here
Homie I'm not (You know I got you)
So every chance I get to roll I'm coming the block (I'm coming the block)
I'm in these penientary walls, till they tell me to stop
I witness murder by the minute on another skill
Sirens and a couple shots mean another body still (Body still)
Even if we see it rules, got us unable to tell
My Heart goes out to all those victims who done been thru hell
Children molested by these cowards who ain't in at all
As long as I'm living, I ain't gon' let these cowards win at all (Ain't gon' let them win)
And for my people I'mma stand up till a soldier fall
I'm so serious, ain't no need for me to grin at all
And on another note, my girl homie momma is a smoker
I promise I wanna help but she duck off when I approach her
I'm so sensitive to the pain that I'm numb
Put the world against me, on my babies I ain't finna run (I ain't finna run)
And speakin' of babies, I'm seein' babies havin' babies
Ho ass niggas skeetin' in these kids like they grown ladies (They goin' to hell)
They tell me life gon' get better if Obama win (If Obama win)
I agree as long as he don't switch up in the end (Switch up in the end)
My brother been in the pen a little over ten
I gotta send him pictures just to help 'em live again
I let 'em know there's no limit how far this end extend
If I gotta die to see 'em free, then I'll be checkin' in
That's on my spirit homie...

[Verse 2: Lynzie Kent]
The vultures are coming
Their hunting for your blood
Their circling the streets
But don't give them what they want
But don't give them what they want
And I know you got a secret
And it's causing you pain
So lay low baby
It won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again
I look through these eyes
And these eyes only
I live through this life
Sometimes it's lonely
I look through these eyes
And these eyes only
I Live through this life
Sometimes it's lonely
Sometimes it's lonely
My life...
My life...(Chorus)
I get money - I get, I get money - I get money, it ain't nothin to a boss nigga
I get money - I, I, I, I get money, I get money it ain't nothin to a boss
I get money - I get, I get money - I get money, it ain't nothin to a boss nigga
I get money - I, I, I, I get money, I get money it ain't nothin to a boss
I get money - I get, I get money - I get money, it ain't nothin to a boss nigga
I get money - I, I, I, I get money, I get money it ain't nothin to a boss

[Verse 1 - Trae]
Picture me posted on the corner, my pants saggin below my ass
With somethin weighin down my pocket, from people countin my cash
I'm a hop inside the drop and let the top down, and squat down
Then I make 'em pump they brakes like I'm a stop sign
Told you I rhyme gangsta, I got it locked down - Houston, Texas my home
My paint stay wetter then a bitch - on this nice selection of chrome
And if I ever choose to roam homey, I'm good where I go
Better ask yo'favorite ghetto star, how I get down on the low
My hustle fuh sho, when I'm gettin this dough
You better believe if I talk about it I got it to show
My neck and wrist enough to drop a hater jaw to the flo'
And don't worry bout the price it cost bitch I got money to blow
It's nothin to a boss!

(Chorus)

[Verse 2 - Slim Thug]
I make the money but don't let the money make me
But my money make alot of haters hate me
'cause I'm a shine, I ain't tryna tone shit down
I'm a put it in they face and show I'm paid now
I'm livin laid now, use to be broke strugglin
Till I got up off my ass and started straight hustlin
Got out and got it on my own, wasn't gave nothin
You ain't heard that lil'young nigga stayed thuggin
Went from the streets, to the beats now I'm makin hits
Momma happy cause her son gettin paid legit
I been the shit mayne, before the paper came
You can take away my money, but can't take my game
I'm the boss nigga, gyeah....

[Verse 3 - Trae]
Now in the hood I'm gettin paid - slam butterfly do's
Gettin money just guarantee me a bunch of fly hoes
So I choose to let 'em have it, it's evident talk is cheap
I put about thirty in my mouth so now they feel me when I speak(yeah)
I'm Trae Tha Truth you better go ask 'em who the streets
And ask 'em who that, in that black on black with ostrich sittin on the seats
My money speaks plus I'm surrounded by a couple freaks
I'm so much in my zone I ain't been home in bout a couple weeks
They use to tell me I was broke, I told 'em not for long
And pulled up on they ass in somethin, that cost bout forty stacks alone
See in these streets I'm like the president ridin on chrome
Saggin my ceasers with my t - shirt on - like I'm a boss

(Chorus Till End)[Verse 1 - Trae Tha Truth]
All black whip but the flow kick
I'm the King of the streets, what you know bitch
If you say I ain't the King, you don't know shit
Yeah nigga, other niggas doing ho shit
Greenlight everybody on go bitch
Bitch in the backseat tryna blow shit
But I'm on some mo shit, run up in yo door shit
Tryna get this money, everybody on they floor shit
I'm on the ?, strapped like John Wayne
Then put a price on your head for a little change
I can bomb a nigga block with a little aim
Bout to Dedicate a 5 like Lil Wayne
I'm on that OG Bobby Johnson shit
In a drop ?, I'd done lost my shit
Niggas say you on, like a bunch of bright lights
My niggas tryna off ya shit
I burn a bitch up, no propane
Put fire on they ass like little flames
I got this bitch locked down, no chains
And let the people come and get this nigga, no names
6 rings on like MJ, I'ma tense these niggas like sensei
Shit if you ask me, niggas been gay
You wanna get famous nigga say Trae


[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Ok, we started catching felonies in Bankhead
Riding through the hood in a hot box
Its ‘96, n I swear I had a trap house
Every day cut school to sell crack rock
I gotta pistol in the pocket and a bank roll
Anybody try me I'ma let the thang go, bust it
I put a whole clip where ya Kangol, cousin
And Yo Homie don’t like it but he can’t do nothing
Came through busting, And respect that
You violated mandatory nigga, bet that
Walk up, pull out a Smith and Wesson, push ya Wig back
Now the undercover askin people if we did that
They came with the OG’s hanging, OZ’s slanging
Styrofoam, double cup, codeine drinking
You run up on me wrong the .44 be bangin
Meet you at the Crossroad where they don’t be sanging


[Hook - Que]
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hangin' with the killers in the projects
Potato on the barrel keep quiet (shh)
Catch a nigga slippin' from behind (boom)
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!


[Verse 3 - Que]
Hundred bands on your head get the job done
Throw it up throw it up nigga where ya from
Whole hood hot cause ya nigga hittin' licks
Ain't made a mil yet but it's still nigga rich
Stick em up stick em up stick em (stick em up)
How ya want it nigga? Full or the semi
Lurkin' for the cash, searchin' for the bag
Young nigga wildin', throwin' up flags
Shooters on the roof with a scope (boom boom)
Money make em treat ya like the pope (like a king)
Work the block like Dikembe in the post (cook em up)
Nigga hit it with the fork (hit it)


[Hook]
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hangin' with the killers in the projects
Potato on the barrel keep quiet (shh)
Catch a nigga slippin' from behind (boom)
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson!
O.G. Bobby Johnson![Hook]
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do'
Top fell off the drop, crawling on 84's
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low
Five percent of tint, but still my screens gon glow
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick
Everytime, I come round the corner

[Paul Wall]
I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick
But take a trip to South Lea, and end up in a ditch
They got my Purple People Eater once, the next day
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch

[Hook]

[Trae]
When I flip in my slab, I'm fin to beat they back off like I was Lennox
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block
But if one of these haters wanna jack me, slugs gon be flying out the Glock
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking
But not today, cause Trae gon be flipping on top of his game
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me mayn
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Now look how your life stares down a barrel and I swear
I wouldn't let a platinum ghost, jack me in a nightmare
I got that paranoia for you, trigger finger gon' destroy you
And if that trigger finger don't get you, get the number to my lawyer
I hold court with Ben Franklin, I talk with my bread
Soon as I let him out that briefcase, it's off with your head
Can't negotiate with the heat or neither talk to the lead
It'll talk to your head. When it's finished you'll walk with the dead
I call the police they'll probably get him, by the end of the week
I call the streets, they gon get him before the end of the street
With the end of the heat, to set flame to the end of his sweet
The end of his feet, will be poking out the end of a sheet
Hold up I'm just saying though, has this happened before? Naw
But no law, gon' keep these hollows from entering your jaw
If it's my money or my family, or my woman or my car
I'm headed to that blood bank, I'm bout to make a withdrawal

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
When I'm coming round that corner
All you haters, better get up out of my range
Run up on me, if you wanna
I ain't gon play no games, at all when I'm taking my aim
Cause you're gonna be a goner
You thinking of taking mine, late night when the 84's swang
I know you niggas in the game, gotta feel the same
Make a jacker feel the pain, and he can charge it to the game
When I'm coming round that corner
Hmmmm-mmmm-mmmm-mmm-hm-hm-hm
Run up on me, if you wanna
Hmmmm-mmmm-mmmm-mmm-hm-hm-hm
Cause you're gonna be a goner
Hmmmm-mmmm-mmmm-mmm-hm-hm-hm
I know you niggas in the game, gotta feel the same
Make a jacker feel the pain, and he can charge it to the game

[Hook][Hook]
Oh no, there go them Texas boys swanging in a fo' do'
Top still of the drop, but I moved to 24's
Think of taking my slab, haters I don't think so
Cause if you run up on me, I'll be forced to let go
Doing it like a G, and that's all that I'ma show
My trunk done popped up, and I suicided my do's
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers still on my dick
When I'm coming, around they corner

[Paul Wall]
I'm from the City of Syrup, and the land of the fry
Where boys water out they brain, and make they confidence rise
When I wake up in the morning, and the sun in the sky
Another day another chance, to get my piece of the pie
But robbing season come around, whenever the drought kick in
It's guaranteed they coming for me, but I don't know when
I gotta stay up on my note, or I'm paying a cost
Get caught slipping in the turning lane, I'm taking a loss
Boys be plotting on my riches, trying to get what I got
But if you run up on me at the light, you gon get shot
You gotta watch out for these females, cause they out there too
You think they flirting with you, but you really ain't got a clue
Cause boys be stunting in the parking lot, thinking they cool
But when they make out the police report, they feel like a fool
It's Paul Wall I'm in this, for counting stacks
Evading the car jack, but Trae got my back so haters back-back

[Hook]

[Trae]
In a 4-4 I still be swanging in a drop, trying to miss these haters
24/7 like I'm a G, that for cheddar after my paper
Boppers riding me on the daily, like I'm unable to peep out they law
Try to take me up out of my slab, and watch how fast I clear the block out
Diamonds all in my grill, I hit the lot and my slab topless
And I'm something like a profit, when they see the 24's moving stopless
Turning heads on a daily basis, with a trunk that'll beat your back
If you want it come get it, hollow tips and my clip ain't having that
Paul Wall what they talking bout, I've been ready for them hating jackers
They got Trae wrong, I'ma show em the definition of a busting backer
They've been waiting to catch me slipping, they tripping I'm from the gutter
With a semi-automatic, make joning be making em stutter
In Houston we bout that drama, where roaches be on the creep
Everything we ride on be chrome, with at least 20 inches of feet
Oh no, there go them boys and they pulling out in that line
With a nine strapped to they spine, for whatever be going down

[Hook]

[Trae]
I'm trying to shine, everyday on the grind
I'm feeling like it's my time, since haters be out of line
It's time to reload, and put it all in they face
For hopping out of they place, gorillas never been safe
When they bout to explode, everyday on the grind
I'm feeling like it's my time, since haters be out of line
It's time to relooooad, it's time to relooooad

[Hook][Trae]
I pull up on the block, trunk knock the kits off
The fifth fly, but I'm still bout to get pissed off
Swangas on a everyday base, crawl by the law
I don't want another case, with the nigga named Grace
So we put it in they face, with the black drop
Low in the front, cocked up with the top up
Might as well hit the block up, 'fore the drop lock up
With a Glock cocked up, when a hater pop up
I put the rock up, and shine they asses off
Like Roy Pat, I'm coming out the South
Got diamonds in my mouth, when I'm on my route
Throwback screwed up, know what I'm tal'n bout
Hey, niggas say that they don't know about a G
But I bet they know a G, when I pull up on the D
U-B for the S.U.C., S-L-A-B
T-R-A-E, M double A B
I'm sick with it, niggas never get with it
Brick and a mic, guaranteed I'm the shit with it
Better write hard, 'fore you try to come and spit with it
If not, be the next nigga that'll quit with it
A to the B to the N, attitude not a friend
Niggas wanna try to blend, but they better think again
'Fore I put em in the wind, with a pad and a pen
God damn, Lil' Trae going at it for the win

[Boss]
You ain't never seen, Lil' Boss floss in the name
Lil' Boss, trying to get a bigger vault and some change
Stay G, cause playas get lost in the game
Niggas try, to throw a little salt in your name
If I get the word nigga, then I'm off in you mayn
Have your partnas, trying to get my niggas off of you mayn
Never had to call a nigga, cause it's off to the van
To the six foot ziplock, and off to the sand
The dope fiends'll get ya, if I offer a grand
Just to see up on the corner, with the soft in my hand
To the kitchen it get hard, then it's off with the grams
Throwed with my hooks, you soft with your hands
I know you niggas seen us, looking awesome
In Austin cocked up, in a old school steady stalking
All my niggas steady Cripping, some falking
My Blood niggas on the right side, steady balking

[Hook: Shyna]
We Slow, SLow Loud And Bangin how we roll
Pop trunk, blow skunk throwed

Come with the plex, y'all better go
We push y'all head down, to the flo'
Yo, fo's

[Grace]
Southside G's spin 24's, candy Cadillac on 84's
Top fall down and the trunk raise up, fifty side motherfucker that's how we roll
Raising hell at the detail spraying bams, trunk down chopped up on this Screw we jam
Turn it up let it bang as I grip on grain, S.U.C. we off the chain
Fo' do' Magnum when I roll with Trae, Ro and Den in a 3 Los on his way
Expo chopping blue candy knocking, Southside G's and ain't no stopping
Cause the rims keep going me and Trae keep flowing, doe keep blowing codeine po'ing
Oh yeah motherfucker know the South still holding, H-Town shining showing glowing
VS-1's in my neck and in my mouth, white gold blue diamonds know I'm talking bout
Cake runner after cash execute go live, one hundred to the end baby that's no doubt
Real till I die that's how that go, bout to get rolled with sto's a hoe
Play pussy get fucked they'll never know, body burnt toe tagged on a cold trip road
Let it bang and swang candy paint and screens, falling down from the roof we fresh and clean
Southwest side of Houston we got that green, keep a white cup full of that lean
Dirty South we clowning cuz, endo dro blowing killer buzz
On the seat technician punking jugs, going hard than a bitch you gotta feel that cuz

[Trae]
Fucked niggas, really be about now-a-days
All out they do', running they mouth the fly way
But I know one thang, they don't wanna try Trae
Have em like Po-Yo and Paul, sitting sideways in a daze
I'm a representative, for the South
Never too good, so they know I'm paying niggas off
Like a new set of fo's, I be wearing niggas off
Elbows poking out, so I'm clearing niggas off
Slow Loud And Bangin, like Jay and Boss
And you can tell I'm out that click, from the way I floss
The black whip brand new, but it still get tossed
I thought the top was a test, for that chick I lost
I'm on a flip through the Nawf, riding through the 4-4
See the homie Lil' Chris, Shep with the Vato
If it gotta get G, just know we got mo'
16 come fast, but the paint go slow
These hoes don't know, that I'm raw in the game
Raw on the block, still on Fondren and Main
Got 99 ways, that I'm grabbing the grain
For the 2-5, gotta keep my mouth in a maze
And now-a-days, niggas say I'm lost in the game
These cats gon see, I'm a boss in the game
And I pack my weight, never soft in the game
Old G.P., I'ma be a hog in the game

[Hook]

[Shyna]
S-L-A-B, B-E see we
Slow Loud And Bangin, that's that C-L-I-C
K we spray on block on anyday, if your block got boys and shit
We play games on all of y'all, who wanna be talking shit
We in that kitchen cooking, watch out them po-po's looking
Get that do' slap a hoe, let em know his block is tooken
Throwed, in H-Town we riding slow
Slow (slow), we slow (slow)

[Paul Wall]
Grab the keys start the slab, chunk the deuce get some dab
Swang the block cut the corner, hand on Glock mind on cash
Chasing after the American dream, all or nothing trying to stack that green
Nothing to lose if you ain't down with us, don't straddle the fence you on the wrong team
Grab a white cup and po' up the drank, so much mud I can hardly think
In a line riding slab by slab, ain't nothing but chrome and that platinum paint
It's Paul Wall and my partna Trae, Jay'Ton and that boy Lil' Boss
Keep your cool and don't cross the line, or it's guaranteed that you'll get fucked off

[Kendro]
Jamming A.B.N., so you know I ride slab
Back in the gap, I was crawling the AVE
I don't slow my pace, but give a nigga some dab
I'm deuce out the roof, when I be flipping the loop
At 59, then bend the corner on some knot
And the Trae on Blodge, and laws they hot
Bro, I go tip through the Mo
Fuck with Shep Dog, out the 4-4
Pop your trunk, T-R-A-E
We still body rock, for P-A-T

I'm Slow Loud And Bangin, on a paper route
A lot of these cats, they envy me
I'm hellified, cool on G.P
Rap shit locked, it's in a figga fo'
Name another young cat, that's thoed as Kendro[Intro: Baby Houston & Trae tha Truth]
Daddy, I wanna ride in that old school today
You wanna ride in that old school, what you wanna ride in that fo'?
I'm tryna get this money, man
Oh, yeah? What you know about getting money?
See you're gonna be a problem just like your older brother, fool
I ain't mad at you though, sun is hot, huh?
Guess I might as well shine on a few today
Aight man, come on!
Where my keys at?

[Verse 1: Trae]
I gotta hit this corner homie
Real anticipation
Shit i was getting money
A couple nigga hating
A couple bitches waiting too
Tell them to pick a number
Look like laguna,kinda hard to keep them getting under
I'm in my old school,swingin like i'm stevie wonder
They say my wrist don't make sense ,i call them dumb and dumber
I track your feel through half these women call me trae the runner
I keep a shooter riding with that oklahoma thunder
When he done he switch up cities like if he james harding
You about that wood? i like to beg your motherfucking pardon
You better find someone to play with
I'm in my old school coolin nigga
Better not say shit

[Hook 1: Trae tha Truth]
Hit the block homie,shine on them like lights
Let the ceiling take flight (in my old school)
Beat the trunk on them
Let the 4's poke out so fuck niggas be about (in my old school)
A couple women with with me, ain't hard to see what they about
So much ass they can't get out (in my old school)
It ain't no point of flexing
I grab my 6 and money until my hustle run out
(in my old school)


[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Keep more wood than a cabin
Nigga what really happen?
Paint hard as fuck,leather soft as a napkin
Yeah the truth leaning corners like it's purple rain
I'm moving slow with somthing floating on them purple planes
Body thick as hell,picture in the perfect frame
Lord knows i only seen her ass,i never heard her name
The black stayed up,terrific king like the national champ
Real nigga exercizing till i catch a cramp
Slow loud and banging when i'm itching the other chick to stand
Fore i pull my rank and send the word to rearrange the camp
Im in my old school,this whip cold fool
Earthquake,i have it beatin through your soul fool

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2: Snoop Dogg]
Brown cadillac,white chevrolet
All day every day (in my old school)
Candy paint dripping,man i ain't ever slipping
Yeah i'm 20 cripping (in my old school)
I keep my music loud
As i move the crowd
With the windows down
Banging that motown
Blowing the dogg pound
They tell me "slow down"
(In my old school)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Times wasting ,i'm going to go get it
Drop the top,lifting out cities
Squat it, got it, feeling good
Rolling around my neighborhood
Bossing up,tossing up cash
Glass house ,ass drag
Go to the store and get me one more
Low riders, three or four
Cali chronic is all that we blow
Trae the truth right from the intro
So when you get down to your last few dollars
Really wanna sell it but you don't wanna holler
Laid laid back back
Lean lean to the side
AC blowing,now you know it
How we rolling on the west side

Get gone kid, before I get in that zone kid
Stop all that damn begging, and go on get your own kid
You know you wrong dog, just cause I'm on dog
Think everytime you stick your hand out, like I'm suppose to give you what ya want dog
That shit done ran out, when I was doing time you clowns ran out
Now you wan' keep eating off mine, that shit don't pan out
They bout to cut your lights off, you tell me that shit ery' month
That's just what Loc talking bout, this time dog ain't the one
Ery'time a nigga fell, you'd be right there to catch him
But the one time you deny him, now that clown mad at ya
Look fuck that, take it how you wanna
Better get you a sign, and stand ya ass on the corner
Get off ya ass people, and go on get your hustle on
We all created equal, stop singing all them sad songs
So all you dead beats, won't you please stop calling me
Begging for cheese, but man that ain't what ya need look thug

[Hook: Shyna]
We don't owe you fuck you, go get it on your own
Everyday I've been grinding getting it all alone, without you
We don't owe you fuck you, go get it on your own
Everyday I've been grinding gettting it all alone, I don't need you

[Trae]
It seems I can't understand, why the fuck my people trip with me like I owe em some'ing
Get off your ass don't look to me for handouts, cause I can't give you nothing
Plus I heard niggas got a lot to say, about how I live my life
Get this right the reason that I ride alone, is cause half of you niggas ain't right
Shife maybe just a tad bit, see I can only call what I see
To each it's own do what you do, but the fact remains I'm still a G
Who I be it really don't matter dog, but just know I'm still the same
I grind full time, while you niggas don't squab a heavyweight in this game
I was told you gotta get up and get it, depending on what you want not what you need
We all need a lot of thangs, but say dog can you succeed
Only time'll tell inside this life, while some of us left alone
And I ain't mad at all I'm a better man, when I get shit on my own

[Hook]

[Trae]
I was taught, that you gotta be your own man
But everybody that I know, holding out they hand
Looking at me, like I owe they ass something
Stressing me everyday, wasn't  part of the plan - 2x

[C-Loc]
Why they whining, I just do what I do
Please don't waste my time, get off your ass and get you
Look why you trying to count mine, you need to focus on you
I'm out here trying to survive nigga, just like you
They searching for a free ride, that's what a lot of em do
But they ain't nowhere to be found, when you be needing them fools
Look they don't play by the rules, like they ain't even got a clue
So it's best that you keep moving, cause Loc ain't got nothing for you

[Hook]

(*Shyna*)
Don't need you, I don't need you
I've been doing it, this long
I've been doing it, on my own
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you[Hook]

Yea that rate I’m gonna get my respect

You don’t get it from the hands you get it from the tip
Guaranteed I’m a win place your bet
If you wait for the trap pound for pound
Pull the slab out the shop you bound to drown
When the club raised up i’m bound to clown
Put a price on your head and calm you down
Praise me in the streets and I’ll save you nigga
It doesn't matter if it's trae they phaze you nigga
Think you better than the truth they played you nigga
Get your money up forget it I raised you nigga
I’m in the zone you can hear it all in my voice
I’m the king of the street you got no choice

Niggas pussy I don’t like you
Keep it rockin might just ignite you
King cobra might just bite you
Infrared might just sight you
Spend my whole life trying to make a
Hundred grand on a slow night
Afterwards you can tell them i’m low life
Squeeze up to the silver life
I hear a bunch of niggas try
But they wouldn't be
You want to get up in the game I’m an OG
I’m a play to the end nigga OT
You want to tip me nigga and you don’t know me
You can talk or you don’t want to talk back
Walk your ass over here and you don’t walk back
Nigga I was on a roll pull up at your house like like like
Pull up at your house nigga where your hoes at
Got a team and a wrist nigga frooze that
Fuck niggas want to hate I suppose that
Top up my shit can’t close that
Neco get the stick don’t know that
It’s a bunch of shit that I don’t feel getting real
Fuck these haters now I work my way up
Seventeen on my k and put it all in my grill
And now young og gonna tell

New Trae Tha Truth album coming soon
It's The Blackprint nigga, streets on fire
DJ Scream hurry Chim and Chi
Salute and I'm signing out[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Sitting in hell's den watching murder like a show on
Shot em in cold blood like he was beefing with the snow on
He ain't really deserve it but that's life and that must go on
Praying we get it right, knowing some how that we gon' go wrong
It ain't no point of being real when everybody joking
Niggas hit the corner with cheese, now everybody smoking
Probably to numb away the pain from a deeper wound
Sick of singing blue so they move into a deeper tune
15 for the stripes, he ain't fighting shit
He bout that fireworks, self-employed how he lighting shit
Realizing if he get caught he gon' be [?] shit
Pussy told the DEA, fuck a statement, he ain't writing shit
Blood nigga nuts hanging like elephantitis
Devil forgot the key, [?] Becky just waiting to ignite us
It's all the same, tell em where I'm from it's messed up
Where niggas lose their life for disrespect, niggas so messed up

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I say he used to be the man, now he's begging for a grand
$2 ass nigga can't lend a helping hand
Yeah he used to be good, he had to work for that jug
He turned his back on his niggas and went and state on the hood
That statement can't take back, regret that he made that
Sat down and trial and error, recorded tape, they played that
No icontact now, but I used to look up to him
I used to wanna be just like him, now I just spite him
Snitching ain't condoned, even to my closest kin
Yeah I'm getting money now and I was getting money then
Just still popping off, ain't nothing boring the hood
Sin city money man I'm whipping forms thrugh the hood
Times done changed, BG's now OG's
Used to be 25, damn near 40 for the ki
Better outlook at life, better know how to cook the white
Soft to the hard, hard niggas turn to soft

[Verse 3: J. Stalin]
My lil nigga lost his twin and I know he hurt
Tossed a dark cloud over the whole west
Packers wouldn't even let him out to go and pay respect
Last month I seen a good nigga get put to rest
Tryna do my best to hold back the tears
Cause if you living up in Oakand, you living in fear
Nigga we break the homicide record every year
I don't know what you looking for but love don't live here
It's crack babies selling crack around here
Them lil niggas is strapped so hear me loud and clear
Ain't nothing but dope fiends, bums and red rum
You ain't got a gun, better run when them niggas come
Swear to God I wake up every morning, get to see the sun
My niggas is dying, wasting money by the ton
I'm tryna smoke away the pain but I'm killing my lungs
My brother gone, now it's on me to teach his son

Pimping these hoes
Nothing but a G, is all I expose
I've been pimping since, been pimping since, been pimping since
Been pimping since, been pimping these hoes
Pimping these hoes
Nothing but a G, is all I expose
I've been pimping since, been pimping since, been pimping chicks
They got no sense, I'm pimping these hoes

[Trae]
A P-I-M-P. is all I modify
And niggas wanna try, but they don't even qualify
To even get close, to a nigga named Trae
When I pull out the drop, trunk pop and wave
These hoes be bopping, when my screens lit
I fly right by, so they don't even benefit
To get close to me, or S.L.A.B
We threw up the deuce, so keep beating your feet
My game be out of reach, unseen and unheard
I wreck so many flows, I'm classified as terd
Shit, who you think showed y'all the game
Definition of a guerilla, that's untamed
Swanging in fo' lanes, when I'm on the cell phone
With a dark brown dyke, and a bad yellow bone
That's trying to get me home, so they can get it on
They wanna get wrecked, so I'm calling Skinny home
Or maybe even By-Bo, if he pick up his phone
Or maybe even Z-Ro, if he ain't in the zone
You know how we do it, pimping since been pimping still
Pimping never gon be simping, man
They don't wanna see a G shining
Open up my mouth, and these hoes are gonna be blinded
Lining em up, like they on Soul Train
Lil' Trae off the chain, better get my change

[Lil' B]
When I hit the block, bitch better have my money
I'm a P-I-M-P, you think it's funny
All about my dough, like Pooh Bear to honey
I'ma keep my hoes hopping, like a bunny
Get em on stage, and let em work and twerk
Come out they shirt and skirt, and do a little flirt
It don't hurt to come off, a little bit of change
Cause my hoes is bringing, it back to me mayn
When I heat it, it's gon cost a fee I have a thee
We fifteen minutes, or you have to ski
Don't beat your meat, better yet beat your feet
Cause I'm the pimp that's running, these H-Town streets
I'm a pimp by the way I walk, the way I talk
You mad but it ain't my fault, your girl was taught
To work something, and bring it back to me
Lil' B, you fake bustas recognize a G
I'm so thoed when I spit, money, hoes, clothes
It just won't quit, been pimping since been pimping
Was this with million dolla hoes, to make me rich
Dish it's nothing but shrimp, I strut with a limp
Never been a simp, or a whimp
Know the real niggas, is feeling me
Confidentially, a P-I-M-P

[Jay'Ton]
I'm a G from SLAB, pimp in these streets
Stepping out in clothes, that hoes done bought me
Scoping Air Force 1's, hoes that jock me
Jay'Ton the pimp, you don't wanna see
Stepping out the Cadillac, with Kim and Rockell
Can't forget Shay, cause she fine as hell
All a nigga know, is how to make change
So I send em in, and out the hotel
Spreading they legs, and working they mouth
It's an everyday thang, in the Dirty South
In the game I play, I ain't fin to be broke
When I want my mail, they better hit that route
And keep grinding, I want all of my cash
If they don't come pay, then I'm kicking they ass
And sending em back, to the hood where they from
Hit the switch, and burn off on they ass

[Pimp Skinny]
Pimp Skinny, G nigga
Represent, and let the game unfold
Recognize, I done told you hoes
Girl you know, my game is thoed
Nothing but the G shit, from the pros
Give me what's mines, or you got to go
Better peep the game, and go get my dough
And niggas get to tripping, they can get the fo'
Cause I'm a G nigga, till the day I go
And when I hit the do', commits to cuff your hoe
Late night fucking, in the middle the flo'
Until your bitch say, she don't want no mo'
(ooh Pimp skinny), you already know
Been in my blood, since 1-9-7-4
Never ever, will I love a hoe
I just knock em down, and put em out the do'

Still on that grey cassette, pimp all up in my dick
Real nigga, don't disrespect, I take flight like a jet
Swangers look it's stitchers, trunk solved and like this tension
Slam on that other shit, ceiling with no suspension
Ain't no grass I ain't walkin
I'm Tha Truth, wutchu talkin?
Keep me a foreign bitch, with something pink like a dolphin
Everything heavy coated, Porsche moving like a stallion

Rolling and restless, somewhere off in the city
Thuggin into my casket, haters ain't fuckin with me

Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learning right from wrong
They say my-me for the outcome, ban my records
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a-me for the outcome, ban my records
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck living blinded

[Verse 1:]
My last year was the worst but my life goes on
I been balance most of my life I feel like something is wrong
I know this goin be okay soon as I weather this storm
And make a call up there of God I hope he answer his phone
They say my music for the less fortunate people in the bad place
What about all the victims and children with a sad case
I'm they big homie and I won't turn my back for none of y'all
Ever try to hurt or maybe hell on everyone of y'all
Maybe that's why they out here banning my records
Check it, ain't gotta like tha Truth but please respect it
I'm on that Pac shit, even if I fall I try to do my best
Tell em I was focus on the slumps I couldn't see the rest
Within the process I seen alot wishing me harm
Knowing the truth need the only thang keeping me calm
And even know I know that hateful shit ain't bad to me
I had to make myself a sacrifice so people can see

[Hook: samples "Krazy" by 2Pac]
Last year was a hard one, but life goes on (life goes on)
Hold my head against the wall learning right from wrong (learning right from wrong)
They say my-me for the outcome, ban my records (they ban my records)
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it (homie please respect it)
I took a-me for the outcome, ban my records (they ban my records)
Check it, don't have to bump this but please respect it (homie please respect it)
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us (cheeah)
Turned into a plus, now they stuck living blinded

[Verse 2:]
All this time in the drain got me losing my cool
Instead of teaming with the fake I choose to move with this tool
I keep it for my protection knowing nothing is real
So either streets or with this rapping they got something to feel
All I did was gave my life to em for what it is nothing else
I shall they knew that wouldn't understand knowing they something else
They try to count me out, take away from me and mine
Yeah the road is low but I know one thang I'm goin be a shine
If God is my shield no weapon shall prosper the solider
I am the truth and you can bred it was there if I told ya
I'm standing strong I ain't goin be the one they pushing over
I'm frowning now but I'll be smiling for they say it's over
It's me against the world homie that's no lie
Sunny days never chill they only roll by
They want my thoughts so I'm a load up and give it to em
I stamp it box it up and then send it too em

Yeah, they finna have a problem on this one mayn
H-Town representing, Screwed Up Click
You in here, with Trae the Truth mayn
I had to take em back, on this one
We gon throw this back for P-A-T, and DJ Screw
Mafio and Gator, it's finna go down round here
You know we just getting started, Asshole By Nature

[Trae]
They know I'm here to bring it gangsta, when I'm sitting on something glass
I'm original Screwed Up Click, I don't believe in moving fast
Catch me tipping on fo' 4's, with my trunk open and close
Them haters gon kill theyself, when I pull up in suicide do's
400 dollar loc's on my face, with diamonds in my mouth
And I'm well acquainted with Johnny, bitch I'm shining in the South
No need to watch out for jackers, say homie I'm to the good
Not only because I'm strapped, but I kept it real with the hood
So it's understood, when I pull out that block in the line
You see me rolling, with the top down
Thinking how I just got paid, pop trunk wave
Like I'm fresh out of Jack, in a drop that got sprayed

[Hook: Fat Pat - 4x]
Just-just, got paid
Pop-pop, trunk wave

[Trae]
It ain't no explaining off top, Trae fin to shine on em
If you ain't holding, move out the way while I recline on em
I tend to get reckless, whenever my trunk get to rocking
I rearrange the neighborhood, when I'm pulling up knocking
I know these haters watching, but they bet not cross the line
D-Boy two cars behind, fin to put something across your mind
We might just swang em down, and show em how we rep in Tex'
A '94 version of Pat, now who the next to plex
They ain't gon like it, when they get a taste of A.B.N
Bubble lights, alligator insides yeah they gon hate me then
And I'm the truth, if you don't like it come and see me homie
And if you doubt it, I can make you where you believe me homie

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
In a wide body, and I'm sitting so thoed
Fresh set of glass, so I'm hogging up the road
Diamonds on the wood, definition of gripping grain
So I threw in a throwback Screw, and let that motherfucker bang
I'm in a zone I boss when I floss, riding for the set
And this paint that you see on this whip, is classified as wet
And I bet that you gon respect it, 'fore it damage ya mayn
Cause running off at the mouth, will get your car ran dead out the lane
And that's the bidness mayn, better respect a G 'fore he click
And I dropped the top the same time, I dropped the kit
And for the hate, I still swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk, yep-yep-yep-yeeep

[Hook - 16x][Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
In first class, presidential
Money flyin' like Continental
Kill them niggas, no accidentals
They feelings hurt like they was sentimental
All I see is these hoes flexin'
I turn 'em up 'til these hoes 'plexin'
I should've known I couldn't come to chill
These broke hoes crowd my whole section
'Hood jumpin' like nothing's stoppin'
They spend the shit if ain't nothin' poppin'
I don't like no bitch that be boppin'
Can't fuck with me 'less you rockin'
Your clothes cool, but they droppin'
Your friend cool, but she blockin'
They low as Hell when I go off
Let money fight like we boxin'

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Strip clubs and dollar bills
Still got more money
Patron shots, can I get a refill?
Still got more money
Strippers goin' up and down that pole
And I still got more money
Four o'clock and we ain't going home
Cause I still got more money
Money make the world go 'round
I still got more money
Bands make your girl go down
Still got more money
A lot more where that came from
Still got more money
The look in your eyes, I know you want some
Still got more money

[Hook: Rihanna]
Oh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Oh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Valet cost a hundred bill
Still got more money
Gold all up in my grill
Still got more money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got more money
Call Jay up and close a deal
Still got more money
My fragrance on, and they love my smell
Still got more money
So who cares about what I spend?
Still got more money
My pockets deep, and they never end
Still got more money
I'm goin' dumb with all my friends
Still got more money

[Hook: Rihanna][Hook: Z-Ro]
Too many problems on my mind
Living shife is starting to be a full time grind
I'm just trying to live my life
But somehow peace is something I'll never find
Too many problems on my mind
Living shife is starting to be a full time grind
I'm not trying to lose my life
But if I do, I wanna' meet Jesus Christ

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I never thought that I would have to be back like this
But my pain never let me get away
I don't wanna' be up under the grave
But every time I turn around
There ain't another nigga safe where I stay
I know I can't get around it, cause it's a part of life
And everybody got to go sometimes
80% of my niggas dead, the other 10 locked
The last 10, around here crying
Lord I feel like this can't be fair to a nigga
But I know that I got to make due
Too many situations will put a brick wall up on a nigga
But either way I got to make it through
I know a lot of shit come my way, but it's ok
I know it probably could've been a lot worse
I ain't dead, I ain't in a hearse
But still I got to deal with the fact that a nigga feeling curse
I need to let it out, so I spit it in a verse
And it ain't too safe, but it's stuck in my chest
Now a days, I don't even wanna' answer my cell phone
Cause that's bad news at it's best
Fuck rest, I never ever seen peace
Unless it was a piece that I was packing on the block
Hard times ain't too far, that's why I stay strapped
And pray to God so that he can make it stop
Shife ain't the way that a nigga wanna be
But circumstance can get a nigga put up in a cross
I don't wanna' take another loss
But a nigga stress got me looking teary eyed when I floss
Death ain't never been a friend of mine in my life
And I bet that nigga know my name
I've been fighting with his ass for 24 years
And with the way shit look, ain't nothing gon' change

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I got my phone call the day my nigga done got hit with a bid
Probably for the things that he did
I don't wanna' see my nigga doing time
And he said I was all that he had, with his wife and his kids
How the fuck am I supposed to deal with that?
Plus my nigga never did nothing wrong
Now I gotta know my nigga locked up in a steel cage
With a thought that he never coming home
I don't wanna' feel certain shit, but I know that I got to
I never knew why I got to run to a nigga
All I ever wanted was a piece of mine
Plus I got fate but I feel like it ain't coming to a nigga
Every other day, my little boy sick
But I'm getting strong every time I see him smile
I don't give a fuck what them folks telling me bout Nick
They can never understand my child, plus Little Gerald ain't mine
But I promised to God for them two, I'll put it on the line
They the only ones left that remind me of me
Long as they live, I give a fuck if I'm dying
I remember, back when Nicky got that time
My nigga Ship helped me to maintain
To put up my fucking nigga who lost his T-Jones
I know it's only right for me to go and do the same
I gotcha', I ain't finna' let nothing happen to ya' my nigga
Just know that ya' gotta stay strong
Look at all the bullshit I go through
Probably only one-eight off it make it to a song
Something, I put up then I go into a zone
With a attitude niggas better leave me alone
Ain't too many other ways a nigga understand
Unless this man put a hot slug in his dome

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae The Truth]
Motherfuckers never understand why I feel like I do
Until they start to get it like I do
Everybody now a days, think they can take it like I do
But never see the shit I go through, I been a grown man
How the fuck am I supposed to cope
Watching my nigga laying stretched out
Shit be so close, I don't know who gonna' be next to go
That's why guerrilla stay stressed out
I don't wanna' do time in a pen for me killing a nigga
But I ain't finna' let 'em broke me off
Plus Dickey taught me not to ever let a nigga get close
So they can never get to fuck me off
My nigga we do it Ag-town in the street it fucking me up
Cause they fam with the wrath of Trae
And every time I spit it out for the hood
I be repping the squad, and let 'em know that I be blue over grey
I ain't been around much, but I swore my niggas on my mind
And I don't wanna' be by myself
And I don't know who to trust when I hit the block by myself
So I proceed to be by myself, and every time I get sad
I'm in the zone all by myself and so I gotta' roll by myself
And I don't need no friend no bitch, so I find myself
I'm in the class all by myself, I'm on they ass all by myself
Stress run at me like a relay
Plus I never get to win, I really don't wanna' sin
But I know if I want to survive and lead back to the dividends
I hope God get to hear a nigga cry, as time goes by
And I can finally get to ease my mind
But for now I gotta' deal with the life that I don't wanna' deal
And hope everything'll be fine

[Hook][Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Fuck all the niggas that doubted me
I tell all these niggas I love m, only thing I care if my mama is proud of me
Whatever you want, I sware I don't give a fuck, I ain't goin lie to you
Just don't lie to me
These niggas know I'm with Truth, there's nothin they can do, they know I'm a protigy

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I don't give a fuck, tell them haters to quote it
Catchin plays, tell m, bases are loaded
Hit the plug, tell him go head and load it
If he can't make the plan, tell him boat it
I just get the money, never promote it
Presidential, like these niggas done voted
Pull up on you, nigga, shoot till the chopper empty, reload it
Pussy nigga, stay up in your place
Re-up niggas, let us have a toast
Women beggin me to keep m close
I just send m back for the night, I hope
Guess that how to play, ghost
Diamonds on my neck, wetter than the coast
I'm the truth, like I'm up in the post
I'm sellin what other niggas do the most

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Fuck all the niggas that doubted me
I tell all these niggas I love m, only thing I care if my mama is proud of me
Whatever you want, I sware I don't give a fuck, I ain't goin lie to you
Just don't lie to me
These niggas know I'm with Truth, there's nothin they can do, they know I'm a protigy

[Verse 2: Sy Ari Da Kid]
They don't understand, I blast your mama
I should go fuck, gotta race to the tunnel
All on at eight, come straight from the jungle
No time, I come straight out to huddle
Nigga, know I switch pay like the auto
Thought I want, I got all this water
I don't even need to stay with your daughter
Don't believe what people say in them articles
I got my niggas
I got my niggas, and they got me too
They know I got them bitches
And they got the liquor and we got the switches
And I know some killers
But I really don't them motherfuckers killing, I want them motherfuckers living
I'm the realeest, ain't nobody realer

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Fuck all the niggas that doubted me
I tell all these niggas I love m, only thing I care if my mama is proud of me
Whatever you want, I sware I don't give a fuck, I ain't goin lie to you
Just don't lie to me
These niggas know I'm with Truth, there's nothin they can do, they know I'm a protigy

        [Chorus: Trae Tha Truth]
All my niggas down to ride
You ain't bout it, nigga, you done lie
I'm cold, every time I slide
Couple niggas, chopper up inside
I get money, nothin here is free
Nothin fake, real is what you see
Yeah, you hard, but you can't fuck with me
Now pull up, pull up

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I hear haters thinkin something sweet
Pull up, this chopper take him off his feet
You ain't talkin money, ain't no point of speakin
Bitch, I'm about that action, all you do is cheap
Ain't no other standing, fuck a conversation
I'm king, respected across the nation
Pull up on a nigga, run up like we racing
I don't catch a charge, be like a home invasion
I fill up a nigga, like four cups
Asshole by nature, give no fucks
I kill a nigga dead, no toetrucks
It's me, nigga, don't look tough
Don't take much to catch a body, fuck the Mozerati
Stole it, pull up like a jocky
Grab the Drako, beam him up like he's Scotty
Take care of you, beat him up, like we was Rocky

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth]
All my niggas down to ride
You ain't bout it, nigga, you done lie
I'm cold, every time I slide
Couple niggas, chopper up inside
I get money, nothin here is free
Nothin fake, real is what you see
Yeah, you hard, but you can't fuck with me
Now pull up, pull up

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
A Lee parked, do ten with Mertin
Young nigga strapped up, leavin bodies dirty
Funny ass nigga, na, we don't joke around a lot
One phone call, have them killers at your mama spot
Camped outside, like them new Jordans coming out
Bars, na, nigga, you gotta show me what you talkin bout
Tarzan nigga, we don't squobble, we can shoot it out
Now they wanna squosh beef, that's that shit I'm talkin bout
Tats on your face, nigga, don't feel it
Real street niggas go tattoo less
Fre Lil Jordan, bro doin fifty years
It's drank city, bitch, we don't sip beer
Hundred rocket missiles in case a nigga got ears
Poppin at your temple, it don't matter where it hit you
Hit m with the money, lil homies come and get you
Fuckin with me, all them niggas with me official

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth]
All my niggas down to ride
You ain't bout it, nigga, you done lie
I'm cold, every time I slide
Couple niggas, chopper up inside
I get money, nothin here is free
Nothin fake, real is what you see
Yeah, you hard, but you can't fuck with me
Now pull up, pull up

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Set the wave, let a nigga slip
Bustin out the band, do it just like TIP
Long ass gun barol, if a nigga try to trip
Let a fuck nigga get his whole sinked ship
Ride through the hood, Truth lookin like a mennis
If I catch you talkin shit, make you lookin like a dentist
Doin bidniss with me, I let you know when it's finished
Imma take his ass to the terf, like a scrimmage
King of the streets, when they speakin my name
I feel like the sea, bitch, I'm makin it rain
Pull up, facts, I set it right through your frame
Don't make m like me, so we are not the same
No matter the color, they know who it is
Got that K with me, like I run with Wiz
Have them niggas come through with me, like we runnin the biz
Bidness with TIP, then he go back to handlin his

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth]
All my niggas down to ride
You ain't bout it, nigga, you done lie
I'm cold, every time I slide
Couple niggas, chopper up inside
I get money, nothin here is free
Nothin fake, real is what you see
Yeah, you hard, but you can't fuck with me
Now pull up, pull up(*talking*)
I got you baby, put your seatbelt on mayn
It's finna be a serious ride, a nigga finna take you know
There's a chance, a nigga might not even make it back
One thang I know fa sho, I'm going down in history for this one
Trae the motherfucking Truth, I'm pushing this bitch
Asshole By Nature

[Trae]
Now they hear everything out here be fucked up, I know I gotta watch what I say
I got a few niggas still stuck on lockdown, hoping they might come home one day
So I gotta do my best to do what I do, and try to get all the way to the top
Whether I fall or drop shit don't stop, so I refuse to lose what I got
I'ma push my shit like I push a black whip, and homie don't trip I'll be right back
Even if it get rough I'm a G, it'll be ok real niggas know how to bounce back
Right here for the realest I gotta keep up, ain't nan nigga out here finna see Trae
With the heat I got and the conversation with the mack, gon get niggas up out the way
I done been at the bottom too long it seem to me, they wanna see me ass'd the fuck out
But I tell em don't hold they breath waiting on me to lose, they ass'll pass the fuck out
Trae is the Truth out here you can tell when I spit, niggas know what it do out here
Determination on my chest got me in that other shit, so nigga you will get ran through out here
Don't call my bluff I'd rather see you make it, ain't no need to be fucked off
It's too many real niggas dead, while the scary ass niggas out here stay ducked off
These niggas out here be real fraud, they fuck around and get real scarred
And I'm doing 8-5 on the dash, when I'm in my whip I flip real hard

[Hook - 4x]
(push), I'm pushing mayn
(push), I'm pushing mayn
(push), I'm pushing mayn
(push), push it to the limit

[Trae]
I got a few G's out here who still need help, so I gotta get em out of this trap
Every chance that I get I'ma try to get em paid, when I get a little money coming back from the rap
And I got lil' niggas coming up still gangbanging, so I know a nigga still gotta fight
And I gotta do my best to show em this life, so they will last show em what's wrong and what's right
But they got me the voice of the streets, and I hear a few niggas wanna get a nigga crown
I done been in this bitch a decade, it take a lil' mo' than a lot if you wanna see Trae get down
I done been around with the old heads on the block, in the back of the trap with a brick and a Glock
In the middle of the night till the sunlight pop, then they off in the night with they top on drop
To keep from the cops that's how a nigga earn, watch em fuck up that's how a nigga learn
Got sent to the back now they know it's my turn, fuck over Trae your ass'll get burned
I've never been weak I keep shit stern, ain't no folks ever been my concern
I laid down the law you can call me the firm, fake sideways talk get straight like perm
I do everything that I do for the streets, and it been about them never been about me
T-E to the X-A-S O.G., niggas saying I quit they don't know about me
I'ma push this shit for my lil' brother Jay, my big brother Dinkie and Joe McVey
For my nigga Shot G, Lil' Ro, DJ, I'ma push this shit clean up out the way

[Hook - 4x]

All that barking that you doing, I don't trust you
And on the cool you got a nigga saying fuck you, fuck you

Let me tell you what the bidness is, ain't no room for games to be played
I only got love for my money, cause that's what's keeping me paid
See you ain't on the mission I'm on, your attitude show it all
You out here for yourself, and that I'm really not feeling at all
I've been wise since I was young, that's why I made it this far
And I be damned if you around me, just to feel like a star
I'd rather do my thang, maintain while I stay on the grind
And I'm a gangsta baby, I don't need nobody around huh

Nigga, I ain't even trynna hold back[Hook: Dej Loaf]
I remember when I get my knees like every night, every night
[?] problem I had every day, every day
I know I ain't crazy, I got my mind
I know what I believe, nigga I'm a G
So, real is my religion
Stay silent with my niggas, never put 'em under bitches
Now real is my religion
Getting money, handle business
Real is my religion

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I thank god for waking me up today
Nothin' about it promised, I'll live it till its taken away
It might happen quicker for the ones who can't make it away so regardless let me pray
Way too many out aimin' for Trae
Even those I love
But I won't kick it how they kick it, they too different n im something solid
D-Kee? raised me to be stiff, them niggas too fly in need of a pilot
If they ain't trippin over money, they out here trippin out over hoes
I never put any of that before my people, even tho they heart was froze, Hate was chose
I used to be 1000
Now im tryin to multiply it twice
Loyalty is mandatory, never switch it for a price
Niggas snakes in broad day, no hidin', they can walk now
I just judge em by they actions
They all confusion when they talk now

I am not crazy, if I do it  know its for a reason
Shit if I speak it, then respect it, this is real nigga season
At least for me
I'm trying to bring it back around
I know I owe that fo the ones that ain't around...

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
The devil thinkin bout ways he can work ya, they say that hatin can hurt ya
You thinkin its love but homie waitin on a day he can merc ya
Jealousy and Envy nothin healthy, dont let it convert ya
Find yourself in hell alone
Where no one can save ya or church ya
Moving back in time thinkin about what could be
I'm doin this shit i do for him, this shit ain't nothin to me
Off in these streets, im that gospel- Pay attention
I can show you what was real and what was not- just pay attention
The way I live my life, they lookin at me like im a crime
Is it because I speak the truth and everyone of em lyin?
Look even closer, a better flaw in me you ain't gon find
Bein real is my religion until they bury me somewhere within the ground
But for now im out here hustlin
Watchin me, what they must have been
Tryna crucify me the same time these niggas were rushin in
Some people was family but didn't handle me like we was kin
I told em once they leave up out my presence they best not come again...

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
I remember when I get my knees like every night, every night
[?] problem I had every day, every day
I know I ain't crazy, I got my mind
I know what I believe, nigga I'm a G
So, real is my religion
Stay silent with my niggas, never put 'em under bitches
Now real is my religion
Getting money, handle business
Real is my religion[Trae]
Yeah, real talk for my niggas on the block
I been wrecking for a second, but I promised that I wouldn't stop
I been in it with my niggas, for a long time
But they gotta give it to me, cause they know I wouldn't drop
Same nigga, with the flow
Same nigga that'll spin a nigga's ass up, throw his ass in the trunk
I'm a representative, for the Assholes
Try to run up on me, I'll teach a nigga how to stunt
Southwest, you better get your hands up
'Fore I send a wave of niggas, that'll hit your man's up
While you wanna-be thugs, better pull your pants up
Then the shit, hit the fan
Then I fuck, your fans up
These niggas, really got a nigga fucked up
Hating motherfuckers, I'll show you what the beef is
Show you niggas how to lose teeth, keep running off at the mouth
And I can show you niggas, what the sleep is
Better give it up, when you hear the name Trae
When I hit the block in black, your ass better pray
Tell the five in the hood, I don't play
And I got more niggas, in the slugs
In the tip, of a K
And I run with the C's, and the B's on the block
And the G's, and few B.D.'s on the block
And I kept it real, so I got the keys to the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the blockI'll put it on the pack, and I'll ride for it first
Nigga jump, gonna be the first nigga that'll slide for it
They don't wanna see me in a zone, when I try for it
Any real nigga, stand up and get an eye for it
Cause I'm oh so real, though homie
And I'm next in the line, finna show the world what it was
H-Town, till the death
Intuition of a nigga named Pac, finna let it rain for the thugs

[Trae]
Somebody better give me the crown, these niggas out of line
And I see, I gotta put 'em in they place
Everyday it be the same old shit, I gotta click on a bitch
I don't really, wanna pay another case
Whey they niggas wanna try a nigga, like a nigga soft than a bitch
I'll lean on a nigga, like Boss on a switch
Better chill, 'fore I get to going off on a bitch
Lace the Nike's, and break a nigga jaw in this bitch
Everybody, wanna know about the South
But I promise, you niggas'll wanna take another route
A.B.N., fin to hit a nigga's ass in the drought
In the town right now, (no doubt)
If you got a problem with Trae, let's get it on
Iggy on lock, so I'm back in a zone still packing the chrome
I was late for the hood, so I'm bad to the bone
Since I roll on the block, it's half of the bone
Shit just got wrong, you can hear it in my tone
(I'm pissed), but I'm still moving along
Yeah Jay'Ton, still grooving along
So the niggas in the blue, got love for the Home
For the H, and the West state
I"ll put it on a nigga, in the worst way
That'll be your worst day, and I put it on Trae
Motherfuckers better get in a line, or the dirt where you gon lay
This right here, for my nigga named Nick
In a hospital bed, half gone
I'll run up on a bitch nigga, who that out that shout out
Feel I gotta hit his ass, with the chrome
Nothing less, R-E-S-T-L-E double S
Stress, got a nigga on amp
So I gott mob for life, like 24/7
And I promise, I'm about to be the champ[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
We ain’t burning, liquor pour, bitches calling me daddy
I’m a thug, 357 straight out the caddy
New York about my shoe, just flew in from

A hood bitch, slimmy but her ass is fatty
I’m hot right now, my balls got a tin top on
I’m a movie and you missing some fresh popcorn
Levi’s
with a fresh clock on
Reasonable doubt, I was young getting my rocks on
Now I’m out in Texas, you traitor
Or either back home in the studio with Styles and Jada
Life’s a gamble, cards is dealt
I put the medal in your bitch face like Raymond Felt, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Fuck your mother if her son is a bitch
Fly from the barrel, one in the head, 16 in the clip
D block niggas steaming the spliff
Promethazine, gun, lean, and a whip
I expect you to not fuck with me
All the shooters, they throw it up for me
This life’s murdering luxury
Talking to the gun in the car like it’s my company
12 rounds, no boxing, no glove
From the hood, no option, no love
Gangsters don’t die, mobsters don’t buzz
When niggas do time niggas draw blood
Feel me

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
King, I’m on this hustle like I’m searching for keys
I’m on this block in position to whip a whole nigga’s ass
Damn right, I got a fucked up thinker
Run your mouth pertaining Trae
I'm dropping 4 in your blinkers
One in your stinker
Over stand up till I’m jamming my finger
I hit the spot and shake it down
And have it big like singers
I let this choppers go decrepit till it sound like arenas
Back up with 745s like I was shooting with beamers
Black twin, thick as hell, call

30 niggas, about that business like he fresh out the cleaners
My nigga say he wanna work I ship him off with the pay
Get on my set, whipping the bet
Our city in black, they fresh out the shack
Smelling like crack, get a moustache
pussy nigga
Trip with me, nigga, I barely react
It ain’t gonna be no nine lives, know that, cat for real

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Black strap, black ski mask, black flannel, standard
The rules of life but not manual
Go ahead, keep waiting for America to tan you
Discussing your life over shots of Jack Daniels
I-95, got to working in back panels
50/50, a slim chance, a fat gamble
Some niggas like to stay in the pocket, some scramble
Go through the progression, hit the target, blame you
Light something up with a freak and watch Scandal
They can’t even get on they feet but can’t stand you
Believe every chance they get they remand you
Allah would never give you nothing you can’t handle[Intro]
I’d like to dedicate this right here (Yea, this right here)
To all my women that going through a struggle
You know I came up to stay
I ain’t immune to the type of pain you’ve been exposed to
So this one right here
I’mma represent for each and one of y’all who have cancer
Yea, let’s go to my single mothers
Raising the house for the kids (no daddies)
Even the ones who’ve been beat up and abused
Break and left for loss
You know? Even the babies out here havin’ babies
I understand this a part of reality
Even my women don’t lie
All for protecting their set

[Verse 1]
He said he’d never touch you again
He left you prayin’ for the lord to get richer
A thousand tears leaving your face for every time that he hits her
Still so far from happy days but nowhere close to a smile
Try my good what affected you this shit in front of your child
Everything inside your heart telling you pack up and go
But the hardest thing out your life is tryna walk out that door
Cuz once you leave you know it ain’t no turning back, you gotta move on
Don’t worry ‘bout the stressing because you know that you strong
Go sit to a queen therefore you kind now put that shoe on
And walk in it with pride for all the pain and hurt that you saw
Come on! Past situations got you with your head lower
Looking at the girl in the mirror you swear you don’t know ‘er
They strugglin’ makes a woman at a faster rate
Even if she spiritually damaged it make her spirit great
Give me a chance, a real nigga step into the place
Set shine to whole before it’s too late

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather
It ain’t a day to come that I don’t wanna see you smile
I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya

[Verse 2]
I know you goin’ through it for real
So words can’t express how I feel
Each and every one of your struggles makes you one in a mill
I know it’s hard bein’ alone raising a house full of kids
And every day you do your best to try to handle your bizz
Not knowin’ how you gon survive so you turn to strippin’ or drugs
Couple pills to compensate in the place of lookin’ for love
It don’t matter where you been, you just need to know where you goin’
You wearin’ your body red, I’m tellin’ ya cuz it’s showin’
Everybody get a second chance plus it ain’t no room to be a victim of a circustance
You’re something special, Jesus put you here to handle pressure
He’d make that, listen, if you think you’re slippin’ He won’t let ya
And do the babies even know that weak ass daddies love ‘em? They steal the blisten
They angels in disguise that’s why I ride without a question
If you ever catch a person tryna treat you like trash
Halla at me, I’d come kick their ass

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather
It ain’t a day to come that I don’t wanna see you smile
I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no way to take back a life full of drama
Speaking for the streets, I must apologize
Don’t think you’re alone, I lost 2 sisters to a homicide
This my testimony to let you know how much you mean
You can be whatever you dream
You gotta know that you’re better than this so stop with the lies
You say it’s all good, I can see the doubt in your eyes
I know you’re fightin’ for your life so why you actin’ surprised?
You gotta wake up ‘fore you end up somewhere hospitalized
And I don’t wanna see it
I know the rain is so familiar, step inside, take a seat
Let it out until they feel your son is on the way
And through the faith you bound to see the better days
That there’s enough to get you move like in so many ways
That’s why I dedicate this song for the life that you been through
And every obstacle in life that you might just run into
You made too many, who can fill up your space?
So you deserve to put a smile on your face
Come on

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather
It ain’t a day to come that I don’t wanna see you smile
I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya[Hook: Tae - 4x]
Oooooh-ooooh-ooh-oooooh

[Trae]
Yeah the nigga okay but I feel he ain't pimping
Flipping 4-4's but I bet he ain't tipping
Dick riding the slab from the grain that I'm gripping
Hollow tips in the clip might leave a nigga limping
Flag on the right so I know he ain't Crippin'
I roll with five deuce so I know he ain't tripping
Unless he acting a ass and he ready for the whipping
I'll lean on a bitch Fat Joe edition
Back and I'm all about unlimited paper stacks
In a Lac with the swangas dipped in black
Fuck fly bitch I'm bringing the thugging back
I know my niggaz in the hood be loving that
Wanna raise on the block that I'm hugging that
See that bitch with that ass I'm rubbing that
Mouthpiece garunteed I'm hauling that
Niggaz say they got ice I'm dubbing that
Asshole with a hell of a attitude
Niggaz coming up bumping then I'm leaving 'em latitude
I bet they bitch ass know bout that there
Got my money right don't doubt that there
Unless you wanna see what I bring out
Twenty thee plus so they know I bling out
Hoes be on dick so the cell phone ring out
Representing till they let King D out

[Tae]
Call me what you wanna, playing with a pimp persona
Said that I get it from the corner, struggling no longer
I'm getting younger it makes you wonder, far thing from being under
Let the truth be told, I'm tired of the same ass game
Niggaz bullshit ways, step it up for a change
Cause I really just can't see, my self settling for no anybody
That be fucking with me, claiming that he got game but the big face seen
Just keep it real like a G, cause eventually you'll try to sell a dream
About getting money, so come correct with me

[Hook - 4x]

[Tae]
No Mr. wanna-be playas, I'm not feeling your ways
In my hand I see the grands, on my finger no ring
But it seems that you bout that change, not coming up to my mind frame
Got to be about your paper chase, 'stead of trying to run lame ass game
Just keep it playa, let me see you hold it down keep your weight up
But I know ya who thugging thangs up, keep it fly cocked for his paper
Rolling big bodies no sweepers, talking nigga ain't no need to creep up
Creep up, I'm the one on my team real niggaz just say just what they mean

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
They don't wanna see me act bad, like the young Trae
That attack the track, and hit it for the one way matter fact
I pack the Mac, for the gun play
Let it be known, guerilla niggaz do it one way
Any one day, in the drop fuck a Hondai
Loc's on my face, top dropped for the sun rays
Fucking with the Boss, three wheeling in a six tre
With a bitch on a nigga dick, down west state
Fo' do's up to the sky, with the hood falling
And I might sit cocked, for the boppers calling
Truck was crawling, slow from the weight I was hauling
Paint was glossing, so I'm with the fuck I'm flossing
Still I'm tossing game, from the H to Austin
Put it up on threes, like Bird in Boston
For the athletes, spit it till a nigga exhausted
Wanna hear the mouthpiece, but it might just cost 'em
I stunt, on a hater
Might not shine now, but I bet I shine later
Feeling like Pokey, half dog half gator
Bonafied thug, with a little bit of playa
Back on note for the pimp that I am, and the G that I be
With a game full of Loc's, representing for the C
In a click full of real, representing for the B
I'm a Asshole nigga, out the S.U.C

[Hook - 4x][Trae]
I feel it everytime that I hit the corner, bitch niggas be hating me
Been G since '93, and ain't no way they fin to be fading me
I roll with gorillas, and plus the hood is my habitat
All the real gon ride with Trae, and anything else see we ain't having that
I put this motherfucker on vibe, before I be going out like a part
They know my wheels, made displays out of my scars
So I'm real with it, they can just might get you killed with it
So I'm all alone inside my Chevrolet, plotting to get a mill ticket
And I'm cool, but I don't know who to trust
Even my lady flipped the script, for roach ass niggas with lust
Wish I was stress free, but since I ain't I gotta kick it where the rest be
Keeping it real to make it where the best be, test me
That ain't a good idea, cause some say I'm a asshole
Whether they like it or not, I'm gon get to see my grass grow
And I'm gon fight for it, until they see me breathless
A A.B.N. soldier, cause I was restless

[Young Noble]
From East Oakland to the H-Town, they know my name
Still nobody, still don't know my pain
Growing up in the game, I feel restless young but a old nigga
Seen too much too fast, it's fucking with my soul nigga
Born to be a outlaw, traveled down the road
Most of y'all never been, hope you don't wanna go
I tell em young nigga, don't try to be like me
Be better than me, be the best you can be
They feel the good die young, soldier you ain't done
Ninety percent of us, don't even get to make it out the slum
A.B.N., I use to cop the fat dime from Sabian
Come back to the hood and get blown, I was a baby then
Baby when I was younger, somebody should of told me
To slow down youngster, I know it's some'ing better for you
Then hugging this Glock, and ducking these cops
Then sent me the angel, in the form of pop

[Hook]
Everyday, it's like I'm back in the zone
Real life, got a nigga feeling like it's on
God can you help me, cause it's lonely on my own
My people use to be right, but now I'm feeling like they wrong
My roll dog, trying to tell me that I need to chill
But he don't understand, cause he ain't feeling how I feel
And how the fuck, do they got love for me if they ain't real
Lord knows, I don't wanna end up getting killed I'm restless

[Trae]
The streets can feel me, cause I'm in my zone and watching out for these niggas telling
Closer than my dame done came, to see convicted felons
And my state of mind just ain't right, jealousy in the air
How these niggas act I swear, they had the devil up in they swear
But I don't trip I throw my loc's on, when I fall into the night
And only acknowledge the real niggas, while the rest can't get it right
I'm on my note homie can't you tell, watching me doing my thang
I'm the real if you don't know, just watch me when I'm holding my name
Only less and less, moving at a pace they never seen
Ducking laws and crooked niggas, trying to get close to my green
Two heaters sitting on my hip, cause some of these niggas'll never lace up
And if they do, then I'm gon be the first to swell they face up
And that's gon stay the same, whether I'm broke or I'm balling out
Losing these dirty bitches, but I still hear em calling out
My life is on another level, squabbing at it's best
And everyday, I'm thanking God to keep my blessed

[Hook][Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bounce wit me now, bounce
Bounce wit me now, bounce
Bounce wit me now, bounce
Uh
I stay fresher than a motherfucker, cleaner than a pimp
Big 40 got me walkin' with a limp
With a limp, little nigga gettin' rich
Started off eatin' noodles, every night steak and shrimp, lord
Little nigga take a glimpse
Pockets say cheese like a nigga takin' flicks
Got a thick ho, she can't even take a dick
Fly nigga blowin' up, you would think I was a blimp
Or a plane in the sky gettin' brain from a dime
In the back of the jet only thing on my mind
Is the money and the clothes, cars and the hoes
And my little nigga probably growin' tall gettin' old
Woah
What your life like, sir
Money machines sounding like a typewriter
Probably eat the pussy but I wouldn't wife her
Off the floor, aventador,  I pull off like skrr (like skrr)
Kitty in the engine might purr
Sippin' on the lean so a nigga might slur
Promethazine make my vision go blur
And these diamonds on my neck and my wrist like burr
So cold, oh no I ain't gotta go go
Cause my prezzy rose gold
And I'm ballin' Pro Bowl
Romo niggas quarterbackin' with my old ho
But I ain't trippin, YOLO nigga

[Hook: T.I.]
Niggas say they keep a flame but it ain't like that
Try me I go hard in the paint right quick
Laugh at a nigga tryna take my bitch
In a new white 6, 4 or 5 white bricks
Bank roll like [?] with a bit like diddy
Broke nigga know you ain't rich as my clique
Got shit on my clique, nigga ask your bitch
I call her right quick, she'll get on my dick
Nigga get like that, get like that
Fuck ass nigga come and get like that

Sucka ass nigga can't get like that

Come and get like that, get like that
Ya'll sucka niggas can't get like that

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah
Ridin' in this audi bout to pull up in something you can't claim
Crown me in the city as king it ain't changed
Ain't no nigga hotter then me I'm covered in flames
I renovated the chains so haters could look strange
Young nigga fly on they ass, I got wings
Couple of trained shooters for haters, we got game
Still pull up in the hood get work and dumb change
Then pull up in your city get head and jump planes
Southwest rockstar, guns n roses
Bunch of heavy metal take a bullet to load this
Been a stiff nigga bet yo ass can't fold this
Niggas on dick tell them niggas to hold this
All black coupe you ain't seen how I rolled this
Everything ice nigga ain't I the coldest
Top laid back bitch I'm easy to notice
100 grand cash makes it easy to focus
Rich broke nigga, lord knows I'm hopeless
Straight up out of the gutter with the rest of the roaches
Louis vuitton belt put it right where the toast is
Puttin' bad bitches on my team like coaches
I ain't hit the block i call plays
Run off in that pussy then I probably part ways
Hustle gang bitch, count money all day
At the club  [?]    ball on em all day

Hundred in my pocket and my partner stayin trippin'
With a bunch of Cali niggas in the neighborhood crippin'
A nigga want to talk, send a nigga on a mission
Hit a nigga with a chopper make a nigga come up missing
Play no game nigga know my real
Save me the trouble nigga check yourself
Extendo clip nigga check my belt
All we do is get money in the game I rep
Hustle gang over everything nigga no exceptions
Talking crazy on the phone, I can't hear you no reception
A nigga try me and it's on, have mercy god bless him
I'm the mothafucking king why i care about a pesant
I'm chasing the  profession all I'm getting is the money
Lame ass niggas can't get shit from me
I got a group of young niggas go and hit licks for me
As for haters,  fuck em mane, never did shit for me
75 on the wrist got a hundred on the neck
Kill a nigga get a life sentence, done it for respect
Black rolls at the red another one in front of that
With a group of bad bitches say they want it from the back
A nigga try to do respect I ain't playin'  none of that
Shawty hit em with the Tech lay the nigga on his back

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the hood though
You see the dub is understood though
You fuck with me and it’s no good though
Now just let me get back to that wood though
This is foreign don’t try for murder
Evening cold on my body
I’m just minding business got bitches all in my lobby
Like biggie they want a chance, chances I ain’t gonna give up
Quality high standards told me you got to deliver
I’m still stuck back in nine c chromes I flipped in the nine bricks
In the hood by nine who to click, told me I don’t forget shit
Broke ass niggas I fix shit thanks to women that's real spit

Trunk is open all of my swingers poking
Fuck with me must be joking

Keep presidential spinach balls is up for scrimmage
Real with it fuck the image

Fireman might just light ya
Miggas they might just bite ya
Real niggas they can just bite  ya
Pussy I don’t invite ya

Yea I rip that ace time
This ain’t place to take a wife nigga
Got that call from paco
After bitch I got this
Like when I don’t got shit

Now we so true instead of poppin trunks and
Jammin through

[Hook: x2]
Rollin' dine the slab and I still look good
Pouring up the deuce and acting bad for my hood
Rollin' dine the slab and I still look good
Pouring up the deuce and acting bad for my hood

[Verse 1:]
I'm rollin' in the slab and I still look good
Throwin' up the [?] and actin' bad for my hood
Tell 'em I ain't trippin', If I had to jump lit his ass
[?]
On this glass I'm coastin', everything's slow motion
10 thousand dollar paint got me wet as the ocean
Sailing through the city in the swager on my ocean
Everything get dropped when they see it approaching
I'mma do it like Pat, HA dub k
Then there represent twin towers, ain't Trade
Can't forget about Screw, yea nigga we the shit
Anytime you see me, tellin' me Screwed Up Click

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Uh I'm rollin, nigga I'm holdin'
Paper tags and the damn thing's stolen
Bunch of niggas waiting on The Truth to fall off
I'm a full time jock, tell 'em call off
I keep bangin' the back with the trunk up
And got that thang in the back if you fuck up
I see you niggas steady watching me
Don't watch me, bitch you can't stop me
I don't get mad, I just get bread
I don't fall in love, I just get head
I representin' for the city, nothin' less
This for the north and the south, I'm south west

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Top let down, man hold up
Money workin' out, got my pocket swole up
Glass look amazing everytime I roll up
Trae hotter than the summer but the Rollie froze up
Hoes all on me so I guess I'm chose up
You can tell I'm going in when I let the doors up
Face goes down when the ass goes up
If she opened up, I ain't leavin' till it closed up
Slow loud and bangin' while I'm slidin' my slab
Trunk hittin' hard like [?]
H-Town Texas nigga you know how it goes
Get money, bitch I'm ballin' with the pros

My Destiny[** feat. Young Jeezy:]
[Trae {*talking} / Young Jeezy {*raps}:]
Cheeah!*
Street shit
(I got this yeah I got this)
I got this (I got this yeah I got this)
I got this (We ain't worry about em) naw
(We ain't worry about em) naw
(We ain't worry about em) naw
(We ain't worry about em!)

[Chorus (2x): ~Young Jeezy~]
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)

[Verse 1: Trae]
I tried to tell em I got this
I got this
Trae Tha Truth
I'm feeling like everythang relevant irrelevant nowadays
I thought I had a chance but now they showing me crime pays
The shit I'm living got me feeling like a old man
I been the H so where I'm fighting for my own man
They told me chill but this anger in my heart steel
My closes niggas turning on me like I'm cartwheel
I never played with disrespect nigga this score is real
If I was plexing and I still woulda fuck out'cha steal
I'm old school I never post up on this sneak shit
That's all in Houston you can miss me with that weak shit
Keep shooting undercover slugs dissing ass niggas
On the hood you bout to be some missing ass niggas
It don't take much to see these niggas out here fake as hell (fuck em)
All they ways goin have a nigga going straight to jail
I read these bitches like the numbers that's working the scale
And tell em being real ain't rated by the way ya sale
You looking for attention I'm about to make em famous
Soon as this shit get in the fan the pussy niggas blame us
I kept it loyal but these niggas loyal to theyself
I did it out of love they only did it for they wealth

[Chorus x2: Young Jeezy]
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
(So don't worry) bout these hoe niggas, been there before niggas
All they gotta do is ask I'm writing show niggas (ha ha)
Just to show niggas, that I can show niggas
What else I gotta say you seen my show nigga
1 2 3 4 here we go niggas
And I ain't never been a hater I'm like 'Yo nigga! '
Who's hot who's not I'm like so nigga
See they just warming up I'm hot as coal nigga
Probably why I'm platinum never been a gold nigga
The only thang he ever sold was your soul nigga
And they don't want me getting open I might close niggas
They won't give me no expose I might expose niggas

[Chorus x2: Young Jeezy]
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
I got this look look I got this (YEEAAHHH!)
I got this look look I got this (so don't worry)
So don't worry
So don't worry
So don't worry[Trae]
It's still the same thang ain't nothing changed, me and my dogs trying to have thangs
Flipping our cheddar trying to maintain, don't wanna go to jail but trying to hit stangs
I'm a G sitting back peeping game, on the block where the niggas might get ya mayn
4-4 slugs might hit ya frame, cause these niggas still wanna go against the grain
Steady trying to ball, just not knowing they about to fall
Want the love but they hate em all, wanting God but they ain't made the call
Niggas thinking they just too cool, fifteen years old dropped out of school
Trying to cap about what they do, drama come they better get that tool
They know death sitting round the corner, Lord knows they ain't ready for the reaper to come calling
They life falling ahead of time, and ain't trying to stall him
This right here is all that I see, T-R-A-E is all that I be
Same thang different day, gotta live your life by any means

[Hook - 2x]
It's the same thang, different day
Niggas know, what I mean dog
It's the same thang, different day
Same thang, different day dog

[Trae]
Collect call from the county jail, Kick Dog caught up trying to make the mail
Third strike and ain't got no bail, inside it hurt like hell
Everyday this how the world turn, in the heat but don't wanna get burned
22-Agg' might make him learn, he going through it for a hell of a term
Baby mama ain't make it no better, she know that you gone and she searching for cheddar
You losing your mind and it's really whatever, all the pain is your permanent weather
Back put up against the wall, pride ain't gon let him give up at all
Built up pressure bout to let go, so his outlook on life is fuck em all
My advice is to slow it down, ain't no type of kin folk coming round
That shit ain't right you and I both know, your dog gon be the one to hold it down
And that's life whether real or fake, reality is what you can't shake
It be the same thing everyday, the weight of the world might make you break

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
A new day but the same drama, everybody still wanna prove theyself
Let me tell it to ya damn fool, headed off to go lose theyself
He got beef wit you know who, hot headed for the hood near you
Letting everybody pump up his brain, loading up to see what you do
Dog you don't wanna go out like that, slugs'll get ya where you can't fight back
It don't take much for you to know that, six shots and everybody gon scat
Where ya dogs where ya friends, you back alone once again
If it's meant to be you won't walk again, fucking with them same ol' niggas again
I ain't going but I'm trying to show ya, everyday life is about to fold ya
Don't get caught up trying to be a soldier, you'll wind up dead when nobody know ya
That's the truth and it's simple and plain, don't let the devil get up in ya mayn
He'll have it when you gon lose your brain, in different ways but it's all the same

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Same thang different day, time roll by know I'm saying
Shit still don't change, it's always the same
Everyday reality, gotta take it for what it is you know I'm saying
Don't whine about the shit, just be smart about it
Don't be no fool, get caught up in the hype
Street life know I'm saying, that ain't shit to brag about
Some people, just stuck with that shit
My advice is get your grind on, do your thang
Do it on the low, you feel what I'm saying
Don't get caught up, fucking with these fake motherfuckers
Or your so-called friends, so-called gal
All that shit don't mean nothing, you know I'm saying keep God first[Intro]
Screw done already warned me - 4X
I'm fin to come through, with a tilted bumper kit

Screw done already warned me, bitches ain't shit
I'm fin to come through, with a tilted bumper kit

[Trae]
Guess who never left, but he back for the first time doing it like a star
Plus it's certified, by the way that I tip my car
Screw done told me back in the gap, that half these bitches wasn't shit
So I'm banging up the block one deep, while the slab recline a kit
Let it be known that we the shit, candy dripping and the dropper's got you under pressure
I bet ya that these haters sick, they better go get they ass a stretcher
This the South, home of the chrome shoes and the bang inside the trunk
We been holding since '99, I coulda taught you how to stunt
Haters love to see you fall off, but I just ain't gon fall off
Them tops be on the slab, but watch how fast I knock 'em all off
Them jackers I'm gon haul off, in the H we gon be joking
We gon shining until the death, and hope our wheels don't come up broken
Lamborgini do's, on the slab only for the hood
Ghetto superstars gon show ya, how it feel to be looking good
Tell me what ya know about Screwed Up Click, the ones who slowed the pace
And the ones who dropped the kit, and waved the trunk all in your face

[Hook - 4X]

[Lil' Keke]
Screw, done already warned me
That the S.U.C. army, is bout to start busting like a tommy
Stayed up in H-Town, where bumper kits lay down
Terrorizing the streets, like they school yard playgrounds
Bitches ain't shit, so I do it my way
In the 500 CL, just banging some Trae
We got some soldiers in the sky, and even mo' in the Penn
So that's mo' work to do, for C.M.G. and A.B.N
Threw 4's on a old school, cause slab is true
Laced it up with butter guts, over midnight blue
My click is on feet, my whole team gon eat
And I'm strapped with black heat, it make the ride complete
In the new driver seat, always be balling
If the trunk raise up, the bumper kit start falling
A Screwed Up legend, shit who else could it be
Then the resurrected reborn, infamous Don Ke'

[Hook - 4X]

[Trae]
Screw done already warned me, they wanna harm me
I ain't worried about em, messing with Trae I got a army
Plus a line of blue and red cars, that don't know how to sit still
Neon lights get woke up everytime, that they drop another 5th wheel
Better call the coroner, cause it's fin to get reckless in Texas
Plexers ain't never been a problem, I stay strapped for the jealous
And for Screw, you know we represent for the hood and the swanging zone
We draped up and dripped out, grey tapes we was banging on
Now them assholes done came, and we ain't playing homie
Anything less than real, we rearrange what niggas hanging homie
Matters what you banging homie, cause you know the South ain't on no hating shit
We represent the click, with ice that cost enough to buy a brick
The North back to the Southwest, my section gon ride for Trae
Don't think that it's a game, run up and watch how you slide away
The gangstas love it, cause I stay providing 'em with hits
So if you love the game, that took the bumper kit like you the shit

But back in the kitchen, at the end of the stove
Hey, T, looks like we at the end of the O
Drop a for in a twenty ounce, and call it 24
You sit on 24's, and we sip on 24's
Got the Caddy, sitting on a pair of Gucci penny loafs
Yeah I get money, fuck with bitches that get me more
Now you know the game, same shit different hoes
Yeah we cut the ears and the tail, off Mickey Mouse
Never been a rat, never had 'em in the house
Call me Captain Kangaroo, I got money in my pouch
And I don't mean loose change, when I say money in the couch
Ya dig yeah, I'm getting paid at what I already say
Can't see these niggas, like debris on these niggas
Got a bitch named Nina, and Nina so slutty
Cause she'll do him, and every one of his buddies

[Hook: Lil' Wayne & Trae]
We put them drinks down, and pick them tools up
And if dude tripping, we hit dude up
And you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up
And you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up
We drop the top down, and chunk the deuce up
These 84's'll make a hater, put his shoes up
Yeah you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up
Yeah you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up

[Verse 2: Trae]
I'm in the drop sitting low, 84's looking dangerous
My swagger got me in the hood, looking like I was famous
My neck and wrist, look like it been hit by a couple painters
I'm getting money, but the fact I'm gangster never changes
I got my locs on, waiting on a time to plex
Like this bopper shotgun in the whip, waiting on time to sex
It's A.B.N. until I rest, and won't be nothing less
Since I'm protected by the neighborhood, I never need a vest
I know them haters talking, but they ain't saying nothing
Long as they stay inside they place, I'mma continue stunting
My ice the shit, I'm prolly at a hundred stacks and running
I guess I'm fly, cause my do's in the air and trunk is humming
I'm still moving slow, my swagger just got off the chain
Whether the club or in the hood, I'm still gon make it rain
Yeah I'm the Truth, so please address it when you say my name
You try to take it to me, I'mma try to take it to your brain

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Trae]
It's still the same name, new whip new shoes
Fifty on the frame, so I know I won't lose
Kit is on fly, do's up when I cruise
All eyes on me, everytime a nigga move
I pop another trunk, and show the world I'm screwed up
This hey different color chain, will make you put your jewels up
Say bitch you better chill, cause I'll beat your dude up
Put him on the sideline, and have his face bruised up all screwed up
Oh yeah these diamonds in my mouth, showing I rep the South
This 80 thousand dollar bitch, got the top tooken off
Up in these streets I'm like a kid, cause I love to get lost
And stay packing something, that love to break a hater off
So when it come to this gangster, homie I got it locked
And if I put that drop on the block, I'm unable to stop
And when it come to what it do, I'm that number one spot
They knew I represent for Screw and H.A.W.K., banging my music chopped

My old G Hump done told me Trae it's bout that time to explode
So everybody in my way better get the fuck off the road
I'm on the rampage and there ain't gon be no cooling me off
Until I put it through a nigga disrespecting the south
I'm a guerilla out the click, and ain't no taming me
Plus they got me heated cus niggas ain't who they claim to be
But still they claim to be the S.U.C. and I ain't feeling that
H-A Dub show me the sign so I can bring they hat and lay them flat
Across the concrete and that'll show them what the business is
Hit them with the hook and that'll show them what my feelings is
Copycats get a tat 'fore the mack in the Lac
Never slackin on the back of the track, I'm a fool that's a fact
Then again I ain't having that when it comes to flowing I'm sick
Bitch, give me 50 feet and hop the fuck off of my dick

[Chorus: H.A.W.K. x2]

Certified gangstas ain't takin no shit
Got everybody tryin'a steal our shit
Now give us 50 feet and get the fuck off our dick

[Verse Two: H.A.W.K.]
Now give us 50 feet and get the fuck off our dick
You punk bitch, you criss switchas steal our shit
I'ma come down, I'ma come through
We came down and through since 1992
I'm a protege of Screw, one of the hardest ones
Put you on a cavilary and a dangerous tongue
I'm the mouthpiece of the Southeast, on weak niggas high feast
Back back, gimme 50 feet, or I shall reach your piece
Better stay out of my reach, and stop stealing my lines
Niggas singin my songs like old school nursery rhymes
Yall niggas far behind, I can see you in my rear view
I can spit a punch line and smash your whole crew
Yall boys is boo-boo, and yall boys is so through
That shit yall do make a nigga boo-boo
I drive these niggas cuckoo, really ricka voo-doo
Representin Screw-zoo like Lil' Flip and Bahdoo

[Chorus: H.A.W.K. x2]

[Verse Three: Mr. 3-2]
Now boys wanna be me, walk in my shoes
They don't fit, sound like the big boss of the Screwed Up Click
I'm dick, there ain't but one Mr. 3-2
Playa, ass nigga that always stay true
Who is you?
Who is that tellin lies on the mic?
Better get your game together can't come up overnight
I'ma write, get mine, puttin it in the stash
Once you have the last laugh with a whole lot of cash
Street game roll something depending one deep
Grindin it out but mothafuckers feel decieved
50 feet ain't enough, I need a little more space
Take over, monopolize
All up, in your face
H-A dub and my nigga Lil' Trae
Ready for pistol play anytime, anyday
Okay, it ain't a game all chumps get squashed
By the Screwed Up Click, and Mr. ... Big Boss

[Chorus: H.A.W.K. x2]
All chumps get squashed by the Screwed Up Click
Certified gangstas ain't takin no shit
Got everybody tryin'a steal our shit

Do it, do it, do it
Screw it, screw it, screw it[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Niggas think I changed, cause I'm actin different
Bitches say I'm trippin, cause I'm tryna get it
But where were they, when I was on my knees, askin God please save me?
Shit so crazy, shit so crazy
Shit so crazy, shit so crazy

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Shit so crazy sometimes, feel like I'm constantly pasing
I remember nights praying, to catch a better situation
Irritated with all the stress I was facing
Now the only moves I make is for this paper I'm chacin
No time is waisting, so I gotta do what's best for Trae
Anything different, they need to move, it's only in my way
Like who the fuck is half these people? They can suck my dick
Take they opinion, and shove it somewhere it ain't post to fit

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Niggas think I changed, cause I'm actin different
Bitches say I'm trippin, cause I'm tryna get it
But where were they, when I was on my knees, askin God please save me?
Shit so crazy, shit so crazy
Shit so crazy, shit so crazy

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I told myself these niggas bitches, don't fool with these niggas
And told myself that half the bitches is cooler than niggas
The shit they was, till they started dealing with lack of attention, and ended up on sespention
So now I get my mug on, cause I know I make love gone
I gotta make that cake, so I don't go back to that drug zone
But even if that shit happen, I probably keep my plug on
Fuck seeing them teachers, that ain't teach me nothin
I can't never let 'm shift me out my position, I was focused, I just hope my people listen
At the end of the day, tell the world I'm on a mission
No one loyal, so I'm making my disision

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Niggas think I changed, cause I'm actin different
Bitches say I'm trippin, cause I'm tryna get it
But where were they, when I was on my knees, askin God please save me?
Shit so crazy, shit so crazy
Shit so crazy, shit so crazy

[Outro: Derez De'Shon and Trae Tha Truth]
What you drink? Don't make me piss, nigga
What you eat? Don't make me shit, nigga
Your opinion is like a penny
All that shit that you talkin, really ain't making sense, nigga
I mean, like, when the fuck was it decided I oah you niggas somethin?
Nigga, I stay in my own 2 shoes, nigga
On my own 2 motherfuckin feat
Do what the fuck you doin, nigga

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Niggas think I changed, cause I'm actin different

Act like my shit don't stink, pocket feel like a bank
Neck lookin' like a 40 ounce of O.E
Tell me why my album selling, they ain't murder me yet
If they do, bury me in a burgundy 'Vette
Talk behind my back, you could hate me all ya want

I can't do this shit, not another day
So sick of being broke

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
In the morning I wake up, I'm tryna get a check up
I'm Sick of being broke (I'm so sick of being broke)
In the trap all day, studio all night
I'm tired of seeing dough
I know it gotta be another way, 'nother way
It gotta be another way, 'nother way
It gotta be another way, 'nother way
I know it gotta be another way
Cause I can't do this shit another day

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
My attitude got me pissed off
Everything 'round me fucked up
Why the fuck I ain't on?
How them niggas lucked up?
This fake eyed guy just fell down
I still ain't put the scale down
I'm sick of seeing broke
This shit damn hot like "bitch I'm hellbound"
No sleep and I get no resting nah
I'm so close but I keep on messing up
I'm holding on but I feel like I'm blasting up
Too many niggas in my hood confessing up
All my life tryna get me a chick
Sitting here broke don't get you respect
I'm in the trap but a nigga wanna switch up
But if I give it up I can't keep my connect
Hustling like my gas slow
Nigga, I said my cash low
Bills ain't take no break
So you know where that cash go
I'm somewhere in my old hood
Thinking of a new day
Yea bitch I'm on that same shit like fuck it ain't no new play

It gotta be another way, 'nother way
I know it gotta be another way
Cause I can't do this shit another day

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Sick of waking up cold nights
Ain't got location seeda
If I fail I'm strapped with this heater
Yea now, fuck the world I don't need her
I'm in the studio 'til the sun kicks up
I'm in the trap 'til sun fall back down
And I know that it gotta be another way to have my lil niggas on the block put the Mag down
Stand up nigga, never sat down
No matter what this shit is I don't back down
Every day I'm in the gutter all black down
Throw'd bits in the crap getting picked down
Got kids that I gotta make it for
Hard to rap when you stack your paper flow
Then at nights I don't know what I'm gonna do
Guess it all depends what's makin' more
Down to my last cents, yea being broke so past tense
Strikin' it, tryna flip shit
Like fuck it, where my last whip?
Every day I wake up
I'm tryna get this cake up
I'm married to the streets
If she don't pay then we gon' break up

In the morning I wake up, I'm tryna get a check up

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
It's a new year but drama got me stressing again
So I'm feelin' like I'm barely missing my blessings again
Say a prayer, then I load my smith & wesson again
It ain't no tellin' when these niggas gon be flexin' again
From all the mist that I was in they said I'd end up in the grave
I would end up in 8 buck tent for the rest of my days
If they coming I ain't, runnin' the ghetto is where I stay
Real nigga, find me up in the gutter, that's full of strays
See the acoustic is to have me feelin' I'm out of time
And I might tell you something wrong but I'd tell you ain't nothing fine
If I was anybody else but The Truth I'd probly be cryin'
Yea the talent of the paper, if I found out he wouldn't mind
Man I look like I'm a make it but fuck it I'm gonna be tryin'
Niggas say I'm out of line but I say I'm out of my mind
Niggas betrayed or be dyin', but I give it to you – they lyin'
Watchin' niggas come around and hopin' not givin' them shine
I'm gettin' sick of this shit

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)

Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Every time I look around I'm seeing shit more worse
I ain't heaven or blessed to look at, I just got cursed
I go to trippin' when I think that I'll be put in a hearse
Then I wonder why didn't they come and get the fake niggas first
The way I'm feelin' got me lookin' for a permanent nurse
That's why I put Maggie Priscilla what I feel in a verse
Everything I did was real, I ain't never had to rehearse
So tell them niggas who is or get the fuck off my turf
Yella my bang, so go and get a seat and relax
ABN GANG, I'm 'bout to pull up in packs
And I f I tell you I'm the realest I'm just statin' a fact
I guarantee I got the reality from roaches and rats
The Truth is here, them other think you niggas is gone
You may just lost it, wonderin' like the signal on my phone
Standin' alone, you pussy niggas know what I'm on
I make the first nigga who's talkin' reevaluate his tone
I'm gettin' sick of this shit

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
Gettin' sick of this shit (gettin' sick of this shit)
But I'm not gon' quit (But I'm not gon' quit)
I've come too far (I've come too far)

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Take a look at the niggas I thought I was cool with
2000 and 20, niggas you be on that new shit
The feel like I offs in but I don't owe niggas nothin' but never
Think it's like fuckin' my bitch, they won't do shit
I get out of my shoes, I'll introduce you the whole time
Dissin' when I speak, I'll introduce you the whole rhyme
Thinkin' about people around me that got took away
I'm a thousand miles already and I won't stop 'til I fall down
Pressure, probly just enough to make you lose it
Cause the reel in my seat, praying I don't have to use it
Only fear God, nothing else and don't confuse it
Loyalty ain't the same, fuck niggas gon abuse this
Sick of their lies, sick of their crimes, sick of this pain
Sick of this rain, how fake are these niggas speakin' my name?
Shit ain't the same, been that way since I got bigger with fame
I'm a hold my head high and never hold it in shame
Bitch, I'm sick of this shit

Sitting on top of the world

[Trae]
I really wish that I was, sitting on top of the world
Cause lately I've been in my own zone, stressing so much I'm about to hurl
I don't wanna lose my focus, in case you ain't noticed it's hopeless
In the ghetto, cause niggas'll hold you down and never let go
But I maintain, ducking and dodging the rain
Wishing one day I'll get away, and be on top of my game
Cause for Trae, everyday struggling is what I get to feel
If I feel anything else, I swear to God it wasn't real
So I mash on, and get my cash on
Fuck being broke, everyday I get my stash on
It ain't no telling, if I'ma get to see the better days
I would rather be living, so mama say I better pray
And forget what them niggas say, I know they be hating mine
I've been stuck on bad luck, I don't think they want mine
So I remain, hoping God gon put me on top of his list
I'll probably never get to see it, so for now I sit and wish I was

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
My mentality of being broke, done got me trying to get it
But I don't rest, so everytime I touch the game I'll be the best and never less
I ain't got shit to lose, and I want the bottom to the top
So everyday I give it all I got, a hundred percent and never ever stop
I ain't gon quit for shit, even though my pain is forever
I lost a lot with paying dues, and tried to keep it together
It's like I'm zoning everyday, and then I'm lost in a daze
Since I'm addicted to reality, I'll be stuck in my ways
And I can't change it if I wanted to, with what I'm going through
It ain't nobody, trying to help me through
That's why my attitude be out of control, with all the time they gave my dog
I bet he losing it slow, but still I tell him not to fold
I'm gon ride for the team, and try to make it to the top
And if I never make it, least I'm still respected on the blocks
I know it ain't a lot, but in the hood I'll be a legend
Helping people make it through, they hard times for a blessing like I'm

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
I never knew, if I would end up being po'
And if folks but still I knew, that I would end up being realer than most
And maybe that explains, why I haven't made it yet
I can almost bet that you niggas, don't get no respect
Selling your soul and playing dirty with the devil, I choose to be a rebel
Never teaming up with that sucker, cause I'm on another level
And it ain't too many on it, I promise I'm a loner
Ever since me and my brother separated, I've been goner
On the corner trying to get it, the best way I can
That's why I choose to get up and get out, and be a man
And it ain't no giving me respect, I'd rather take my own
And ain't no running from death, I'd rather be toting chrome
And I don't think that they wanna see me, on top of the world
Cause if they did then they would fear me, when I be stopping this world
From all the bullshit, these niggas be filling it with

Riding all through this h-town street, do you understand me?
Real niggas do real things!
So your hood should be in the air right now
Oh, I know you all see us out here, right?

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
So much candy paint, all of this codeine

I got my kacky creased, heavy stars I'm h-town
Just got off the phone with jay prince
They bout to hate now!
I’m throwed
Slowly moving down this road
What don’t kill you makes you stronger I was told
So I carry the load, 2000 pounds of dro

I'm slammin’ doorz

[Hook] x6
Slammin’ doorz, pulling them hoes

[Verse 2: Trae]
I’m in the slab
Looking in the memory challange stunna
Premeditated I blew the brains out and left it with scrilla
Presidential elected king of the streets by the gutter
With the wrist...
I am the streets, so tell the pussies quit clamming my name
If you ain’t tippin fours with hood
Respect me or nothing the same
You can still can find me where your favorite gangstas never go
Probably in the rich popping the trucks
Slammin’ the doorz

Hop in this whip and lets swing these 84's
And grip the wood

[Young Buck]
Feeling just like I should
Take a nigga life I could!

Gripping that grip while I flipping that porgery
I make them see that quadren
Hustlers I never be that gowers
Fuck what you’re worth i’m charging
Still high behind, they make shit that is blacker
Everyday I make a movie but I’m no actor
Now with the truth you not the factor
One in the head is the risk of the jackers
Ain’t ntn go for the team of traitors
I get a greenlight that’ll go and attack you
Now you have no one to go and back you
Because there are other people paying
Others to pack you
Say what you over there vibing on
How you falling off of bitches I’m falling on
Go to play with my purple lining on
Go long got sports shining over
Pull up with that new rolie timing over
And I think it’s by 48 hours later
In the boost cause it make you greater
Doing me cause I don’t give a fuck about haters

Maybe a nigga don’t know how to act
Chuck up in them while I make this pack
One of them nigga they hold me a sack
They sipping cordenes but before they had act
I do not freestyle and I do not matter
My wife is a kilo and bitches are better dre
Get so much money you haters can’t handle that
Live to see the back and bitches be loving that
Rollie be on me when I’m in the grave
40 on me if you trip I’m a bay
Them realer nigga ain’t no getting me paid
Folds poking while I’m holding her leg
All in the game me and you fakers are nothing the same
We are the takers you niggas is laid
Spread you niggas if you play with my name yea

Whipping that engine when I pull up beside you
Bitch I’ve been pulling stunts like machiver
Three on the corner there ain’t nothing liver
Slamming the water looking like a diver
These niggas are pussies they are nothing but vagina
Don’t give a fuck hope they can remind you
Open the tit like who can find us
Smoking on something that captain debate
Greenlight yo ass and get shot in the day
Ain’t no mistake bitch I’m riding with trae
Dragging my bumper while scraping the plate
Pull down my stakes gonna be time to play
Knocking knocking now riding with trae
Pussy bunkers when I pull up the play

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth
Coming down the boule’ moving slow
I was draped to drip right out the door
Everything was clean like what you know
You ain’t down with Screw you got to go
Riding glass, me I call it fours
I’m the shit, you sense it through your nose
Bang all through your body like it’s blowers
Pop the door, you feel it through your toes
Rack for rack, I guess I got to count it
After that, it’s racks I got to count it
When I’m done, I package, out of town it
I done lost my mind and never found it
Keep a light like I’m Coors
Brand new house, I’m pissed, too many doors
I guess my shit way better than yours
I was getting platinum, steel, getting awards
I’m gon’ go tonight, I’ll show you rif’
You not tryna win, I’m not your type
Fresh out Texas, might just take a flight
Hit your bitch and greet her with the pipe
From the back or in the throat I might
Beat it up, you think I’m tryna fight
Something foreign, skin she got was bright
Chain was black, the diamonds on it white

Fuck the crib, I’m tryna shine in public
Nigga I ain’t finna play with ‘em
I’ma swing any day with ‘em
I’ll trip and the K get ‘em
Jump line, you’ll stay with ‘em
I used to be creased up, jeans creased down
Down 16, going south, east bound
I was caught up in the game, no rebound
You ain’t sounding like Truth, can’t be ‘round
I was slow, loud, and banging
You don’t know that nigga, what was you dranking?
I rep the city from Collin to Rankin
I went to business with Benjamin Franklin

Chasing this check I'm not talking athletics
But I keep my money in lockers
If I make the call just know I got young shooters
Who ride like American choppers
They hustle for deal in that kitchen they cooking
A fool with the D like Ibaka
No medical dealer but for the right price
They prescribe Actavis like a doctor
Drop this wet, I call it rainy weather
Chopper's disconnected like it's not together
Mister Truth is fly and I am not a feather
I just hold these rocks up like I'm Roc-A-Fella
If your bitch is lame then I am not the seller
She can be with me it's what I'm not to tell her
Like to play it low like I'm a acapella
If she here for dick then I am not to fill her
Give me my check if not a minute later
Swangers I'm tippin', should've been waiter
Look like a swamp cause everything is Gator
You don't like me, then bitch you been a hater
I'm sick bitch, I'm sick I should've been a fever
Fuckin' with me, the trunk is where I leave ya
Gon' be a minute 'fore someone relieve yah

You not gettin' them racks, oh where they do that at?
My neck, my wrist, my ears, and my fingers are sittin' on wet
I told that lil bitch to hop into my coupe, treat her like a lil pet
Copped me a Vette then I wrecked it, then I copped a Bentley and wrecked it
I got real shooters
They pull up with woolas and all kind of TEC 9s and Uzis
We talk on the phone I just tell 'em stay reckless
My bitch she gon' shoot, she a buddha
Chinese and Japanese
Her eyes looking closed
She gon' chase till she capture me
These pigs are so after me
This ice on my neck is so wet like it baptize me
I get that dope from the pope
While I get sex on the banana boat
I can't save her, she better stay afloat
I'll contain a baby for that dope
Whip it! Whip it! 'Til I have a stroke
Cook it, throw it, catch it, no Ebola
Treat my dogs like bacon no con-soda
Told you once I bang red, Coca Cola

You know
I never did understand why they always told me to smile
Shit
It ain't too much shit I gave a smile for
Real talk
Yo still a asshole by nature
Peep game

[Verse 1: Trae]
I remember comin' up able to love nigga watchin' niggas fuck over
They over sea I kept it reala
But bein' real ain't really always what niggas make it to be
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin' a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Penitentiary's the life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcomes it's always safe to pray
And try to do my best to understand he write a rhyme away
I got a call from Mr. Rogers just the other day tellin' me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin' 'bout 'til he told me Lorna died
It fucked me up so much I couldn't even go to the wake
But if her family called I'm gon' make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The more people I love the more they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God a lil more than the pastor
Prob'ly been livin' to make sure my son never become a bastard
I've never been the one to quit I've always been the leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I ever had this I never took the time to meet her
So I feel a frown across my face the only way to greet her
In the process of bein' Trae I missed out as a child
Prob'ly cuz reality must stop
And they told my cousin death before he thirty after checkin' his pile
He damn near 28 so how the fuck am I supposed to smile shit

I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I supposed to smile

The hood too foul
The lil niggas is wild
Men lost trial
Hit 'em with some numbers he ain't eatin' doin' chow
He ain't even sleepin' he been thinkin' 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for a while
Same bullshit try'na get you a money pile
You don't see the reefer or the jail doors locked
I keep a tech with the air holes cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot
But Pinero's not
Gon' fuck with these fuck niggas or air those Lox
It's real hard to sleep when its money on the mind and
Murder on the mind
Puffin' on the dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody mom cryin' cuz somebody boy dyin'
It's the same ol' shit
Wait till the funeral
Same ol' trip
Crack money rap money
The same ol' grip
As Trae could've smiled out in Texas
Livin' reckless

Then live after breakfast

Nothin' to smile about

Give you half the gage

Couple months in the group home in DFY
Truthfully what could have been pending, never did
And he slid
As a youthful offender cuz he's a kid
Problem is

He comin' home thinkin' it's sweet and don't expect it
Big but he's still young
To him it's still fun

I'm on a neverending vacation
Until my tires go flat
Or everything fucked up and gonna fall
Off track. Picture me like a Kodak
Re-up, nigga, they know that
Dealing like I ain't got shit
Work in back of a throwback
I'm cold up in this hallway
Hustling out it all day
Trying to get this money
And that Audi 8 in all grey
Haters say it's over but
You can tell them I'm busy
Professor with the ?
? with a Smith & Wesson
Trying to make it to the top
100,000 miles away
Somewhere in Gabon, where guerillas known to
Fly cage. Pedal to the floor, I don't know
Where I'm headed, but I know if I'm headed
Somewhere that ain't for me, then you can get it
Business from losing folk, sick is from insane
Tell em I'm coming for it, stomach's the same thing
Nothing like a lose, I knew I was here to win
Fuck em if they close the door, knock light, I'm coming in

Feeling like there ain't a chance but I still try

But still I got so far to go

[Verse 2 - Meek Mill]
I used to play the corner with a 40 on my hip
Hanging in my ? how I'm gonna get up out this bitch
Coppers trippin, I admit it I was dirty as a broom
I used to take it in the crib and write my raps up in the room
Trying to chase a dream, who though that I'd be cover
Of these magazines? Fresh from a jail cell, greasier than Vaseline
I went to BET from running around with Mack machines
Busting shots and ducking shots with killers right in back of me
I never had a choice, I never really spoke a lot
I never had a voice until I started making noise
I went from running with my boys to crushing niggas round the world
Them bitches used to turn me down but now
I'm fucking all them girls, yeah. I'm from a city where these
Young'uns doomed. I was upset my father died
I turned ?. Forever killed it, I was ?
So I retract ?

I still got so far to go
9th-degree black belt in the Art of Blow
Cook pot and a spoon in my arsenal
School of Hard Knocks, made the honor roll
7 grams to a key, I was on a roll
Haters couldn't stand it, I took it for granted
Misplaced a bag of money and didn't panic
Yeah, on my road to the riches
Baby-blue diamonds and them hot yellow bitches
You can't cancel our Christmas
Italian roadsters, high yellow stitching
Yeah, what the fuck is y'all pitching?
Hall of Fame with the O's, Cal Ripken
My hands still in the snow like mittens
Got my weight belt on: power-lifting

I got my pistol on my side, and you know it's on cock
That's an automatic, everytime I step out on the block
If a nigga didn't know, it's time to send him to class
So give him a front seat, to get a bullet in his ass
I'm a G, but I guess you probably already heard
I can get your ass whooped, or I can get you a bird
I can get your ass shot, without even having met ya
So if you wanna know if I'm a gangsta, you bet ya
I earn stripes and scars, in street fights and wars
Put holes in niggas cars, with no types of pause
So don't test my gangsta, I don't play them games
I'ma pass you with flying colors, and drop your lane
Ask around in the hood, who run it
Bet a motherfucker tell you, Big Bun
It ain't nothing, that a trill ass nigga can't do
And that include a bitch nigga like you, it's true

[Hook]
(I'm so gangsta), they don't wanna see me in the club
When I mob through that bitch, with the Crips and the Bloods
(I'm so gangsta), haters better sit they ass back
Cause the hood in this bitch, and we'll stomp they ass flat
(I'm so gangsta), same niggas posted on the block
In a drop, with a bitch and a Glock
(say homie I'm so gangsta), ice worth about ten grand
Middle finger in the air, with my nuts in my hand

[Trae]
These niggas got it twisted, but now I'm gon set it straight
A.B.N. up in the building, and holding it for the state
Who they said gon get the throne, tell that nigga he gotta wait
If he want it then he can get it, I don't tolerate the hate
I bet they thought that it was safe, but now they know guerillas coming
Mobbing up like we the mafia, fighting and even gunning
First nigga out of line, be the first to be getting some'ing
I'ma take it out his mouth, and then slide him up under some'ing
See I play it how it go, don't give a fuck about the fame
I been gutter since the birth, bitch I'm the leader of the gang
So know that if I click, then my set gon get off the chain
And put they ass inside the clutch, and start shooting like Danny Ainge
With they flags to the left, flags to the right
Lacing up they kicks, then that's your ass all through the night
We can get it on motherfucker, like a title fight
Violate the code, and watch this nigga get up in your life

[Hook]

[Trae]
I'm here for the drama, and it ain't no other way that I'ma live it
A.B.N. until the death, so niggas know how I'ma give it
Still I come around the corner, illegal in something tinted
Packing something, that's the price of that house that your mama rented
I'm a sick dude, homie you don't wanna fuck around
Cause I run with niggas, who fuck up everytime they touch the ground
And that beefing I don't think you want it, your teeth'll never get found
You don't like the way we kick it, bicth nigga so move around
You don't wanna get me started, my attitude something fucked off
When I get inside the club, these pussy niggas need to duck off
Cause I could make em swell up, with something they ain't gon dust off
Have em sitting in they zone, but they sleep cause they lights done cut off
And this is for my gangstas, and my niggas getting cash flow
Hit the block in a drop, with a bitch to let that ass show
If you ain't feeling me nigga, fuck you and your ass
Punk bitch, I'm a motherfucking Asshole

[Hook]

I'm so gangsta, I'm so gangsta
I'm so gangsta, say homie I'm so gangsta(*talking*)
Yo Boss, hey turn them headphones up for me my nigga
Trae the Truth, Young Chill told myself I wasn't gon get back in that zone mayn
It's like this track you did, keep calling for it though
I feel it's one of these motherfuckers, make this song cry
Straight up shit never fail mayn, this motherfucker got me in a zone
It's a lot of you motherfuckers, that did a nigga bad
You got me fucked up this time

[Trae]
No matter what happens, I promise I keep it real and never be fly
Something like Jigga, cause I gotta make this song cry
Never no emotion but I feel I need to share my pain, come on stand in the rain with a nigga
See how I feel on an everyday basis, when hard life took aim at a nigga
I never thought that I'd ever see the day, the people I got love for turned me away
But it is what it is, the only one left to trust is Trae
I got a child on the way, and it seem to me I ain't gon see it
My baby mama wanna see it dead, cause she say she don't need it
And I be wrong, to play an eye for an eye
But see her devilish ways, can stay and see me rolling on by
Hateful bitch, loyalty is what I know and I don't know too many with it
Homies left to click to kick it, with niggas in higher digits
And I ain't mad, I was hurt for a sec
But I learned, that I gotta be strong and hold it down for the rest of my set
Plus my baby Neeko, getting older now
You and Jared relax, cause I got you on my shoulder now daddy on his way up
Nobody finna bring me back down, it's war and I won't back down
The weight on my shoulders prolly weigh too much, but I won't slack down
I click and I drop the Lac down, and mob as I'm thinking
I'm unable to cry, so it make it hard when I'm thinking
No way to thin out, but I thank the Lord for leaving me my family
A.B.N. and M.C.G., the only one living to handle me
My nigga Dougie free, to see me make it through them gates
When I get my chance, I'ma come back and guide you to the plate
It ain't never too late, we just gon hope that we can get to see it
And I'd give my last breath, and my last smile to get to see it
Danny Boo, I know that you lost your mama and your daddy gone
But know I'm here to be your guard until Dinkie come home
I've been feeling it lately, I'm getting shorter than life
These niggas try to stop my day, but I came through the night
And if I gotta go, just know someone gon keep me living
And this is all that I'm giving, ain't nothing else I'm feeling[Trae]
You must be out of ya mind, I'm from the south and this the realist
Check the resume, and that'll show the world why we the trillest
In that black on black Excursion with the hood facing up
And 24 inches on my shoes the only way I'm lacin up
ABN is what I'm claiming, with a slab that's rearrangin
Movin slow cause I be screwed up on the block, then I be bangin
I ain't thinkin about the plex cause we can get it on
Four straps and a extra clip can show that they can get it wrong
Yeah I'm from the south - where they be trappin, or they grindin
Diamonds that got 'em shinin
Trunk stay in the air, showin somethin while they reclinin'
Drank up in they cup, but see myself I keep it sober
Run up on me wrong, it's guarantee it's gon'be over
Screwed Up Click soliders, wide frame rollers
With a set of hands to make you look beat up like a nova
Trae gon'stay Tha Truth and that's the way it is
Houston, Texas in the buildin', gangstas gon'be feelin this[Hook - Shyna]
You're so, so special
You're so, so special
You're so, so special
You're so, so special

[Verse 1 - Trae]
I woke up early this morning
But all I can think about is what keep me going
And it ain't no denying the fact I gotta ride for the ones who love be showing
July the 3rd you gave birth to the man I'am today
And I probably go insane if life ever took you away
I remember like yesterday you use to be my best friend
No matter what I did you're be right by my side in the end
If you need it I got it ain't no question about it
We struggled all off our life but now it's time I get you about it
Mama I promise to god I ain't never leaving your side
And everytime I see your face you give me the smiling inside
You mean the world to me and ain't nobody gon' jeopardize that
You the main reason I'm alive I can't never forget that
Debra Denise who ever thought that we will get to see this day
Your son been grinding it for years and now we finally on his way
To be something that'll make your proud
I bet we never seen it coming
Plus I got a chance to showing
To a very special woman
Love you ma

[Verse 2 - Trae]
D'Neeko Deshawn Thompson your daddy be thinking bout you
Like everyday all I know is that I never wanna be without you
Since July the 23rd the day you came to this earth
I finally got a son on my own only the lord know what you worth
I might like get to be around you 50 percent of my time
You better believe every percent of my time you be on my mind
Lil' daddy you some special just like the day that I met you
I'm a be there whenever you call and the time that I'm gon' regret you
I was the first to see you smile and you don't know how much it meant
Can't let nobody take you from me cuz I know you heaven sent
Everytime you make a sound I laugh and look you in your eye
And your ways seem like you fly
And that's a trip it ain't no lie
I can you see rapping like daddy or maybe even playing sports
Either way you gon' be pimp if they don't like it take us to court
Meanwhile I thought I let you know that your daddy appreciate you
From turning my dark to light and it was a blessing I couldn't creat you

[Hook: Shyna]

[Hook]
The devil working so I pray
Cause what I'm holding, I'ma spray
I don't wanna die today
Too many niggas acting gay
And I don't got no time to play
The squad I got is on the way


[Verse One: Trae Tha Truth]
Asshole to society, navigating this Chevy
I'm just tryna pull up and hit 'em with something heavy
Tryna Kevin Hart me a nigga, he wasn't ready
Bullets got him doing the Wap, like he was Fetty
God fearing gangsta, nigga, don't get it twisted
Bitch, I been the king of the streets, you couldn't miss it
Tryna see my powers, don't worry, it wasn't listed
One shot, all on the line, you better risk it
Bet yo bitch do, when I pull thru
Yeah, she a monster with the head, I'm tryna fuck her too
And when I finish, I get out and jump in something new
A bunch of pussy niggas hating, so I'm never through
I hit up 'Ton and Don The Boss, what's cracking with it?
Streets looking kinda lost, so I'm back to get it
Slab sailing thru the South and I was captain in it
I keep a trap full of work, you think a staff was in it


[Hook]
The devil working so I pray
Cause what I'm holding, I'ma spray
I don't wanna die today
Too many niggas acting gay
And I don't got no time to play
The squad I got is on the way


[Verse Two: Jay'Ton]
Asshole By Nature is the definition
Niggas playing games, got my full attention
Send goons at noon, on an expedition
Have 'em shooting tunes out that Expedition
With the full extension, respect the game
I'm talking bird for bird, they underneath the plane
Talking check for check, I never need the fame
Drop cocaina, never seen a stain
Whole team in the ghetto
Codeine, kush, I'm a fiend in the ghetto
Hustle got a nigga living dreams in the ghetto
Bitch, I'm in the hood, you never seen in the ghetto
Look, fuck nigga, jump fly and I'ma pull up
Seven six-two's go to flying, get you put up
Ten toes down, everyday a nigga stood up
Now I'm at the crib, one deep, with my foot up


[Hook]
The devil working so I pray
Cause what I'm holding, I'ma spray
I don't wanna die today
Too many niggas acting gay
And I don't got no time to play
The squad I got is on the way


[Verse Three: Trae Tha Truth]
When it come to the streets, every nigga gotta see me
Everything I do a movie, shoulda been on TV
Go to playing tough, homicide, call the PD
Chopper hit ya whip, get ya spinned, like a CD
Riding for my niggas in the cell, 'til they be free
Playing with the keys like a Mac or a PC
Swear a nigga hustle got the world tryna be me
Niggas out here tryna be the man, but I be he
Money resonated over waters for me and my team
Way I got it Coming To America, call me Hakeem
You don't see my hustle something serious, get ya Visine
Ya gal recognize it, that's probably why she gon' try  things
Yeah, I pull up in fly things, it ain't no way to stop that
The hood is where I rock at
Trip and get ya popped at
Asshole sailing this ship, like "where the dock at?"
Throw mine, let one in the chamber of something cocked back(Hook)

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

(Verse 1)
Now I done kept it real straight out the gate, do what niggas didn’t
10 seconds out the struggle just enough to make niggas different
I used to give a fuck but now the fucks I gave and kill no mo
Everybody snakes like they ain’t know you from the day before
Look here, I’ve been focused, I ain’t worried bout the smaller shit
Man before anything, getting good, I ain’t called the shit
Walkin on my own two, regardless what I go through
Speakin on niggas tryna get famous that’s what I don’t do
Validated the street’s credibility, can’t get to back
To front another gutter gorilla, I came and took that
15 years I’ve been in this motherfucker ain’t left yet
Good hearted nigga, others play 30 like ain’t sweep yet
I started from the bottom now I’m here, made it on my own
Other niggas hope I get distracted, I’mma make it home
Even as a kid I skipped the playground, hit the block and rolled
Might do this shit with passion but to others it’s another song

(Hook)
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

(Verse 2)
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama’s house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we...


(Hook)
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga

(Verse 3)
Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I’ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I’m in the house
Cause we...

(Hook)
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga

(Bridge)
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

[Verse 4]
Came in the game and I’m landing the changes
These fuck niggas they say it in 10 different ways, then see you just smile in yo face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smoking that fire, my nigga you that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
A bird in the pound, bird in the pound, bird in the pound
Yea, it’s going down, it’s going down, it’s going down
Uh, started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, I went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the lear
All black coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin
Hope the homey Dre don’t get pissed but niggas
Never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin, we just talked about the money we been makin
‘Cause we

        [Trae]
You see me on the block every T I roll off
The trunk raise up and everything else fall off
Slabs is automatic if the South get called off
The top raise up and the 4's will crawl out
And I use to be a broke nigga stacked up
Now I gotta watch out for the roach niggas 24's close
Fuck timid and I blow nigga, anything less than ten G's a joke
Come to the H I can show you who the king of the streets is
Trae, I can show you who king of the beats is
I can show you niggas what a hundred G's is
A.B.N. gang might leave a nigga teethless
Nigga never heard now I'm all up in they face
Like a bad yellow bitch I'll be all up in her waist
Hit her with the mule now I got her all up in a brace
So sick with the game that it should of been a case
And my chain hang low ice fed when I strut
20 G's plus still capping on sluts
J's laced up when I'm slipping on cuts
And I never been a hoe so they know I got nuts
Pass me the ball I'ma run it for the team
Fuck respect nigga I'ma run it for the green
Cop the new whip candy black looking clean
Tilt the do's up hopping out Sean jeans
Loc's on my face two straps on my hip
Blood on my right to my left is a Crip
Plus I got shit that'll make a nigga flip
If I get a attitude Assholed finna trip
They fucking with the dub but the hood got love
Riding for the truth till they put him in the mud
Any other way I'll be coming with a slug
H-Town motherfucker I'll show you what it was

[Boss]
I'm a motherfucking fool when I pull up on a switch
Game never lame when I pull up on a bitch
Mouthpiece got 'em sick
Hard dick and bubblegum is all that a chickenhead bitch gon get
Can't fuck with my ends if I get rich
Don't scratch up my Benz blue lens with Lorenz
Niggas don't like when the end sit low
And I pop up on three with a mouth full of chips
I'm your girl's best friend
Call a nigga with my name falling round town for knocking these hoes down
All up in my hoe see I beat my do's down
From state to state breaking the plate on 4's now
You see how the H ride bumper kit
Break a smoke on my 3's I'ma stomp a bitch
Got hoopers on my side that'll jump a bitch
Six foot Zip-Lock sack lunch a bitch
If Boss don't bang right go on tell me bitch
I'ma load up a clip right punching bitch
I see niggas in the streets wanna act like they G's
Bang like I'm at home when I'm sailing the seven seas
True niggas in my zone but I'm trying to get rid of fleas
If you in 5200 don't fuck with me please
I'ma stack up some cash and pain for real
When you see me banging a bad bitch out of Brazil
Trying the product on a mill with a drank that sit still
Cut Khakis Chucks with my laces on still
Check out the tats bitch check out the grill
2 double 0-6 bitch check out the deal
I'ma make a bitch made nigga stretch out for real
Like a Sunkist niggas get peeled for the scrill
You niggas is hoes I'ma call you a tip drill
A.B.N. gang never less than a mill[Verse One: Lil B]
We back killin roaches and rats
Like bugs these niggas skat
From a trap I come but they ain't ready for combat
We the pest control spraying every crack
Clap black wit black mags and black macks
They don't really wanna see the whole click do that (nigga who dat?)
I thought you hatin niggas knew the slow loud and bangin
Be makin a nigga move back really not a koo kat
I stay ready for war, Lil' B the G nigga that will rush ya car
Before I break ya jaw, like I break the law
Niggas on the street know we untamed and raw
I'm down to get down for my cousin Trae, Lil Boss Hawg and my Nigga Jay....ton
Leavin a hater flat wit a brace on
We be the niggas that rollin tall, nothin but chrome
I'm a renegade never perpertrate
Niggas hate but like Boss I'm a scrape the plate
Congragulate a nigga we ????
We can go to war nigga jus pick a date
I'll be the nigga that bust and don't give a fuck
Leave 'em stuck wit mack hollows all up in ya truck
Niggas duck when shots buck don't push ya luck
Cause we the niggas on and make 'em give it up

[Chorus: Billy Cook]

[Verse Two: Lil' Boss]
Too many niggas be out fakin the funk

Hit a nigga upside his head wit him a cpouple of lumps
And jack slugs in the lac wit a couple of humps CAUSE!

Lettin another 44 slug up in ya face
Have a nigga dodgin the game, like he was Mase
Laws come wit me they gon have to give a chase
Cause I ain't the nigga that be catchin a case

Scrapin the plate, shakin the fake, bakin the cake
Droppin the front. makin a break
Wrappin a pistol grip I'm finsta trip
And slot slugs shootin a nigga wit out missin a grip
I don't miss the blood I don't miss the crip
And the other shit, maabin gangsta shit
And my khakis saggin and my classic rag
Dont mean to boast or don't mean to brag
Since down wit S.L.A.B I been actin bad
Hataz get a .44 bag wit toe tag

Big bow laces and a new rag
Some these niggas be actin like fags

[Verse Three: Jay-Ton]
So I'm a mack, I'm a g and I ain't playin no games
Piss me off and I'll be takin my aim

Off the chain when I'm swangin in the drop frame
I know these niggas better get outta my lane
Fuck wit me nigga you outta yo brain

Quick as hell wit it to give a nigga pain
Damn there must be haterz in the place

And I hop off swole when I'm hoppin off the weights
Run up on a nigga hittin hard like fraits
Slugs make a nigga do the harlem shake
Sticks and stones make a nigga bones break
DAMN thuggin ain't easy baby
Pull up on the block in a black mercedes
Fuckin nigga talkin bout tryna fade me
Niggas talk close shit on the daily

Theres been a lot of shit on my mind from back in the game
I'm a asshole and a never inaccurate aim
When I pull up and hoppin outta wide body frame
Eveybody and they momma better hop up outta my range
I ain't never been a nigga from a small town
Get the white chalk
Ima show 'em how to ???
If they stood Ima knock a nigga jaw out
That will teach a nigga bout coming around the wrong route
Hit the block in a drop top wit the lights off
Wit a shotgun
Then I knock a nigga lights out
Finna I bop and weave and hit him wit a right cross
Be next to see ya nigga gettin hauled off
I'm the nigga that be runnin the block and ???
Yo niggas know what I got a 17 shot wit a Glock and a mask on
Wit a clip that make a nigga get his ass owned
SHIT why they wanna get me started
Everybody know that I'm already retarded
With a attitude to prove that I'm the hardest artist
I'm shuttin everythang down regardless
Slow Loud and Bangin Ima rep for ever

**till fade***[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
Don't be thinking about my money, nigga, no
Anybody try to stop it, they gotta go
When I pull up in this new shit niggas know
Probably run up to your bitch with another ho
In these streets I'm still the king
And I wouldn't sell out my city
Probably made to come to move
And I be bringing my city with me, Houston
Gotta get this money right now
Gotta get this money right now

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
I stay trill
Fuck niggas ain't shit to me
And that's how I feel
Pussy niggas keep testing me like I ain't real
All this money I'm getting, bitch, gonna blow it still
Somewhere off  in this traffic, ain't time to chill
This just how I feel
Nigga, that's just how I feel

[Roscoe Dash]
The only way to live your life is to keep it running til you get to the pesos
So every single day of this life I'm trying to get it
Cause enough ain't enough till I say so

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
All I do is get to the money collecting a sack
While broke niggas be talking, I’m shining,  they way in the back
Got so much a my money on corners I run It like track
Like I dunno wana hear bout nuthin if nuthin don’t stack
Imma be in the spot for a minute tell em take focus
Cuz I'mma focus on hatas til everyone of em notice
If I’m forever the king of the place they say I’m the closest
Can’t nobody compete with the truth they say im the coldest
Pussy niggas keep testing probably cause they was stressin
When see me pull up hoppin outta something n flexin
Everyone a they hoes lookin at me like I'm a blessin
Bout a send em a message and I ain’t talkn bout texting
I get doe til there’s no more
Other niggas wanna shine but all I do is wanna get more
In the city ridin solo if it ain’t fast cash everything else slow-mo
I gtta get this money my hustle got me going insane
All this money keep on calling my name

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
I stay trill
Fuck niggas ain't shit to me
And that's how I feel
Pussy niggas keep testing me like I ain't real
All this money I'm getting, bitch, go through this deal
Somewhere off in this traffic, ain't time to chill
This just how I feel
Ain't no time to chill
Nigga, that's just how I feel

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
We forever on the paper chase
We chase paper, never time for sleeping, better wake up
And cake up, ain't talking about no money, what you say?
I can't hear you, you're breaking up
Nigga, get off of my cell
If you ain't calling me about me making a mill
Or me making a sale
We money incorporated here
The product he was producing, orchestrated here
And if you look into my eyes
You'll see the reflection of dollar signs
My mind chaotic like the stock market
You would think a nigga starving because a nigga go hard
In the paint go hard if I can't get through
See the domino effect when I knock em off the edge
Mo money for me
And if you wanna try to rob me
You better ask somebody and understand what you coming to see
A nigga coming with heat you better watch out for Frank-Lin
We the true definition of the phrase
Made men, Braveheart, stay hard
Let me shine, let me get a little light, you can stay dark
You can stay pushing filla's in the park, I'd rather move kilos than be your boss
A nigga wanna run shit so I'm never on the dumb shit
And always come equipped
Don't be messing with my money, nigga no
See when Krayzie pull the pump, then I kill em all
The bill collector need his ends he won't ease up tonight

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
I stay trill
Fuck niggas ain't shit to me
And that's how I feel
Pussy niggas keep testing me like I ain't real
All this money I'm getting, bitch, go through this deal
Somewhere off in this traffic, ain't time to chill
This just how I feel
Ain't no time to chill
Nigga, that's just how I feel

[Roscoe Dash]
The only way to live your life is to keep it running til get to the pesos
So every single day of this life I'm tryna get it
Cause enough ain't enough till I say soYeah*
God bless the dead

[Hook: ~R Kelly~]
Even tho you gone you will always be my nigga
Yeah we made it home I'm still missing you my nigga
I'm feeling like the time it was wrong my nigga
Do your shilling down saying carry on my nigga
Sometimes my light skin get long my nigga
Sometimes I feel God did me wrong my nigga
So I had to write a song my nigga
Just to let you know that'cha still my nigga

[Chorus:]
I wish, I wish, I wish (woah why)
I wish, I wish, I wish (still my nigga)
I wish, I wish, I wish (woah why)
I wish, I wish, I wish (still my nigga)
I wish, I wish, I wish (woah why)
I wish, I wish, I wish (still my nigga)
I wish, I wish, I wish (woah why)
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 1:]
What's been up with'cha homie, I know it's been a minute
I'm going through it thinking how the fuck it ever ended
I'm feeling like it wouldn't meant for them to come and get'cha
Damn it goin be hard to expect it knowing I wouldn't with'cha (fuck)
I only pray that'chu in heaven I'm going through hell
It ain't easy fighting with pain when you know I'm so well
Sometimes I wish I can see you and just talk
Grab my kicks and giva fuck where we going and just walk
But instead it's like I'm all alone, everything going wrong
This shit got me confused, like were the fuck is home
I spend my nice away in places where I don't belong
Today I got the right to hurt I'm sick of being strong
Memories of me and you left me in touch with anger
Now me and my smile look at each other like we total strangers
It's like I'm running on emotion covered up with pride
The day you left the day that something inside of me died

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
A couple hours on my knees praying heavy til I fall asleep
Struggling to live still I'm trying seven days a week
Looking at this picture of you only got me stressing hard
Tho I know it's wrong I feel like who am I to question God (who am I)
I only wish that I can bring you back my nigga
You kept it real so I'm a do just that my nigga
Today I'm here but nothing guarantee the latest
Shit I just got on the news and seen they just murdered the homie Gatta
They say the time here wounds in the hands of life
Mine a came and when I feeling like I missed it twice
I know we sacrifice but why you had to pay the price
Homie it was me and you but now it's me and rainy nights
And when I die it's where we pick up
You more than a brother don't ever once think I would switch up
I'm feel like I'm nothing but yet I stand when other niggas out here thanking I knew it when half ain't shown up at'cha way
And nothing real about

[Hook]

[Chorus][Hook: Russell Lee - 2x]
On the Southside
Candy sprayed, looking so live
84's and vogues, we glide
Screwzoo, you know we holding it down

[Trae]
I'm still low behind tints, swanging to Southwest
A lot of shit on my mind, still living the stretch
Screw-U I miss you, ain't a damn thang changed
To the day I'm deceased, I'ma rep the name
Holding it down for the South, and the S.U.C
Ahead of the pack, forever S.L.A.B
And swanging 4's and vogues, low with T.V.'s
The trunk popped up, and showing that I'm a G
Out the Dirty Southside, of H-T-X
In a throwback drop, or a four do' Lex
With a throw away Glock, when a nigga got plex
I'm fresh off the block, slow-mo in a Vet
Peep game when I grip the grain, I'm off the chain
Down the baseline, and cross over the lane
Like A.I., my game is too fly
Blue over gray, when I pass on by
I'm a B-E-T, and a Southwest thug
Beat down the block, and banging on dubs
Scrubs, back back give me fifty
Cause wanna be thugs, don't get no love
From the Maab or the click, Slow Loud And Bangin'
From the beginning to end, I ain't never changing
And the East to Westcoast, is what I'm ranging
That candy blue, on locks that I'm staging
Rearranging, your changing thoughts
When I hit the vault, pulling out candy cars
Like Randy Moss, I'ma play the field
On the hunt for a mill, displaying my skills
Southsive for live, repping my block
My hood on fire, streets is on lock
With the shit that I got, I'm never gon stop
For Screw I'ma punch the gas, to the top

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
If I'm pulling out the garage, better believe it's mine
And if the light is on me, then I'ma go on and shine
Baller block niggas, on glass when I hop the lane
It's a damn shame, the way my top drop and swang
My slab doubling, and niggas be thinking that it's a game
Trae ain't the same, and leading the line like a train
And I'm in the cockpit, that glide like a plane
When I'm on Fondren, I be heading down to Main
Like a pimp, hoes I got by the flock
In a CMC, and low key from cops
I'm on the grind, trying to stack my knots
I put about four G's, up in the stash spot
Bleeding the block, at night when I get my cash
And wood all on my dash, with leather under my ass
2-55, with full speed to mash
When the bops on the block, I'm full speed to pass
Like Dizzy Young, cause I'm young and raw
With no love for the law, that hate a young thug
That's real in the streets, and never been fake
With artillery, for niggas that I hate
Cause I'm playa, ain't no way to knock that
When it come to the click, you know I got that
So you cats, better play the back field
Cause I'm the homerun king champ, and I'm next to bat
For the Dirty Southside, and the Wild Wild West
When it quick to click, or putting the drama to rest
I'm telling these cats, they don't wanna test
Cause the click full of G's, just might cause a mess
When they in black Houpes, and they ready to ride
Believe me, G-Maab ain't playing no games
I ride for the set, to the day I quit
And if it ever come to that, then it's over mayn

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
I represent for the Dirty 3rd, when I shake the block
For P-A-T and Mafio, I'ma drop the drop
Body rock and catch hot, when these haters jock
And on top of that, watching these boppers bop
On a G like Trae, since back in the day
When I tip the Houpe, and flipped up Few Quay
South Klique for life, with BJ And Lil' Shay
My brother Jay'Ton, and the rest of S.K
But now I'm in a first class, four do' slab
Getting my shine on, and beating up the Ave
Still on the Southside, got niggas mouth wide
Piss me off, and I'ma fuck up they inside
Outside, when I let up my trunk
Six fifteens, and yep they gon bump
Think of touching my shit, you bound to get stomped
I ain't never been a punk, you chose to get dumped
One deep or with a click, I'm still gon ball
In a DTS, the screens is gon fall
T-R-A-E, I play the game raw
Fin to set this shit off, with no time to stall
For the Screw K3, they done dropped the chain
And the guerilla got loose, that they tried to tame
And now they feeling this one, from H-Town to Spain
Now niggas in the game, be looking so lame
When they see my 4's, running niggas out the way
When I'm fresh out the Jag, on candy blue sprayed
When I'm fresh out the Quay, on customized
Six T.V.'s, banked up on MLK
T-I-N-T, black on black I'm thoed
So these niggas don't know, what I'm working with
Or what I got inside, late night when I ride
It's gangstafied, I know you feeling this

[Hook - 2x]

(Russell Lee)
We gon hold it down, On the Southside
Yeah, of H-Town, it goes down[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Young Andre, playin 3 Stacks
Diddy on the work, tell him, take that
In the kitchin, tryna whip up a cake, yeah
Only a hot nigga, tryna shake back
And if you ain't eatin with me, then you better stay back
Trappin with magazines, all they do is stay back
Meanwhile, I'd rather stay with packs
Gotta get m, gotta get it till they lay flat
I was sittin in the cut, ain't have no cover
You could see it, your life ain't had no drama
Always in the hood, no way to sign out
Streets full of hate, but I guess I had to find out
Every day's like I'm runnin out of time
Thinkin bout my neck has got me runnin out my mind
Gotta get everything, staying on the grind
If I could see it, I know I'll be fine

[Verse 2: RaRa]
Big bro sold dope off the dog phone
Big Boi track, the boss home
Out in LA, tryna plan my day, need a young rich girl to put her mouth on
Gained a lot of pain, when I seen this shit
Life keeps goin, can't dream this shit
Die by the money, and I mean this shit
Who fake bustin, knock out his teath and shit
The cleanest shit, cream get lit
Huston Hero, 90s kid, the night is young
You know I got a strap on me, you act on me
Talk that shit, run that lip
Spendin real hard, for the hard, nigga
That's wwhy Icount that shit real hard, nigga
I'm the one runnin with no frauds, nigga
I'm comin out hard, on god, nigga
Bought for my kids, to do that bean
Bankroll Fresh, I do it for B
Came on back, the comeback kid
I'm in this bitch, to win this shit
Spend a hundred bands in the projects
Lookin for a plug in the outlet
Bad ass hoe, with some bad ass kids
Suck a nigga dick for an outfit
I ain't got no manners, I ain't goin lie, nigga
Ain't rock with Stunna, you can feel my pain, nigga
Young street nigga, really been in the slammer
When I made these diamonds, saved my life
For the hood I'm greatfull, put my swag on maple
Stuntin all day, and all night, boy
These chains got me lookin like a slave, boy

[Chorus: RaRa]
Woke up this morning, smoke me a blunt this morning
I thank god this morning
I sware I'm doin better this morning
Last night, thought I wouldn't make it
Last night, shit really got real
Last night, got on my knees, prayed that I still here

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Tech on the seat when I ride through
Fuck them niggas, they could die too
See, fuck the pussy niggas, they lie too
I got a beutifull stripper, make you cry too
Make it to the top, or Imma try to
You pitifull, I'm tryna buy too
A bitch tryna see where I'm tryna fly too
She never let me hit it, but she say I can try to
In the trap, don't open or close
On the block, the doors open and close
Got that white, they play with they nose
Fuck the hate, I get m exposed
Everything, the rest, it comes and it goes
I get high, I grab up a boll
I can't get behind you, you niggas done told
I'm the realest, you niggas done fold
If you don't rock with me, I'm not your kind
I had to wait, but it's my time
You speak for me, you out your mind
Bitch, look at you, you really out your mind
Everything I spit, make sure it rhyme
Got all the guns, make sure they fine
Nigga, if you cross that line, you pay that fine
Gotta secure that bag, I'm on my grind

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth]
Woke up this morning, thank god this morning
Countin up doe this morning
I swam at Joe's this morning
Last night, shit, I thought I wouldn't make it
Last night, shit really got real
Last night, got on my knees and prayed that I ain't gotta deal[Intro: Trae tha Truth speaking]
Yeah
The undisputed king
Nigga I am the street, shit - haha
Trae tha Truth
Pyrexx
Yeah

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
If you looking for the realest I'm here to give you the biz
King of whatever them niggas yelling they is
Any nigga got a problem, well then tell 'em who it is
I didn't stutter motherfucker, you can tell 'em who it is
Got a temper that'll beat a nigga up under the flow
With a pipe that I probably sticking up under your ho
If they wanna get it in, tell em I'm ready to go
Got a trap, I put it somewhere up under the snow
When they come to get money, then tell em I'm all in
Drama you looking for, this topic will fall in
If it go to work, then I bet that you called in
In the back of this Phantom out the side that I crawled in
If I did it, don't worry about it, tell em it's all me
If I did it, you heard about it, tell em it's all G
Put you out of sight for a hell of a small fee
People give a fuck about if you had a show or tell em that it's free
Come and switch it up, you niggas fucking with my minute, get it back
Tell em I was sick, even sicker when I hit a track
Never been one to give a fuck about what you feeling
Cause if you feeling anything different, I ain't feeling that
Yeah the king back
Team is all black
Green is all racks
Rachine is all that
Anything I'm in like to transform when the sun go
Fourth wheel stunt while the fifth one lean back
I bet you never seen a nigga who talk for night
No matter where you at, I bet I'll light up your life
I'm a star, at the same time hood with it
Set it off, I bet like Mary you're praying to Christ
So my advice, if you see me with Pyrexx
The gang's somewhere round and ready for whatever bitch
So just know when you fuck with gorillas
Gorillas gone show you what's really whatever bitch

[Hook]
I'm strapped up, black mask
Still gangsta, in the hood
Set tripping, still thugging
Real nigga, understood

What they talking, I ain't tripping
Chopper loaded, I ain't slipping
Now you're leaking, should've listened
Fucking with the game will leave you missing

Strapped up, black mask
Still gangsta, in the hood
Set tripping, still thugging
Real nigga, understood

What they talking, I ain't tripping
Chopper loaded, I ain't slipping
Now you're leaking, should've listened
Fucking with the game will leave you missing

[Verse 2: Pyrexx]
I'm tatted up, all white
Pistol loaded, what they talking
I ain't tripping, Trae I got 'em
Like I'm getting money when I'm up from the bottom
P-Y-R-E-double-X, Pyrexx, you can tell I'm a beast with the flow
Every in caine's in my vo', when I go, I'm a show, with them motherfucking diggers in the globe now
Got Trae on this track with this white boy
Yeah well it's like out of this world you would think I'm black
But I ain't, but I got a black heart with a blue blood bumping out this motherfuckin' track
Uh, yeah, I'm not bitch, "Free Pyrexx" was a movement bitch
Whatcha wanna do, fucking with a fool
One phone call Trae get the click mobbin' bitch
I'm from the hood, northside
Northwest psychers home
That's right
Don't get it twisted, on mine
I can run with the gorillas from the southside
So I ride with a cocked nine, never stop mine
Fitting to rise and to shine, I'm a get it in
Never will I give, get it how I live
After doing this bid y'all gonna really star, star


But even in my raps, my style, my flow is gone but everybody know
Till I'm out on me, everything give away big up to the tone we gone get this dough homie

Best believe when I step out I'm a shine bright with a mouth full of gold
Six point stars on the teeth
Known for the cheef
Fuck with the camp on the ground when you go

[Hook]

[Interlude]

They don't need to come to the streets only this six in this close
The hood only me I'm close to person I'm never from being

You can play this thing but they still gonna be realest ever
Never saluted by gangstas plus I'm respected and TDC
Look at they craze being in streets like I'm the only one that they feel But the do lane and all the hate but my gangsta remain still
A post to child be a definition to when they say it's real

Cause they come happy other rappers be undercovers
I might not shine as mush as the real nigga gonna get your face down Get a thick to speak the tree & watch the hood plan as they street [?]
Get out the truth and play the pitch I'm like the streets deal
My name stay on the corners like rumors the streets that get lose
Call me the cleaner man this hope nigga for less choose...
Put the Billboard I even come us on magazines
But still I'm made religion cause here there's nothing I've never seen
The nigga with [?] before I go head to team
I head the [?] so to the bottom like more than before we hear the dream
I got the movin in this streets they say is out of order
But they gifted like yeah soon as my voice touch and recorded

[Verse 3]
I'm the bullet up in the chain but is danger soon as I climb though
Took a player with can't get your thing put up in time moe
I lived the torch and now rap stratchin and tryin to put mine though
They scared I'm go exposing and leave the city to find though

Tell em the passage by abut now I'm back for what they owe me

Say I'm here but I'm here don't tell me I'm pimpin
And if I wouldn't leave em spillin being in their topic
Since one of the realest niggas did it they never and I start it
Without a profit and represent it like Jordan while other people over thug the hood like we couldn't afford them
I stay to keep it real while other soul [?] without the shit they got it never equal my respect cause I'm a king

Cheyah

Ha Ha
Okay
Let's get it
Uh
Your now tuned in to the streets
Such a regular broadcast had just been canceled
Trae Tha Truth
King of the streets
And this a new one this year
Street's Advocate, nigga

I heard some niggas trippin'
What it is mayne
Bitch I'm a grown man
I ain't for playing games
A major factor in the city that these niggas claim
And in a corner gangstas they yelling a nigga name
Some haters want me in the streets, well what'cha waiting on?
You gone need more then paramedics try'na take me home
I'm goin' expose any character try'na play me wrong
I beat that ass outta order like you was... (Mike Jones)
I heard the logic tell a fake niggas fall as he get
Well bitch I'm right here now they ain't gotta be dealing shit
These niggas mo' pussy then bitches who famous in flicks
These niggas sick the truth the only one issue in hits
I heard it's mercies, just give me a reason
And I see something through that household that rep when you leasing
It's me against the world I'm feeling like I'm Michael Vick
The industry don't wanna see the truth, tell them niggas to quit
I ain't a Rap-A-Lot no mo' Records serving the rabbit
But me and Jay Brothers for life, fuck with him and I'm scraping
First nigga track goin' be an example ya think we slacking
This A.B.N. Rap-A-Lot Mafia, bitch what's happenin'
I went to sleep and woke up with the same vision as Pac
And let this unified go and re-incorated the block
I rep the streets cause I'm the king and niggas know I'm in it
These niggas rap about the hood but me I go up in it
Tell the media fuck they camera, I ain't photogenic
But picture this standing out on some four doors and tinted
See I expose them in the light, then I damage they image
With these gorillas pumping something the color of spinach
My street credibility straight, it ain't nothing to fix
I did a show running my man told em copy my brick
Fuck a case, these bullets will drop of a snitch
So let em know the hood I be, I be hopping this bitch

[Talking:]
That's the realest shit I ever wrote, nigga
(Why they keep on calling my name?)
You know, I don't know what the fuck they been sleeping on
(Why they keep on calling my name?)
I feel like I need to slap they ass across the head and wake em back up this year
(Why they keep no calling my name?)
You know, I ain't gotta jock no album, huh, I gotta drop mixtapes in days
(Why they keep no calling my name?)
You know I am commonly, it this goin be how I feel like being in a tentery

Motherfuck yo, mother fuck yo
Motherfuck, motherfuck, motherfuck yo

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
Nowadays I feel it's strange
Streets are different, this shit changed
Fuck these niggas I'ma get change
In the hutu strip like ain't shit changed
I swear to God this shit changed
Won't play the same, I gotta switch lanes
Real nigga, can't fuck with no lames
I play for real, I don't play games
Real nigga, can't fuck with no lames
I play for real, I don't play games
I swear to God this shit changed
Streets are different, this shit changed

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm in an all-black wardrobe, finna hit the corner
Life is a bitch, you can tell her I don't want her
Bitch named nina, dead nigga run up on her
Fuck niggas nothing like me, I'm a loner
Everything real, I fuck em around the corner
Yeah I'm from the gutter where it's hotter than a sauna
Something like Floyd Mayweather when I go off
Your faith that I have [?] run up on ya
Never been a fake, tell em I'm real with it
Truk nino, [?] with it
Never gave a fuck then, you can tell em I'm still with it
Eff a hard nigga, you can tell em he's still with it
Tell em I was one of the realest that ever did this
Call me David Blane, would work the way I hit this
622-50 [?] street built this
Everything I touch I murder nigga, I kill this

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
Bitch I'm still here, nose dive to the coffin nigga
Feeling like the hood wanna off a nigga
Can't please everybody, too cold for niggas
I'm the same motherfucker who done fought for niggas
Bled for niggas, fed them niggas
Might have left a motherfucker dead for niggas
But I be God damn I'ma say it for niggas
They gon' tuck their tail if I [?] for niggas
[?] back in his good
Gladiator showed up like a pack in the hood
And you can call it what you want I got rack in the hood
Fuck a burner you die from a shank in the hood
So I wish this West stay hard hear us
Still press on, I'm, pressing yards fear us
Ducked out from you fake niggas
Ho just come bless what the yard give us

[Intro][Hook - 2x]
Niggas be stressing me, niggas be testing me
Taking my kindness for a weakness, in this industry
Niggas be stressing me, trying to get everything for free
Knowing that anything worth having, costs a pretty penny

[Billy Cook]
I gotta get raw, this time around dog
Cause motherfuckers, thinking they can push me in the ground
Just saying do anything to me, expect to know my peeps
So this song goes out, to those haters who envy me
My point exactly, they ain't gotta be a platinum song
Just as long as you get the message, you hear in this song
I got a lovely remedy, for this shit
But in the face or the mind, ghetto platinum hits
When you doing something right, niggas got something bad to say
See I ain't trying to please, these phony busters anyway

[Hook - 2x]

[Billy Cook]
It was some niggas on there, sure was talking about my hair
Now they're broke, and they're all what living there
How you gon let a nigga like me, slip through your fingers yo
It's kinda like you hit the lotto, then just lost it all
See I'm a ghetto platinum nigga, I'm gon shine this year
Y'all can't stop what God has for me, it's so crystal clear
So now sit back, relax and enjoy the ride
You had yours on, now it's Cook and Trae's time
Don't start none, won't be none
Don't start none, won't be noooone
Don't start none, won't be none
Don't start none, won't be none

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
Still stuck between real and fake
But I'ma eliminate fake, when I beat the hate
I'm on my last leg, and on the verge of clicking
And these cats ain't gon learn, till they come up missing
Niggas taking the help, that I give for granted
Me and Cook been wrecking shit, for too long
You better get your ass up, and get your stacks up
Trying to roll chop for me, and get you messed up
I'm sick and tired, of these wanna be fake type
Industry hype, all about the limelight
Living life shife, and ride a nigga dick tight
Better go on, cause I'm the real nigga type
And I'm squaring it off, till it's over
Stress done got me, running out my mind
And I put it on the line, each and every time
Since they messed up my vibe, now the haters mine
It ain't no more friends, ain't no more foes
Ain't no more kin folk, and no more hoes
Just me and the Maab, and S.L.A.B
And I'ma rep my click, until the curtain close
Lord knows, I'm due for earning my crown
I done waited my time, and now it's going down
Trae and Billy Cook, Stress the remix
Life in the street niggas, better move around

[Billy Cook]
I ain't trying to start nothing, ya'll can feel fa sho
I keeps it real can you tell, by the way I spit it yo
This is the first and last time, thugging on a negative vibe
I shoulda done these writing songs, are going ninety wide
You think I'm talking about you, if the shoe fit wear it dog
You done pissed me off, this was the last straw
You whack producers who think, your tracks are the bomb
I thought you knew you need a platinum, wasn't a real song
I can go on and on, while all while sealing the flow
See all you niggas really need me, but you don't hear me though

[Hook - 2x]

(Billy Cook)
Yeah, hey yeeeeah
Trae help me out, Trae help me out
The Maab, yeeeeah BMG 1965
The click, the squad, help me out
Oooo-oooooh, weeeell

These niggas don't want none[Hook: Shyna]
Struggling, to live my life
Working hard, trying to get it right
Though it seems, it will never change
Help me God, make it through this rain
Struggling, to live my life
Working hard, trying to get it right
Though it seems, it will never change
Help me God, I can't take this pain

[Trae]
I ain't got no friends, but I got foes
I needed a gallon, only got hoes
See me and my niggas, shed tears for too long
Lost everything, and prayed to get gone
On the cool, it wasn't all about balling
Have you ever been left out, in the rain
Everyday all day, left stuck in the game
Not able to make a choice, and gotta feel the pain
Fell that can you relate, to the life I live
Nothing but thugs on blocks, one life to give
And I don't wanna reminisce, thinking of my life
Will get me pissed, and I'm knowing this
I got a big brother, living in the Penitentiary
Never will I see him again, in this century
And that's fucked up, cause I ain't get to see him that much
I be ready to quit, but then I love too much
On top of that, lost my nigga Screw-U
They all I got, and that's all I had
And I got a damn thang, that motivate Trae
Then they wanna know why, I be mad all day
Or I be sad all day, and sitting in my zone
And I ain't got no love, you better leave me alone
I'm known to get cold, deep inside my soul
Thinking of hard time bitch, fuck hoes and hoes
And piece and chain, and anything else that shine
A lot of that shit, don't really mean a damn thang
I don't do no drugs, I face everything head on
If you ain't ever felt how I feel, get the hell on
The other hand, I deserve to be heard
And everything I live, I can relate with skills
And these niggas wanna knock, cause I ain't on the radio
And everything I spit on the mic, be real

[Hook]

[Dougie D]
Take a look, at the thoughts inside my mind
The pain I feel, it burns so deep inside
It's a struggle everyday, to live my life
Mean a young a black male, at home or die
Just swallow my pride, and I'll take it
Keep on pumping, soon and I'll make it
Face to face, through all of this case shit
Slowly y'all, I've been losing my patience
Everyday that I live, is like I'm dying
But the main light, right look clock he trying
Looking through the hour glass, it's standard time
Love to stay strong, but the weak they gon survive
Don't need to beg, I just ask him
All the pain hurts less, it just pass me
Mo' and mo', I try to be happy
Haters, don't want to let that happen
Through the rain and the pain, I gotta deal with it
Keep my head tight, just to stay real with it
Hustle and grind, just to break bread in it
Pray to God, I don't get found dead in it
My time is my time, your time is your turn
All the bullshit I done faced, up in my life I done faced it
On, and no need for your words
Everyday that I move, I struggle and strive
Long as a nigga, strive the struggle and die
On my grind, for a time to feed my child
On a mission for feddy, to watch and multiply
This time around, a change gon come
All the while, you was thinking that it wouldn't
My sunny days, done turned to rain
But nevertheless, I'm still gon keep on pumping

[Hook]

[Trae]
Over the years, I'm running out of family
But it ain't nothing, but the man in me
I know I gotta be strong, and I can't let it handle me
I gotta ride, for my family
Hey Brenda, I'mma get that plack for you baby
And if not, I'mma die trying
And I put that on my life, I really wanna see Claire
But I don't, cause I can't stop crying
Lord, can you tell me what I did wrong
Why, everybody telling me to be strong
I don't wanna have to keep, doing these songs
Everybody need to leave me, the fuck alone
I'm sick, and I just can't take it
Running from the pain, I feel I can't shake it
I don't even wanna know, if I'mma make it
Nothing but hard times and hard rhymes, I gotta break it
Call me crazy, call me gone
Really, they don't wanna get off in my zone
Cause if I take the time, I put it in my life
A lot of niggas out here, be crying to go home
I'm still at the bottom, might make it to the top
And I know I can't stop, for my brother on lock
And my gal and my child, and everybody else I love
To death, before I'm signing out
I can't take it to heaven, but I continue right here
Everything I will, if your tape don't sell
Everybody and they mama, wanna see a nigga fail
Only time gon tell, of Trae gon prevail
And deep down, my life messing my head up
I'm fed up, and so ready to let up
I'm knocked down, and I don't wanna be getting up
Heavenly Father, help me 'fore I'm giving up

[Hook]

(Shyna)
I can't take this pain, I can't take this pain
I can't take this pain, I can't take this pain

No more pain, no more pain
No more pain, no more pain
No more pain, no more pain
No more pain, no more pain

(*singing*)[Fat Pat]
Niggas better see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on 84's

[Hook - repeat 4X]
Swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip

[Trae]
I'mma swang, I'mma swing my slab lean to the left
Pop my trunk and show what I'm about so Houston Texas got to be fit, I'm a vet
So it's automatic when I'm swinging my wide frame
4 4,s to 24's I'm subject to glide man
Like a pimp without the whip I'm still so fly when I slide man
Plus I'm lethal and fully loaded ain't no takin my ride man
We gangsta and it ain't to much you can do to stop us
Don't try to knock us cause these diamonds got boppas tryna jock us
We the best at what we gon be and these haters know it
So haters hate us to death and I know cause these haters show it
I only ride alone so they can picture me rollin
And for them jackers thinkin fly just picture what I be holdin
Them hollow points will make you picture just how fast they'll be foldin'
A few of them will have you leakin' til you're dead or you're swollen
But still I ride like the law, floatin above everything
I'm Screwed up Click until it's over nigga, fresh off the chain
Peep the slang

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
I'mma swang, and a swang, and a swang to the left
Pop my trunk for Fat Pat's death
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back a matter of fact bring the whole crew back
Only God can do that so I'mma leave it alone
Moving on moving 'til this sew gets on
I'm cruising along still got a screw tape on
Still in the zone wishing Corey Blount was home
Riding on chrome banging with my bud lights on
Riding home I reach Southern Astrodome
I’m Fat Pat’s clone, his legacy carries on
His heart beat pumps through my flesh and bone flippin with Trae
Rolling down MLK it's blue over gray
I'm chunkin seven duce today his dove k
Chiefin on some love lay and we on the boulevard acting ugly
We gon

[Hook]

[Trae]
They be heinous my type of nature, my understand to this bip
Stacks in the back on the lack of this glimpse funna see me strip
Cutting corners on the daily basis
We fast like Kanye West samples when I be changin faces
I'm low like tips of waiters when I lean to the left
I roll the cd through the door for the fifth, poppers and pimps
Or maybe in the Impala 67 Chevy be spinnin
Invisible samples play everytime they catching me grin
Off in they face ain't too much they can do to a G
But try to hate me every second due to the fact who I be
And it don't bother me cause I still chop in my game
Just don't come off the side to my range I might be leaving the stage
Within my slab I be niggas gon respect to be gangsta
Teach certain dickeys plus the kids to lay wusup for you wankstas
Everyday's still the same I be still loud when I bang
And thanks to Screw and P-A-T we got them digging my slang
Huh

[Hook] - 9X

Love it man, love it man, love it man...(*Fat Pat*)

Swang-swanging, sawnging swang two yeah

[Trae]
I'mma swang on my swangas, slab lean to the left
Pop my trunk and show what I'm about, so Houston Texas gotta be felt
I'm a vet, so it's automatic when I be swinging my wide frame
Fo' 4's to 24's, I'm subject to glide mayn
Like a pimp without the limp, but still so fly when I slide mayn
Plus I'm lethal fully loaded, ain't no taking my ride mayn
We gangsta, and it ain't too much, you can do to stop us
Don't try to knock us, cause they bounders got boppers trying to jock us
We the best at what we gon be, and these haters know it
So haters hate us to death, and I know cause these haters show it
I only ride alone, so they can picture me rolling
And for them jackers thinking fly, just picture what I be holding
Them hollow points'll make you picture, just how fast they'll be folding
A few of them'll have you leaking, till you dead or you swollen
But still I ride like the law, floating above everything
I'm Screwed Up Click until it's over, nigga fresh off the chain peep the slang

Pop my trunk, for Fat Pat's death
I would give my last breath, if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back, matter fact bring the whole crew back
Only God can do that, so I'mma leave it alone
Moving on, grooving to this soothing song
I'm cruising on, still got a Screw tape on
Still in the zone, wishing Corey Blunt was home
Riding on chrome, banging with my bub lights on
Riding home, Southeast of the Astro-dome
On Fat Pat's clone, his legacy carries on
His heartbeat, pumps through my flesh and bone
Flipping with Trae, mobbing down MLK
He's blue over grey, I'm tipping seven deuce today
It's Dub-K, chiefing on some lovely
And we on the Boulevard, acting ugly we gon

Swang-swanging, sawnging swang two yeah
Pop-pop my trunk, and lift-lift-lift

[Trae]
A.B.N. is my type of nature, my understanding is nothing
Stacks in the back of a Lac, on this glass you finna see me strutting
Cutting corners, on a daily basis
Move fast like Kanye West samples, when I be chasing faces
I'm known to tip like a waiter, when I be lean to the left
I roam the city through the dark, with a fifth on bumpers and belts
Or maybe in the Impala, '67 Cheve be spinning
Invisible set display, everytime they catching me grinning
Off in they face, and ain't too much that they can do to a G
But try to hate me every second, due to the fact who I be
And it don't bother me, cause I still be chopping my game
Just don't come off the side of my Range, I might be leaving a stain
Whether my slab or beam, niggas gon respect that we gangsta
T-shirt and dickies, plus the kicks that I lace up for you wankstas
Everyday is still the same, I be so loud when I bang
And thanks to Screw and P-A-T, we got 'em digging our slang huh

[Pimp C]
I'm a Screwed Up afilliated, strictly rolling red
Everytime we hit the parking lot, we turning heads
I've been watched by parole, task force 'em by the FED's
Cause they know I got 'em for ten, and they know the game ain't dead
It's too late I'm deep up in it, ain't nothing about me scary
Chiefing in the club, trying to find me something hairy
Pimping at the bar, smoking on a stogey
Since I came home from the Penn, seem like everybody know me
You got lot's of friends, when ya up and when ya balling
Just like Pookie, all the haters started on calling
They see the diamonds, and the Bentley and the candy thang
They know I'm mob style protected, they know I'm rolling with James
They know it's UGK for life, and that I'm down with Bun
They know we grind, and fin to hit 'em with another one
It's UGK records right now, we need distribution
Since Lori Redmond done freed the pimp, it's going down in Houston

I'm the king, I'm the mayor of the city - got the game locked down
I roll twelve cars, one with my top down
I be swangin in that candy, they don't understand me
Got my slab complete, watch me pull up on this brandy
I'm swangin in this slab with the peanut butter guts
If she hop inside my ride then the bitch know she gon'fuck
I ain't playin with no skeezer, the ho know I don't need her
I pull out my Visa to tease her, not please her
They see the diamonds shinin - hand on the wood wheel
Even though I sold a mill, streets got me hood still

[Verse 6 - Trae]
I still swang to the left, 84's sittin under Tha Truth
And these haters watchin my moves, from the way I butterflyed the Coupe
I'm black over alligator so niggas know that I got it
Trunk lift up at the light but my droppa remainin squated
Still bangin my Screw, doin my thing
See the sun been out on me, but they swear I been in the rain
My swangas poke out so wide like I'm ridin in double lanes

Well I'm a swang, I'm a swang, I'm a swang to the right

When I pull up at the light, at a quarter to midnight
You pull up right - scared to death, gotta call in the life flight
UGK is back on the slab and turnin the wheel
Once again the Bun and the Pimp, the return of the trill
You can love to hate us, or hate to love us - it ain't a thing
To them Underground Kingz, we still gon'swang

[Verse 9 - Paul Wall]
I put the H up in the air for that A dub K
That fifth wheel, bow down and pray I'm brandy wine over gray
I'm swangin with Trae, sprayed by my home boy Ed
That third coast custom paint job, got me lookin ready
That Swisha House around my neck - Johhny Dang on my wrist
Trunk bang like ABN with wood grain on my fist

Swangin and bangin on that Screw and throwin boys that duece, It's Paul Wall....

(I pray they take me back)
Pants standing up by themselves
(I pray they take me back)
Big ass nugget mothafuckin' earrings fake ass gold chains nigga fake
(I pray they take me back)
Mothafuckin golds in our mouths
(I pray they take me back)
We the coolest niggas on earth mane starter jackets, gummies, flat tops
(I pray they take me back)
Nigga remember all that shit mane couldn't tell me shit in my mothafuckin life
(I pray they take me back)
Late nights sweet talkin' on the mothafuckin phone
Thinkin we muhfuckin R&B stars an' shit
An' ya ass had to beat that curfew
Or ya ass was gettin an ass woopin nigga
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' bout them early days like "What the fuck I did with life?"
Funny how fast time'll past and make you pray to live it twice
Overalls and British knights
Spray painted the huffy bike
Just to ride the block like I'm the shit pull up on something nice
She was wearing daisy dukes finger weighs and hoopsins
Baskets from the grocery store just to shoot some hoops in
Corner store passing up them old niggas under the trees
Yelling out look out but I keep going its 90°
Hoping ain't no dogs loose
Might just have to switch routes
Plus I want my kool cup
She better not be sold out
Gun be lookin' wop sided, leanin' like its fallin over
Grease fallin on my shoulder
Still I feel cool like the polar

[Chorus]
(I pray they take me back)
I was playa though
(I pray they take me back)
Days like that made me who the fuck I am man
(I pray they take me back)
I remember mothafuckin me an' boss stepping out
(I pray they take me back)
Jay'ton ain't old enough to come out so he gotta stay at the crib
(I pray they take me back)
Madder than a mothafucka
(I pray they take me back)
Nigga used to pull up at the skating ring nigga
(I pray they take me back)
Nigga any mothafuckin broad we want nigga we gon' shoot on sight
(I pray they take me back)
Lord knows prolly ain't get them hoes anyway but fuck it
(Check it)

[Verse 2]
Doing things we had no business
Had me feeling like a menace
Hopping over gates and nigga knocking running like a scrimmage
Somewhere in and out my granny house she yelling close the door
Soon as she flip out and get that switch, oh shit its time to go
What youknow
Older brother on his way to juvenile
Jackin' cars begging them to ride but I was just a child
All I knew was a lot of laws, movies had us running wild
Gold tooth, open face, I wanted it just to smile
Couldn't get it hit beauty supply and got the fake instead
Pager on my waist and stolen candy tryna make some bread
Stole my partna daddy gun bet no one go'n take my shoes
All about respect I knew to make a move or stay confused

[Chorus]
(I pray they take me back)
I'm talmbout them stadium old days nigga
(I pray they take me back)
Round that time nigga nigga seen Menace to Society, Boyz 'n the Hood nigga
(I pray they take me back)
Err Thang dickie down nigga
(I pray they take me back)
You'd have thought we were biggest mothafuckin' gangstas in the city
(I pray they take me back)
I love that shit though mane
(I pray they take me back)
Them the mothafuckin' days man
(I pray they take me back)

[Outro]
I can't tell about all this new shit going on right now
But I remember what we had going back then
Remember them mothafuckin' Rolex banners
Young nigga diggin', you knew him, crazy lil' mothafucker though
Motherfuckin' brother nigga, I ain't forgettin' this shit
Mf brother i ain't forgot this shit[Intro: Trae tha Truth]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Quentin talk to 'em

[Pre-Hook: Quentin Miller]
Yeah, turn up like they can't do, go up like they can't do
Yeah, one three one seven and Trae tha Truth
My whip is the latest, but they want my latest
We on Kelly Slater, let's wave-o, let's wave-o, let's wave-o
Oooh

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Nobody did us no favors
You fuckin' with takers, you fuckin' with takers
We see what we want and we take it
You talkin' to a taker

[Bridge: Quentin Miller]
Walked in to your function, it's bottles at the table
I might stand on the table, if I break it I can pay for it
I buy my daughter Jordans, just to go to daycare
We really beat the pavement, we don't ask we take shit

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm straight outta Houston the whip i got ridin' screw
Back of it bangin' like something it's red or blue
Don't talk to me nigga, if I do not talk to you
My bitch got a bitch so I might just get head or two
Band after band I can show you just what to do
Symptoms of the flu if Truth end up next to you
Yeah bitch I'm clean if I'm you I'll be hating too
I don't get service, no calling
I'm back to back like Miami, I'm balling
I rep Texas in a foreign, so often
Tell 'em hoes no, cause my ceiling keep falling
Me and my G, hit the club it's on me
Fuck a section buy the whole V.I.P
Fuck your money, it ain't nothing to me
Truth getting outta traffic like my name goalie
Goal and shooting at your bitch, I never aim wrong
When I'm legal, I collect them like a payphone
And when I finish hit the uber, only way home
Ain't no point of calling me your time has expired
Nigga I'm a pimp get a bunny tell her she high
She ain't getting rack after rack tell her she fine
Baby I'm the streets, every corner how I required

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Nobody did us no favors
You fuckin' with takers, you fuckin' with takers
We see what we want and we take it
You talkin' to a taker

[Bridge 2: Trae tha Truth]
I might just ride the chopper
Or I'mma sing to ya like the opera
All white, Cindy Lauper
Jumpman on my hopper
Bowlegged as if I clock ya
Somebody better stop ya
Fuck niggas I'm a watcha
Hundred bands in the locker

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Nobody did us no favors
You fuckin' with takers, you fuckin' with takers
We see what we want and we take it
You talkin' to a taker

[Outro: Trae tha Truth]
Did us no favors nigga
You fuckin' with takers
We take it, we take it, we take it, we take it, we take it
Yeah[Trae]
It be the same situation, round this motherfucker
Niggas hate ya for what you got, and trying to keep it undercover
It's a dirty game, so I gotta play it how it go
And even niggas from your frontline, learn to hate behind a hoe
Even niggas from my set, don't even wanna see me breathing
But I swear if I get test, somebody family gon be grieving
Yeah and still I'm never tripping, shit be going through my mind
I let my mind override my anger, so I don't get hit with time
But I guess I'm doing fine, niggas know who got the throne
Fuck the industry, and I advise them fake ass niggas leave me alone
So I click first, I won't let em take me out my zone
They don't know shit, they's rather hear Flip or Mike Jones
Disrespected yep, everytime I spit my lines
One of the hardest motherfuckers, when I spit my lines
A Asshole, but I use to be a cool lil' nigga
Until my nigga's smile, turned to a frown behind my figgas
I won't let it come to triggers, I remember everything
We use to ride or die together, now I'm stuck feeling the pain
But I learned to maintain, and operate from a distance
Don't get it twisted, if you need me I'll be there in an instance
Ms. Danielle, I really hate you turned out to be fake
Fucking with these ol' roach ass niggas, to be your mate
Just wait, and watch how fast this nigga Trae rise
I know you sick, cause I can see it in your eyes

[Hook Trae & Dallas - 2x]
Y'all, should of knooooown
I'ma take, my throooone

[Trae]
What the bidness is, everybody act like I owe em some'ing
Keep fucking up my mood, it's garunteed I will show em some'ing
I heard I got a price on my head, in ATX
Ronnie Joe, just know that if someone get touched you gon be next
And you can take it as a threat, or you can leave it where it's at
Cause if you come at me again, you or something gon get a tech
My tolerance kinda low, and that explains my attitude
The only one that get respect is my mama, cause she will lend the gratitude
Tell me father can you help me, cause my vision is blury
It's like these niggas know my status, so they rush in a flury
It's hard to tell what's in they heart, so I don't even give it time
I remember '99, some of you niggas wasn't down
And the rap game the same, it depends who hot
These niggas'll cut ya, it just depends how fast you flop
So fuck a feature, and I don't give a fuck about collabbing
Only loyalty I got, is from the ruger that I'm grabbing
Fuck how you niggas feel, bout skills
Cause ninety-nine point nine percent of you niggas, don't even keep it real
Worried about, if a nigga gon outshine they ass
Ask me if been to give it, cause they sound like trash
Oh if I mark my words, if I ain't dead by now
These niggas pussy, and I'm bout to lose my head right now
And on the cool, you can only imagaine if niggas true
Read they eyes in conversation, and watch what them niggas do

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Me and my motherfucking team, we gon take the throne nigga
We don't need no motherfucker, to give it to us
We gon earn that we gon take that nigga, and a fight go with that nigga
Y'all know y'all ain't seeing us nigga, we been doing this shit since '97 nigga
For deep, we ain't never dropped nothing whack nigga
Always drop, motherfucking ghetto classics nigga
Always kept the hood on fire, remember that nigga
Better check your motherfucking background, stats ain't changed nigga
This the Asshole By Nature, Slow Loud And Bangin'
Screwed Up motherfucking Click
The same motherfucker from Guerilla Maab, feel what I'm saying
That's who I be nigga, Trae ain't shit changed motherfucker[Hook (2x): samples "Be Careful" by Sparkle]
Tear down the walls in this house*
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house

[Verse 1:]
I remember dreaming like a king but misery had did no fucked up
Pain turned into fame and had me looking like I looked up
Cherishing every moment time running so far away
Instead of looking for hope I take hate and call it a day
I feel it in the air, tension crowding up my atmosphere
I take it as it is it ain't no happy feelings passing here
It's hard to say who love me money got the picture frame it
You can't explain going through shit when people think you made it
Everybody got opinions they don't know what's going on
I tell em leave me in that zone and end with fuck alone
I'm feeling trapped inside my home the pressure got me nervous
Praying like a deeking at a church still ain't been to service
And I feel like this attention left my baby momma with a grudge
I give my kids the world so why the fuck I'm stuck in front this judge
I try patience but it's hard to use it round this motherfucker
Somebody help me 'fore I lose it round this motherfucker

[Hook: x2]
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house

[Verse 2:]
I'm less than a minute away
Going upside this wall with either my head and my hand
I [?] myself to live for what I love I'm watching it sink in sand
I feel that down so much the anger got me like I'm trippin'
It's hard to be a stand-up nigga when ya life is slippin'
Sometimes I wish to bring my partna's back up out the round
Instead of me crying out through this pain and letting it out the sound
I'm on my own cause when I look for help it's not around
They say they only wait but end them off like they was out of town
My homeless faking any breath of air to snuck about it
I need to bin before I take these wall the fuck up out it
I'm burn this bitch up for I let it hurt me any longer
Shit got me rough as hell I doubt it make me any stronger
The only piece of mind I get is looking at my ceilings
Sometimes it ain't nothing other days it's a wonderful feeling
I close my eyes and end up headed where they say it's danger
I rather be there cause here is nothing but familiar strangers

[Hook: x2]
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house
Tear down the walls in this house... [until fades out]          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        [Hook: Meek Mill]
They tryna tell me that I can’t when I know I can
You knock me down, I get up, we gonna go again
Every time them haters see my face like "here we go again"
Cause to the day they take me out, I be going in
Yeah I’ma ride to the motherfucking finish
Because the sky is the motherfucking limit
And I’m on it, I’m on it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, they try to assassinate, limitate, intimidate
Lock me down at jay way, and gave me a December day
One thing bout my mama, she made sure I had that dinner plate
Scar me when they killed my dad
I was wild like Simba
Remember they, left me there for dead, I ain’t care
I went harder than they did, and went farther than they did
Tell me I can’t just like they did, I’m a grown man about my bizz
I go hard to get what I want, chasing my dreams like Forest Gump
Dreamchaser, but I ain’t going to sleep
24 a day, 7 days a week
48 weeks a year, I ain’t sleeping yeah
Cause I ain’t tryina take no shorts, like the leaping year
Cops try lock me, niggas try leave me there
Road to the riches, homie you should meet me there
Crab in the bow, haters tryina keep me there
But watch me break away, yeah I’ma make a way

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I remember they said I wouldn’t, shit
Told them bitches take it back
Fuck niggas got famous, I waited my time to place the bet
They knew I was coming for it
Fuck your fine make a bet
Everything was dealer, hopping out of something draped in black
Swear the go is something goes sicker, they getting shook
Standing so well over haters, like shut the fuck up and look
They can’t stop a nigga campaign, tell them I’ve been elected
Then it’s robbing on you bitches, I’m playing till I’m ejected
Pussy niggas keep talking, tell them to take a breath
I’ma be here, many using every second left
A bunch of niggas playing fowl, that’s without a ref
You knock me down I’ma keep fighting with you till the death
I made it out the dark now I’m somewhere in the light
The way I’m focus turned a couple niggas syphe
Tell them look at me now, they told me I couldn’t make it
Now I’m king of the streets, I dare your ass to try and take it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, man I was 16 with big dreams
Coming from a small hood
Homie thirsty, standing on the corner, like it’s all good
Go hard just to feed the team
Make sure that we all good
Niggas maine we stand up they the niggas I’m gonna fall for
All aboard, taking off, once in these taking loss
Telling me I can’t when I can, why you hating, dub?
Faith you try to grab ho, back tinted shake it all
Anything to reach the top, loosing friends and breaking routes
I was born to loose but I was built to win
Before Charlie Macking tip, I was going in
Before the radio, I was gonna have it all
I was in the cell, waiting on the day they’d let me go
Yeah I was playing around, why you wanna play me now
Somebody wanna say somethin’ , you should say it now
To all my haters though, swear I won’t let them down
You know somebody that go hard
Then you should get ‘em now

[Hook][Trae]
Somebody help him that boy ain't tripping, he really misunderstood
Addicted to doing bad, but he trying to get out the hood
Life as an adolescent, got him stressing back in the day
Now he paranoid, ducking and dodging to get away
You would think a hard life, is what he prayed to have
Everytime he reached out for love, there was nobody he could grab
That's why he was cold inside, he took his pain as strive
With a 4-5, minus one to stay alive
A ghetto baby is what he was, his uncle was doing drugs
And left him to be a thug, on the corner with nigga slugs
His brother was locked up, and mama was stressed out
He was a good kid, until reality turned him out
20 years old, on the way to becoming a man
Live in another world, people would never understand
Loving to be alone, feeling like he would meet the end
The good life, was never part of the plan

[Hook]
Let me tell you a story, bout a dude I know
With so much pain in his heart, it wouldn't show
And he never knew when his life, was gon go
Everytime he'd step out, he grabbed the fo'-fo'
Let me tell you a story, bout a dude I know
With so much pain in his heart, it wouldn't show
Everybody he knew, was living so shife
But he kept on moving, trying to live life

[Trae]
Now he running the block
With a pocket full of rocks, missing FED time
And watching hating niggas, so he don't wind up with dead time
Cause everything he got, that nigga rightfully earned
Get in his way behind his paper, he was subject to leave you burned
Plus he running with a click of guerillas, that's living shife
And hated life, the only way out was to pay the price
He was ready for whatever, decisions he made his own
And since they pissed him off, he would prolly be moving alone
Doing his own thang, to hell with the consequences
Real ran through his blood, and them niggas payed attention
He wanted to get it together, but it was prolly too late
He took the wrong turn, and that's what decided his fate
It wasn't his fault, but that's how the game done got him
Swallowed him up and left him, to be on the rock bottom
Without no say-so, a victim of circumstance
Put in a situation, begging for a hand

[Hook]

[Trae]
Nowhere to turn nowhere to go, so he contemplate suicide
Mentally out of line, needing help but he got pride
He got a child on the way, but his baby mama don't want him
Cause he broke without a job, and probation be leaning on him
Three strikes, and he heated to live in the penitentiary
Believe me it get lonely, to niggas without a family
He might get lost to the system, or might get shanked in a bed
The thought of calling it quits, gotta be running through his head
He don't know what to do, he praying he in a dream
Waking up in a cold sweat, to be shaking it like a fiend
But he can't get away, so he be running out his mind
People looking for him, so he know he running out of time
One of three things can happen, he can run or wind up dead
Or go out on his own, with a 44 to the head
No one ever really knew, cause ain't nobody seen him since
He disappeared in the night, with no evidence

[Hook - 2x]

[Hook]?That's for real (8x)*

[Verse 1:]
Another day drama got me going through it eyes fighting me to open
Dreaming the way the struggle knowing everything is broken
Pain sweat and tears let me soaking
Now I'm feeling like I'm losing on some shit that got me contemplating smoking
Inhaling off the light looking at these haters like I owe em
Pressing something like a bomb ten seconds from try'na blow em
Never turn another cheek, pride goin make a nigga show em
Niggas got something to say now it's fuck em like I don't know em
All I ever tried to do was make a way for me and grind
It ain't been anything less for a decent amount of time
Extra time to searching for a position they couldn't find
They disregard being loyal like it's something they left behind
Homie you goin do your thang I'm goin do mine
Keep ya rather distance for the shit I'm packing two crimes
Niggas say it was love but now I see the love they had lay in a hersh
It safe to say they love for hate focus to see me doing worse

[Chorus:]
When hard times seem to find you (that's for real)
When niggas find yourself behind you (that's for real)
When in the days barely find you (that's for real)
And all you know is how to make it through (that's for real)
If you broke shit straight then ya making love money
Errbody wanna say they ain't changed
But every motherfucker thank every other motherfucker
Goin knock em I think position in the game

[Verse 2:]
I hate to say to believing in niggas got me disappointed more than ever
How the fuck they something real knowing they lie about whatever
They do know about loyalty all they know about is cheddar
All they hate was tuck away till they thought I was doing better
But I still hold it together with no one what I had been through
Everything I'm about enough to show I never been you
Disrespecting your homie it's something I don't get into
Being real ain't nothing practice in something already in you
Dawg told me watch at a distance load up and fall back
Soon as they show they colours expose em and never call back
Never forget the way that they done ya remember all that
Other than definition of pussy is where they falling
And if so they playa hide layout
They know I'm where the streets at, you other niggas not me so stay out
They pray my enemies take out the truth for what I spoken
I see the snakes no longer in the grass they in the open

[Chorus: x2]
When hard times seem to find you (that's for real)
When niggas find yourself behind you (that's for real)
When in the days barely find you (that's for real)
And all you know is how to make it through (that's for real)
If you broke shit straight then ya making love money
Errbody wanna say they ain't changed
But every motherfucker thank every other motherfucker
Goin knock em I think position in the game
Is it real? [x7][Hook]
That’s not love
That’s not love
That’s not love
Not real true love

[Verse 1 - Trae]
Chea, I woke up this morning feeling the world forgot about me
But then I remembered I’m the streets, it ain’t no life without me
Now what they really know about me? other than the fact I’m a asshole
And it’s death for any bitch tryna take it up out me
I’m in the game so tell them niggers I’mma leave with somethin’
I’m half an hour pass my patience, bitch I’m needing some
I eat niggers up like they dinner, digest ‘em and shit ‘em out
And re-direct them to the classes of a new beginner
They say I never cheer (why), I don’t associate myself with other packs of gorillas
That see that they miss the real
So understand before I loose, I swear to leave ‘em sicker than

When they heard the news, that ain’t love, damn

[Hook & (Lil Wayne)]
That’s not love
That’s not love (yeahhh, ay Trae I got you)
That’s not love (and I’m still poured up baby)
Not real true love (just pray for me sweetheart, yeah)

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Snakes in the grass, so I stay on the pavement
Survived the battle when Adam was a cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die?
The answer’s right under your nose
And in the game I don’t sleep, in the game I don’t cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I just gon’ wipe the dishes till they spot-free
Trae you can count on me like 1, 2, 3
Keep my business in my pocket, never wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
If that ain’t love

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Trae]
They been questioning if this real, well bitch I’m here to answer
I’m on that shit that hit your life in last stages of cancer
A couple decades of head is what your mind is on
There ain’t no keeping up with me, I’m in a different time zone
If I don’t rap, I’mma trap, if I don’t trap, I’mma slap the clip in F8
And get like Busta Rhymes and make it clap
Yeah they told you I’m gangster, fuck what you talking about
Ain’t no rapper gon’ have your body, see your spirit walking out
I’m so Houston homie, AB and speak for itself
When I speak, please shut the fuck up cause I ain’t speaking for him
Uh, they saying Trae back in that zone
Tell them motherfuckers they weren’t wrong
Nigga fuck love, shit

[Hook][Trae]
Can I get a moment of silence for all my niggas in the streets no longer livin
Or they headed through them gates to (?) there life in prison forgotton
I feel they pain so now I'm ridin for the situation
My heart goes out to all the T Jones who live impatient
Cause some of us blessed-and some of us ain't
Some of us takin shit for granted never stoppin to think
I got four handful of my niggas doin biz
Not a thought of comin home what the fuck about they kids
I know I can't be they Daddy but I feel like I can teach 'em
Yeah I know I'm only one but I'll be damn if I don't reach 'em
So I'm still here tryna understand why the hell bein poor will get you stoned
My nigga Reggie just did eight flat half of his life is gone
And I'm glad he made it home but see he back without my brother
Ain't a day that fly away that I don't think about my brother
He went in when I was thirteen but now I'm twenty four
Everyday I sit and hope that they will free him before it's time to go

[Chorus: Dallas + Shyna]
This can't be life Lord please tell me why
Why should I try to stay in and fight
And these streets ain't my home
And these niggas are so wrong
I want so much more before I reach the other side

[Trae]
I got my mug on cause every minute I get caught up in a thug zone
I don't wanna get put up like I'm Pac inside this slug zone
I'm tryna be a better man
See too many soliders die and get acquainted with the sand
I don't hate the world we live in I hate the way it treat us
I know we here to serve a purpose but the devil he will cheat us
Just like my nigga Robert Davis who was destined for the ground
And he passed away a living legend king of underground
And I miss him just like alot of y'all missin y'all niggas
Hard times come a mile a minute even for guerilla's
Everytime the rain fall out the sky somebody leavin
Everytime you see the white chalk you know somebody grievin
It's as simple as that life ain't always for the best
Half of us don't even know if we gon end up put to rest
For the night fall and can't nobody see it comin
I tip my hat to them niggas livin life and steadily runnin (keep on runnin)

[Chorus] - repeat to endIntro]
Yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, it's my life

[Verse 1-Trae]
Dammit I did it again (ah)
Dammit back at it again (yah)
Kill the game part 2 (yah)
Sit back watch me elevate
Fuck the rules I’m a renegade
Apparel on point (point)
Rollie wrist on point(point)
Whole squad on point (yah)
At the top of the pinnacle
Looking down like I'm God's eye
While y’all fuckers getting critical(ah)
I'm busy flying sky high(high)
My dreams 'fore my eyes(eyes)
Story of my life(life)
Live fast' fore I die
Live 'fore I die
Wait, wait, wait (yah)
If you listen to em all you'll do is wait
Why
Wait, wait, wait(yeah)
When you can do it now
So go on get your cake
So I met this fire mama
I'm like can I get your number(ah huh)
Then she like Ok
Buh I gotta see your wallet
Show her croc skin
Next thing wake up at her apartment
Just another night when you live the way you want it

[Chorus]
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, it's my life

Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, it’s my life

[Verse 2 - Zizi BluCheddah]

Waving my hair like I’m Booga T
I just drank on Red Bull
Now I got all the energy
You still sipping on ice tea
Going at it like an addict
Silly like Dennis the Menace
Gimme, gimme
I ain't got no menace
Imma stab like a porcupine
Going disco with flashlight
Going schitzo with coocoo mind
Going fast like Sonic the Hedgehog
I’m a big dog with a big clock like tic toc
I'm a big dog with a big clock like tic toc
If you ever disrespect my nigga
The gang gon' pull up
We gon pull the trigger
Give me respect like the Prime Minister
I can detect
Call me psychic
They can come second
Like my sidekick
Niggas be acting like me in town
But I still be looking doper than them in my gown
Ain't no stopping when I’m coming for the crown
I don't care if you front
I'm viral
I keep spinning and spinning
Like a spiral
I'm infectious
If I have it, your girl has it
Here, here don't panic
You might break
Steven Seagal with fast moves
Sippin' on cigars with the big pulls
She rubbing on me like masseuse
She looking yellow with the juice
My side is better than your main
Me and my niggas need a place
To stay
Like a palace
Zizi BluCheddah with the flow
And my nigga Trae with the flow
Zizi BluCheddah with the flow
And my nigga Trae with the flow
Zizi BluCheddah with the flow
And my nigga Trae with the flow
Flow flow flow

[Chorus]
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, it's my life

Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, yayo
Wait, yah, ey, It's my life[Trae / Wycelf Jean:]
(Tell them the truth, the truth)*
I had too
You know as I sit here
Just me and this guitar playing
(Tell them the truth, the truth)
I feel the need to spazz out for a minute

[Verse 1:]
I'm on this pen and pad prize so I'm far away
Going to a change but unable to take my scars away
I speak the truth please expected I'm bout to go in
Father forgive me for the storm as I bout to begin
I look at those I thought was friends only shaking my head
Disappointed they ain't stayed real without them being scared
But then I find myself knowing I can't put faith inside of nothing but the homie above
(Nothing but the homie above)
But what's crazy I ain't never ask him for nothing but supporting so they hold me some love
(Supporting so they hold me some love)
People askin whether support for other Houston rappers
I tell em nowhere and truthfully it ain't a factor
It's too the point when I'm around they act like they don't see me
But I'm the streets and everything that cross it gotta see me
Instead of standing for the truth they worried bout getting they records played
Knowing nothing guarantee or make record stays
Was kinda funny niggas know I'm getting fucked over
But they act like they don't see nothing so quit to roll the fuck over
97.9 feel I should be banned for life
But I'm a fighter for my city I'm a stand for life
This is my land for life this Houston till the death of Trae
I still remain a fighter place for those who left away
They say the music that I'm make is getting people killed
How the fuck is that my music showing what was real

[Hook x2: Wycelf Jean]
The radio won't play this
They call it rebel music
How can you abuse it?
Children are mosaic

[Verse 2: Trae]
I'm in the community daily just to feel they pain
And show em when they under pressure how to fight the rain
And if I'm guilty for that then fuck it I deserve it
Tell em goin and shoot the ceilings tell me I'm a servant
Bad for radio because the power of my words
They hope that one day they see me fly away like the birds
They wanna do me like they did the cracker nuts and Brandy
But you can't fire me from Houston see they understand me
I told em with or without the lawsuit I'm here to fight
I ain't goin fall for anything I'm here for what was right
My music still gonna be filled after I'm long away
That probly why so many might just throw this song away

[Hook x4: Wycelf Jean]
The radio won't play this
They call it rebel music
How can you abuse it?
Children are mosaic
Tell them the truth, the truth
Tell them the truth, the truth
Tell them the truth, the truth(*Shyna*)
Cause, it's all I knoooow

[Trae]
I wish this life'd get better, but everyday it's like I'm wishing for nothing
But still I'm walking like I'm proud, and keep it G when I'm strutting
It's been a long road, watching everything unfold
I'm 24 and still alive, so I respect what I'm told
Some days I wonder who might go through, what I go through
Where every other day, some motherfucker think they know you
Come here nigga let me show you, that money don't change a thang
The only thing that change, is how quick your partnas'll bust your brain
I'm so use to seeing it rain, I give a fuck about the sunshine
I'm adapted to pain, that's why they feel it when I spit mine
It's anger when I spit lines, I remember what it was and where I'm coming from
I started from nothing, that's why I'm glad I made it out the slums
But that ain't do nothing, but change a nigga address
Same old drama same bullshit, same old stress
I'm well acquainted with the rain, so way too much that I ain't seen
Yeah I'm still below the possible, it's fuck you when I'm dreaming

[Hook: Shyna & (Dallas)]
See I would rather, feel the rain
Cause shit, don't ever change
(cause shit don't ever change)
So I kick it, with the rain
(so I'll just kick it, see I'll just kick it with the rain)
And try the best, to do my thang
(and try my best, and try my best)
Cause it's all I knoooow

[Trae]
It's like I keep feeling the pressure frustrated and agg'd, but trying to keep focus
Is hell, when pain collide with the rain haven't you noticed
I had a few up's in my life, and a whole bunch of them down's
It's amazing, how our niggas still around
Nevetheless I find myself, doing the same thang
Drop another album for the block, and try to get my change
And deep beneath that all I feel, like it's the last that I'm giving
While on this trip, you see my hurt no longer keeping me driven
I don't even feel part of nothing, it's been that way from the get
One of the realest, but I still end up the last round draft pick
I thought it was coming, a twenty thousand dollar video
BET denied it, cause unlike...it wasn't bout the hoes
And I ain't capping, I'm just keeping it real
It's prolly cause I don't be rapping, I be keeping it real
I won't sell my soul for no dollar, the money cars or fame
I won't even give it thought, I would rather kick it with the rain motherfucker

[Hook]

[Trae]
It ain't too many can relate, to what I'm feeling inside
I've been a loner on my own, so I continue to ride
Whether my life done been sour, I still been playing my part
No matter what these niggas say, don't try to take it to heart
I found myself in that situation, too many of times
And start to searching for myself, but anger's all that I find
I'm motivated by the doubt, that they done gained for a nigga
And all this way below the belt shit, that they aim at a nigga
But still I learn to continue on, to the next episode
No matter the weight up on my shoulders, I'll be damned if I fold
And even though, I'd rather find myself inside of the rain
It's only cause I see the fake, when I'm outside of the rain
And I ain't speaking on all, but yeah I'm speaking on most
This show right here, is when you keep it real and Trae is the host
If you ain't never been inside it, ain't no way to explain
The only thing that understand me, is the drops of the rain

[Hook]

[Shyna]
I'd rather feel the rain, (I'd rather feel the rain)
Cause shit don't ever change, (cause shit don't change)
So I kick it with the rain, (I kick it with the rain)
And try my best to do my thang, cause it's all I knoooow(*talking*)
Shit a trip mayn, ery'body want you to be all thefuck they want you to be
Nigga need to understand man, this shit the same nigga
We doing shit what's best for us right now, know I'm saying
We can't be out here, living for everybody else
Gotta do you, that's just what that is man
We grind and bust our ass man, to eat ten plus
Know I'm saying, since a nigga was twelve years old
24 now, you do the math I'm proud of everything a nigga done

[Trae]
How the fuck they say I don't show up no mo', like I ain't the nigga that put that street shit back on
Motivation for niggas to grind, and get they pack on
Been struggling since a teen and I don't wanna back track, plus I love my mama's smile
Heavenly father watch over my days, and bless your child
Half the time I wanna do my best to try, do my best not to cry do my best not to lie
But do the time I did, my best to get by while life went by
I'm not so young no mo', barely grown but everything that I do count
I'm still the same but running with caution, cause I don't wanna get took out
1999 I started the life, of showing you all of my pain
Did it for what it was worth, but now these haters keep on calling my name
Already done showed me love, but since they don't gorillas be quick to click
Quick to draw the line on certain shit, these niggas unable to fix
So I'm alone, trying to get this scratch before I be kicking it up the way with Pat
Watching my hood go round and round, but some of this shit ain't coming back
I watch the game observed, everything I need to see
The world is what it is from here on back, how it use to be

[Boss]
I try to keep it copestetic, when it could be all to the G
I'm in the coupe hiding extra clips, banging "All Eyez on Me"
Cause I don't want these coward niggas, to try to ride on me
I dropped the back right and lift the left front, and then glide on three
And slide on by to my hide away, gotta keep watching my high today
The laws pulled up two deep, they tried to run doubles on my ride today
I put my pride to seat, cause I gotta stack my change
And keep these bitches off my dick, and get these roaches out of my range
Ain't gon mention no names, fuck around and make a nigga have to put six in your brain
Your body will drip to the drain, fuck with us feel it slip and stain
I keep on dipping corners, where the G's be at
When you get deep it's sick in the B your B's up, cause these niggas here will squeeze gats
52 unlimited B's, I'm shaking these fleas and grizzats
Ahead of the pizzack, me and my niggas stay strizzapped with a mizzack
Gotta get ride of the sizzack where the clips at, for five of the mishap
Anybody killers are back with a brand new hit sack, it's like that

[Trae]
Straight up I gotta be a G to the fact, these niggas don't know what's thorough
And the fact they love to play, is really what's keeping me off of payroll
I conversated with my cousin, for the first time in a while
Let him know shit just ain't that bad, my mind fell off in a zone to raise my child up
Still the same nigga though I'm drifting off, trying to stay at my best
Even if they get me hold your head, you gon be blessed I'm moving honest
I'ma continue to ride, through the life is making me out of a man
I gotta be strong and plant my feet above the sand, that's the plan
They told me Trae that shit ain't you, in fact me I probably would of been leaving
And plus I would of let off the shots, to try to make them niggas bleed
You tried to fuck over me and Jay'Ton, ain't feeling me taking it back
Right is right and wrong is wrong, but haters be taking me off of my track
And I ain't gon be no bitch, ready to get my city you can get swallowed
Plus these scary niggas pack some'ing, that's fully equipped with something hollow
Dream is gon be soon to follow, trying to make his daily rounds
But I'll be damned if I make the pit, cause A.B.N. won't let me down[Intro]
You are now listening to The Tonite Show with Trae tha Truth and The Worlds Freshest[Trae]
This gon be the realest shit I ever wrote, so just know it's deeper than rap
It was a lot of shit that go, but now I'm bringing it back
I been a G all of my life, and tried to hold it for the best
I'm the realest nigga living, they can write it when I rest
Fuck it put me with the best, and I can stand out on my own
It's survival of the truth, and I'll be coming for the throne
Fuck being a bigger man, niggas played the game wrong
So I played it how they played it, while remaining in my zone
These niggas hoes, that's why they keep my name in they mouth
It ain't hard to find me, bitch nigga I'm the streets of the South
And ain't no banging over wax, nigga come see me in the hood
In the section where fake is twisted, like the W in wood
I been repping since I was 12, but now I'm 25 strong
With the family of A.B.N., running and toting some'ing chrome
I never trained to be in battle, even though I been at war
Mob made motherfucker, prolly leave you with a scar I'm the truth

[Hook: Billy Cook]
This be the realest, the realest shit I ever wrote
This be the realest, the realest shit I ever spoke
All I know is, (this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote)
All I know is, that I'm gon be the truth

[Trae]
They better know I peep everything in the game, they got me looking at my life different
Niggas out here thinking they can know it, if my vibe different
These other niggas out here falsified, telling lies
Sell a couple records, now they profitized keep it real
You niggas ain't got the credibility, to be the truth
Unless you out here living what you talking, in the booth
Everyday it be the same, niggas know I'm in the lane
Only fucking with the killers, cause we feel eachother pain
I hit the highway with my niggas, never toching the caine
Now they got me watching for the FEDs, bitches mention my name
Since I'm the leader of the gang, it make it hard for me to move
I'm the truth, it ain't gon be a pretty sight for me to lose
Trae bail on street shit, got it on a lock
Everytime I'm going off, niggas done got it on the block
Never something that it's not, I only know of being Trae
And that's the truth every motherfucking day, it ain't no other way

[Hook]

[Trae]
Niggas saying I got the name to be the truth, and I ain't even mad at em
But that expression on they face, had me taking jabs at em
This a warning shot, ever seen a nigga at his last
If you haven't, I advise you let this motherfucker pass
I ain't here to be mistaken, so respect it when I spit it
Fuck it keep it yourself, cause anyone of you's will get it
I'm a Asshole, and it's self explained by the anger
And I'm holding on a Glock, that's keeping one up in the chamber
I'ma strut it like a gangsta, so my niggas get they bang on
Hopping out the slab, Dickies sagging with my chains on
Hopping fly, cause they seen the dropper with them thangs on
Lord knows, Trae'll leave them niggas with they brains blown
I'm in another zone, niggas still on cloud nine
And I'm a loner, you niggas don't need to crowd mine
Trae the Truth is what it is, niggas know it's time
Plus I'm here to make em lay it down, 'fore I spray it down

[Billy Cook]
The truth be the realest shit I ever spoke, be the realest shit I ever wrote
(this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote)
Be the realest shit I ever spoke, be the realest shit I ever wrote - 2X

[Trae]
This be the realest shit, I ever spoke
Even if they never see it, this gon be the realest shit I ever wrote
Pay attention, to the shit I quote
Even if they never hear it, this gon be the realest shit I ever spoke - 2X

(*Billy Cook*)
One hundred percent real, one hundred percent reeeeeal
Heeeey, Trae let em know ooooh
This be the realest shit, that I ever spoke and wrote
This is the truth, heeeey[Hook]

Yea I don’t trust hoes, bitches hot as the summer
Anytime time I walk into something they on my bumper
They can find me in the club suiting jumpers
Then I’m all time high I’m doing numbers
Hoes trying to fix my pipe like a mechanic
Told her she going to get no place you couldn't stand it
Standing got me somewhere mars I’m off planet
Jumping out the whip so hot you couldn't feel it
Bitches ain’t shit that’s your mammas
Money in the safe bank account all commas
Everything froze these diamonds Obama's
Keep hoes all on the chord no honor

Uh pull up stunt truck me in the front

30 days on the road a million a month
Rolling up on the plane
Everywhere I go they know my name
You heard the song fuck her and sing
Tell them pass me the ball I better score
I’m all over the game
Your bitch mad you call her up her name
I pull my car up I don’t need no key
I just push a button and it start up
That’s tailored game no ordinary problems
I got rich ones
When it comes to those dollars I got big funds
I see they go stronger when it come on to the thirsties
I stay ducking and dodging

Blow through one-fifty, that's without the cap
And broke my attention, that'll get you slapped
Everything go so guess I'm tryna surf
Got your bitch watchin', guessin' what I'm worth
Know if she hop in here she getting work
I tell her go'n and take it like a perc
Asshole, I don't go
Dip my chain in this snow
Bet my name you don't know
Aim and shoot 'til I score
Have the whole hood on go
Everything Big like Mo
H-Town, everything slow
I don't make shit I can't blow
Somethin' exotic I got from Dubai
Whip Panameric to vision the sky
They say I'm not 'bout it, I tell 'em to try
But tha Truth get it poppin' like fourth of July
Fuck is you watchin', I'm fire like flames

Nigga pull up on me, I hop out, let it rain

Mauri gator got measles
Ready like werewolf
I can be a soo woo creature
I don't do phones, got beepers
I don't ride in cars, can't bleep us
New tattoo say, "Free Meech"
Show me how to treat this cougar

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Balmain, Jimmy Choo shoes
Come here and pay my dues
Never send the bitch no nudes
Shawty wanna fuck my dude (Can't fuck my dude)
I went broke, can't lose
I pay the Jag, no news
Paid a couple bands for her boobs
Five thousand chains for the crew
I'm out the coupe
I'm 'bout to shoot
Wanna see a rich nigga from the gutter
I'm the proof (I am facts)
I cut my bread up with no butter, who are you?
I'm YSL, I'm filthy rich and so are you
I'll never cross my guys, no no
I'll never cross my guys, ayy (never, never, yeah)
I'm tellin' the truth, ain't nothin' disguised
Five thousand dollars, I'ma go'n Xzibit my ride, ayy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Get my jewels up
Live like Jesus
Ice on me like
I got a fever
We trained to take from 'em
'Cause they wouldn't feed us
Now I got M&M's
'Round my visa
Feed the bitch pizza
Mauri gator got measles
Ready like werewolf
I can be a soo woo creature
I don't do phones, got beepers
I don't ride in cars, can't bleep us
New tattoo say, "Free Meech"
Show me how to treat this cougar

[Verse 3: Trae tha Truth]
I ball out the gym, ain't no doubt I'ma flex
What's on my neck cost a hell of a check
Diamonds like water, shit guess I was wet
Blow through this money, no worries, I'm set
No point in United, I just bought the jet
Still keep a tool on me, guess I'm a threat
Bitch ain't 'bout money, she sit like a pit
Nothin' personal, I'm just out here to finesse

[Verse 4: Skippa Da Flippa]
I used to jugg in the trap
Too many sacks, you think I'm Warren Sapp
I used to hit licks and bust down the cap
Now I get backends all over the map
I beg your pardon, no I'm not sorry
Twin turbo Flippa just copped a 'Rari
I charge a ten to see me party
My white boys on Harleys and they go gnarly
Ice ice ice baby
Ice ice for my lady
Nothin' but blue hundreds lately
He said he havin', I told him to save it
Bricks in the basement, just bought a Mercedes
VS stones, no inside
In the lab like I'm Bill Nye
New Bentley with the frog eyes
I been chasin' after dead guys

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Get my jewels up
Live like Jesus
Ice on me like
I got a fever
We trained to take from 'em
'Cause they wouldn't feed us
Now I got M&M's
'Round my visa
Feed the bitch pizza
Mauri gator got measles
Ready like werewolf
I can be a soowoo creature
I don't do phones, got beepers
I don't ride in cars, can't bleep us
New tattoo say, "Free Meech"
Show me how to treat this cougar[Trae]
I'm sick of losing family, everytime I blink my eyes
And at the rate that it's going, fell like I need to stay inside
Cause I don't wanna be the next nigga, to fall in a coffin
Lord knows everybody, that I love die often
Or wind up in the cage, and I don't seem to understand
It ain't nothing but a few of us left, I can count on my hand
If I tried to make a song, for everyone that I lost
I'd prolly have a triple c.d., in my deck when I floss
And that's a damn shame, people entertained by pain
I think I'm only selling records, cause I'm going through it mayn
I received a phone call, from my old man today
He was going crazy, cause his older sister passed away
And in my mind, I think she looking down smiling away
But still it hurt, I'm writing this and it ain't even been a day
At least I got to giver her a kiss, and told her I love her
Hey Christina, promise it'll never be another damn

[Hook - 2x]
I'ma keep thugging, till the day I drop
Cause it feel like I'm losing, everything I got
On my knees asking God, is it ever gon stop
But he don't answer me back, I hope he help me out

[Trae]
To tell the truth I'm never being happy, now-a-days
In my everyday living, will make a nigga wanna blaze
I don't smoke, so I'm running reality head on
All the pressure and pain, coming to me is dead wrong
Only time I get to smile, is when I see my lil' boy
If he only knew I'm riding down, for my boy
I ain't got too many friends, so I'm riding by myself
Your own kin'll try to do you, when on a mission for wealth
I was told, every person get a day of they own
I guess they skipped over mine, I been in line for too long
Why they won't leave me alone, I just wanna have a life
I'm sick of living in the dark, tripping searching for the light
I'm a soldier so I fight, till I'm running out of breath
And I ain't running from the devil, it's war until the death
Dear Lord help me out, I think you missing all my calls
My back against the wall, and I ain't got no time to fall at all

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
It ain't no mo' telling me, that it's gonna be ok
I watched the judge, try to throw my roll dog life away
It's safe to say, any day I'ma be checking in
With everything that I'm facing, they gotta let me in
I only rap about the struggle, cause it's all that I know
I'm assuming people hate me, because it's all that they show
I never asked to be a rapper, I was stuck with it
And fuck this shit, cause I don't fell I'm having luck with it
And it seem like I'm really tripping, sometimes
And I really want, is the Lord to show me a sign
Cause everything been rough, when it's coming to me and mine
Since it's raining everyday, I'll be praying the sun'll shine
But it don't, and on the real I don't feel that it will
I'm the last one left, until I end up getting killed
I wanna turn away, but still I know that it's real
And deep inside I pray, that the Lord'll be my shield, my pain is for real

[Hook - 4x](Dallas)
Ah no-no, the rain is falling down
I ain't forgot about you, say you
I ain't forgot about you, ah no-no yeah

[Hook: Dallas]
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
And though you gone, you still on my mind
I often wish that I, could kick it one more time with you
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
I wrote this song, to let you know I'm down
I know you know I'm down, I know you know I'll ride for you

[Trae]
I just thought that I'd clear my mind, off the top and represent my dog
DJ Screw you know that I miss you mayn, so every chance I get I gotta mob
Never thought I'd be doing this song, but time after time I feel like I'm alone
I could recall kicking it like G's, but now I reminisce going down my songs
It really hurt to see your T. Jones, feel the wrath that he reaching fo'
Everybody wanna be, Screwed and Chopped
But they don't know, it's bout to be smoked
They don't feel the pain that I feel, the love that I got for you is too real
We been down since back in the day, if you was still here I'd be down still
Everyday I gotta ride for the team, S.U.C. for L-I-F-E
It's bout time I let 'em know who we be, you the Don and now the world gon see
Ain't no way that I'm gon forget ya, in my mind I gotta paint my picture
You was the realest nigga, Down South
One day we'll meet again, and I'll kick it with ya

[Hook]

[Trae]
For Ro, you know you number one in my book
Everyday, I'ma hold it down
Even though you locked up, for a hell of a time
Ain't a day that pass, you ain't on my mind
I love you mayn, never put no one up above you mayn
So you know, that I gotta keep thugging mayn
Still all about you, and ain't nothing changed
You the reason I wreck, trying to get a platinum plack
For my brother Dinkie, I remember just what you told me
That niggas in the game, can't even see me
Me and Jay'Ton, fin to get your shine on until you get free
I'ma get my grind on, me and you
On another level it'll be that way, even when my time gone
I had to show, that you part of my heart
And it really hurt, when they split us apart
All I know is I still remember, I've been repping you since from the start
Everyday on my pen and pad feeling sad, seeing shit that we never had
All I know is what's mine is yours, for the good times or for the bad

[Dallas]
We still homies
Though we, be homies sometimes
But you know me
Cause we, be's homies
These be phonies, but real G's show me
That's what, you told me
That's why, I be homies - 2x

[Trae]
Kin folk I just got your letter, you and me we SK forever
You been gone, for bout three and a half
All of the times, is bound to get better
All I could say, is that we gotta ride
For the last and the time, you locked up inside
One day gon come, you bound to be free
When you hit that gate, I'll be right outside waiting
Donnie, you gotta hold your pride
I ain't forgot about you dog, everyday I ride
Everyday of the year, right by your side
Better believe, I'm keeping your name alive
And that's on the click
Even though, my pain might make me sick
My day coming up, and I'ma hit that lick
Then me and you, both'll have time to kick
Raise our kids like grown men, reminiscing like back when
Bleeding our block in a dead end, if time went back would I do it again
It's really hard to say, but I prolly would
Just to see your face, everyday got a time and a place
All I know is I miss you dog, South Klique for life and I'm still your ace

[Hook]

(Dallas)
I'm down down, while the rain is falling down
I'm dooown, I'm dooown yeeeah
Ah-ah no, ah-ah no, ah-ah uh, ah-no-na
I'm down I'm down I'm down jeah, you down yeah
Everybody down yeah, said I'm down for you ooooh yeah

[Dallas]
We still homies
Though we, be homies sometimes
But you know me
Cause we, be's homies
These be phonies, but real G's show me
That's what, you told me
That's why, I be homies - 2x[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Feel like ain't nowhere to run
Fight until they say "it's done"
Chances, I ain't never had one
That's on everything I love
Hate, I ain't never had none
Nowadays, I can barely see the sun
We're waiting on the day I come
Live until they take my lungs away

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
You don’t want it bad enough
You don’t want it bad enough
You don’t want it bad enough
You don’t want it bad enough
Took my chance when I had one
Standin', lookin' mad in the club
Spendin' like we don't give a fuck
Hundred, hundred Benz off the jump

[Chorus: Post Malone]
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down (yeah)
It's too late to slow down

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
I feel like I'm livin' to lose
Who the fuck gon' fit in my shoes?
I been patient for twenty years, put some respect when I move
Truth status won't be denied, I got no chances to lose
Dues, pay them now, got credit with a bunch of spectators  confused
The muse, tell 'em there ain't nothing better
That was feeling underneath the weather
I'll just hit it to you, they were six
Underwater, where is your umbrella?
Tell 'em I was only here to do it better
Than the ones who said I couldn't make it (make it)
Even if I don't, I gotta get position
So a sucker nigga couldn't take it

[Verse 4: Post Malone]
Yeah
I'm in H-Town, bumpin' and sippin'
Man, the purple shit is slowing down my vision
Why you mad, 'cause my roof gone fishing
Ain't a single problem with the way we're living
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
Every single second just to burn the sand
We done did that shit that you done said we can't
So when I pull up I'ma let my door slam
On that ass
Fuck what y'all say
And my wrist cold now, ayy
And it's just a start, ayy
But I can't slow down, slow down

[Chorus: Post Malone]
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down (yeah)
It's too late to slow down

[Verse 5: Post Malone]
Everybody want to know what I meant, cuh
Show up in the Vanni when the bitch tore down
Champagne always coming, I just pour it all out
I don't like the taste, I just know you in a drought
Bet it all out, let it all out
What was shorties name? Can't remember right now
Can't remember what you said when you was talkin' down
Tell me, how much did I spend? Can't remember right now

[Bridge: Trae Tha Truth & Post Malone]
Don't come around, if you ain't down
Play around, get lay down
A hundred rounds, a hundred rounds
You know that, you're outta bounce

[Chorus: Post Malone]
It's too late to slow down (It's too late)
It's too late to slow down (It's too late)
It's too late to slow down (Yeah)
It's too late to slow down

[Outro: Trae Tha Truth & Post Malone]
Don't come around, if you ain't down
Play around, get lay down
A hundred rounds, a hundred rounds
You know that[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth and Que]
Pull up on the block, it's like a motherfuckin parade
Middle of the Loove, feel like I'm standin on the stage
When I show my face, watch how the city celebrate
Cause it's a real nigga holliday
Trap, they love it, streets, they love it
The hood, they love it, the block, they love it

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Pull up on haters, tell m it was free
It was the truth, if not, it would be me
Everything black inside, you couldn't see
I'm presidential, nothin over me
It's Trae, nigga, runnin through m like a grayhound
All tthis shit around my neck, got me weighed down
Tell the bitches no time for me to play around
I only want it from the waist down
You ain't never seen it like this, no
I got your bitch in the sweets, nigga
Half a mill on bricks, nigga
Now what you talkin bout, bitch, nigga
Got them views from the 6, in my whip plates
Understand I'm the man up in this state
Got a 40 on my hand, so you know I stay safe
I walk a nigga down, homie, I don't get chaced

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth and Que]
Pull up on the block, it's like a motherfuckin parade
Middle of the Loove, feel like I'm standin on the stage
When I show my face, watch how the city celebrate
Cause it's a real nigga holliday
Trap, they love it, streets, they love it
The hood, they love it, the block, they love it

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
In the streets I'm king, no question
And I'm street for life, bitch, I'm a Texin
In the city, they say I'm a blessin
I just hopped out of something, I'm flexin
King Truth ain't nothin nice
And you think you see me when I'm with Price
I had to hit the roll, I ain't talkin dice
Say, bitch, I'm the one, ain't talkin twice
I could show you how to do it, nigga, take notes
See me sweatin through the streets, tryna get stokes
You ain't out for the money, stay broke
You better pay me what I want, I don't take quotes
New penthouse sweet, what I'm stayin in
I'm the heavyweight truth, ain't no weighing  in
All up in your girl body, what I'm playin in
Pull us over, you can tell m I was ABN

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth and Que]
Pull up on the block, it's like a motherfuckin parade
Middle of the Loove, feel like I'm standin on the stage
When I show my face, watch how the city celebrate
Cause it's a real nigga holliday
Trap, they love it, streets, they love it
The hood, they love it, the block, they love it

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Asshole by nature, nigga, no members
How I go to work, bitch, keep four hammers
Run the city, where they pour four numbers
At the bank gettin head like I'm in the manner
I'm just coolin, don't fuck up my energy
I admit it, we different, we enomies
I'm the man, I would never pretend to be
Paparazzi takin shots like it's Hennessy
New whip, you don't see the glare
New bitch, you don't see the ass
When I step out in the hood, you don't see the cash
When I pull up, better see the grass
I'm a fool, go retarded
Ballen, playin like I started
They stay watchin me, like I'm recordin
Shit was finished soon as I departed

[Chorus: Trae Tha Truth and Que]
Pull up on the block, it's like a motherfuckin parade
Middle of the Loove, feel like I'm standin on the stage
When I show my face, watch how the city celebrate
Cause it's a real nigga holliday
Trap, they love it, streets, they love it
The hood, they love it, the block, they love it[Intro]
I couldn't help, but notice your pain
(my pain), it runs deep share it with me

[Trae]
Ain't nothing changed, I still sit watching the time go by
I'm on a level of my own, cause motherfuckers too fly
They keep on calling me to stop, but I keep rolling on by
I ain't feeling them niggas vibes, and I'll be damned if I try
It's like I'm rolling by my lone, without my baby brother so I gotta post up
It's A.B.N. motherfucker, post up to get a close up
I'm leaning on the edge, my baby mama got me stressed
And plexing with me and my money, so I take it as a lesson
So my attitude, the true definition of nigga fuck you
I'm strapped up with fifty, gon make niggas let me done fuck through
I'm ten seconds from losing my cool, don't get up on me
I been fucked over too much, by some of my use to be homies
I won't let em see me sweat, cause if they do it's gon be hell
I know they praying that they see me fail, wishing I ain't well
Lord knows, I been fighting for all my life
So they know it's war, and I'm gon get em when the time is right

[Hook - 4x]
Ooooh-oooh-oooooh-ooooh
Welcome to, the Trae Tha Truth Show

[Trae]
They try to tell me bout the shit, I'm feeling now-a-days
Being real is all I know, anything else might be enough to get you blazed
So I play my position, and stay the fuck out that fake nigga type of shit
That gangsta false-a-fied, cause they read a fake nigga type of lick
Even these bitches dirty, I learned not to put my trust in em
A name with a lil' light, and these bitches'll let you bust in em
They tried to run me rugged, but homie my stat ain't never slipping
All I know is pain, and my finer show you that I ain't tripping
Yeah bitch I'm heavyweight, and I can't let em weigh me down
Niggas switching up and left the block, but see I'm still around
If you ain't ready for the ride, then turn the wheel around
Plus I got this clip under my belt, with about 38 rounds
They found my homie dead, murdered in the neighborhood
The love I had for him can't justify, it'll never be good
It hurt so much some of the time, I don't know where to go
But that's another episode, and it's part of the Truth Show

[Hook - 4x][Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Woke up outside of town a little bit lost
Little bit of Jack and the Yak caught in my mouth
Never knew my shadow would leave me out
I guess it was no will, no way, and no how
Burn that tree and burn it fast
Hopped in the DB9 and scurried off fast
The devil's a lie, we all know that
I guess it’s no way in or way out

[Hook: Travis Scott]

Kidnap, I ain’t with that

Lord knows if I get these drugs back to Texas

In the game with the work, I was set to score
Any brick I get I’ma strech for more
Took off in the valley, off next to blow
On the phone with the connect tryna check for dope
Any means I’ma get this dough

I chopped the top off a hard top

Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Chea, nightrider in the black Rolls, tell 'em I'm trippin'
On top of glass, covered in black, tell 'em I'm tippin'
Losing control, I'm lane to lane, you would swear I was slippin'
Prolly cause I told Edgar to spray 'em til he drippin'
Now paint wet, your bitch wetter
Got diamonds flooding my necklace
Gettin' head shots, I called that murder
Cause they ridin' slow like it's Texas
Got a attitude that don't give a fuck
Above 50 plus when I jet this
Lil test drive, I let her go out
Know I bet you hate that she meet this
I flex and pull these lights out
This mouthpiece I got iced out
I'm tricky bitch I'm racked up
Be damned if I get priced out
This haters ain't gon' say shit
They do, they gon' get wiped out
Do my donuts in broad day
Full speedin' with all my pipes out

[Chorus: Future & Boosie Badazz]
I chopped the top off a hard top

I'm tricken every single car I get (Uh oh)
I'm tricken every single car I get (Boosie Badazz)
I'm tricken every single car I get

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Gotta have a drop top, Lousiana a hot spot
If it ain't a drop, I send it to Cali and get it chopped
50 heads stay cocked so you can see the razorline
Former d-boy, I remember I used to break them down
Paint wet, ooh kill 'em like that
Boosie ridin' foreign and I paid 400 flat
Four 12's in the back, gotta have a little noise
Four deep on the mollies, we some real Ghetto Boys
In my yard, several cars, send 'em to my esé
Spray that thang candy but might wreck the whip the next day
Peanut butter inside, covered up in plastic
Stash spots everywhere, ride fly everywhere
Boosie!

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Chea, I'm in the hood, bitches yellin' they love me
Get in this coupe, you gon' be naked with body like Buffy
Why everytime I hit the block niggas faces get ugly?
Tell them haters I'm on my game and it ain't nothing above me
I live my money, get reckless
You seen that bitch that I just got
I'm Lil Wayne with no ceilings
Can't cool me down, bitch, I'm too hot
Can't change up I got change up
I got shit locked and they chained up
Bout 20 goons and they aimed up
Bitch, play with me, you get banged up

Artillery like Rambo
Don't fuck with me, I'm prime time
Don't get your whole show cancelled
Everythang gotta do get tuned in

Tell 'em hoes I'm gone now

[Chorus: Future]
I chopped the top off a hard top
I trick the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I C

        [Hook:]
Trying to figure it out again
They have me going around in circles
Even when i don't deserve it
I know it's gotta be worth it
So I’m trying to figure it out again
They got me going around in circles
I’ve been trying to stay focus
Even if you didn't notice
In my arms (do you see it )
Inside my arms

[Verse 1:]
Look yea it's funny how life ain't shit until you see the worst
Seen the pain felt by someone you love laying in a hearse
Like some of those feelings extinct
Everything down the drain you just stuck in the sink
Barely hold on but everything wrong with you gotta shot
Ready for the long road like you wouldn't block
Your feelings over but it's not searching for slots
Trying to get in where you can fit
Like someone on the top waiting on you
You hurting and your people hating
You ain't ever did them a thing and they heal saton on yah damn
All hope keep breaking on you
Trying to figure why you lose why they faking on you

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I feel you called up in int the permanent ways
Whole body going numb you been hurting for days
You don't know which way to go
Stuck in the maze
So I’m hiding in the church where they hiding for prayers
At the end of the tunnel light so bright so
Sometimes you gotta fight without might
Face it Life seems nothing is going right
It's not that quite but until you trying to focus
I know you about to fall just pray
Ain't nobody notice door closing but
Not body but you is chosen
And get that blessing you feeling belly rolling
Time ain't left at all like it's something stolen still
Trying to straighten up and hope that it's never over

[Hook]

[Outro:]
I make you believe yeah
I will I will I will[Intro – Young Thug]
I'm on molly, I'm on fuckin' molly
I'm on molly, I'm on muthafuckin' molly
Three hoes, let's have a trolly, have a fuckin' trolly
I wanna have a trolly, have a fuckin' trolly
Have a trolly, let's just have a trolly molly
Have a trolly, let's just have a trolly molly
I'm on molly, have a fuckin' trolly
Trolly, have a fuckin' molly

[Verse 1 – Trae Tha Truth]
I got shooters on the block, nigga, yea they somewhere on they bullshit
I got the city on standby, I green light, they even coming out the pulpit
Yeah, Truth pull up in that white thing, four choppas and the trunk full of white things
If it ain’t ten or better, I be out your price range, for the money, get shot, like a dice game
When I finished, to get to this bitch, tell her, "I will not keep her, just give me some nice brains"
I cannot lie, this bitch’s head is so stupid, like who the fuck gave her this nice brain?
Still the Truth nigga, remember that, I’m in this foreign, no ceiling, I done timbered that
I’m talking snow, but I ain’t talking where December at, I’m in the kitchen where they whip it up and send it back
Fly as them birds that get flown,I will not get off my throne
When it come to these streets, I am king, get the fuck out my home
Yeah I’m with the shit, I’m the shit you can’t finish, nigga jump fly, I’m tryna knock him out his tennis
I was born to be a G, better take a nigga in this, got diamonds in my grill, I ain’t never seen a dentist
I’m an asshole bitch, and my team gon rock out, I represent real niggas, no one can top out
I send my youngins to your block, they hop out, and snap the shit out a fuck nigga, no cop out

[Hook – Young Thug]
I got shooters if you try me, if you fucking try me
Pussy nigga try me, come on, fucking try me
I run Texas, bitches come and try me
Take your necklace nigga, come and buy it
Back, rat a tat tat
Back black back, rat a tat tat
Hey, I got bodies, I got bodies cause they tried to try me
I got bodies, I got bodies cause they tried to try me

[Verse 2 – Young Thug]
Got shooters in the bando
They salute me like commando
Add a bitch to the payroll
And she know how to put grams in her A hole
Imma talk to you when the case closed
And before I let down Imma lay low
I pour lean in OJ, no Mayo
Imma drink that little bitch like Faygo
I’m in Mexico with my plug gettin' them pesos by the caseloads
I’m in Dominican with my hoes doing everything I say so
Trae Tha Truth pulling up, whoo!
Keep that, nigga bitching like whoo!
Nah, freak that, whole night I won’t tell
No one check, that’s a secret
Your bitch waiting when a nigga ride by
She smelled the money on me, I can’t even disguise
I feel myself, so Texan don’t try
Po-po’s behind me, don’t text and drive
Crocodile isle nigga, shoes look like a gator
Leave em with a bald spot, like he play with the Pacers
Cooking with no hands, like I usually use a baker
I’m in her stomach like a naval

[Hook][Intro: Trae Tha Truth]
Jeah, you know they say the truth can get real ugly
I feel that

[Bridge: Lana Del Ray]
I've seen the world
Done it all, had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Hook: Lana Del Ray]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Jeah
I'm in the hood looking at life feeling so lost
I'm from the place where everything is fucked up
They say a prayer to the father with something tucked up
They only fear premonition of getting brushed off
They never thought about living only hoping they wouldn't die
Knowing death is around the corner, ignoring them like a lie
Turn back, even if they could they wouldn't try
Hoping they could sneak their way up in Heaven but couldn't fly
Lord come help us
I was looking for a blessing but felt like he left us
I was calling and reaching for him
So many they ain't even know 'em
Knowing that life I'm living here where he kept us
I sit and think about the truth and know many hate 'em
Cause he ain't pretty on the cool he was ugly as hell
That's fucked up, don't nobody wanna look in his face
They rather end up giving up or go sit in the cell
Sometimes I sit and still wonder what they love the truth
For everything we've been through
But life ain't easy, these lies we live is what they choose to accept
Knowing soon they going to crash they don't wanna believe me
I know they will, I know they will
All these nights out here for going to get that steel
Ain't nothing the same but the battle on the field
I tell them do better wishing they could know it's real

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Uh
Laid back in a five fifty with a
Fine dime brizzle rollin' five swishes
She already know my intentions with her
But she stayed down like a wine cellar
Cause she rather be under my umbrella
Cause the sky might fall that's some violent weather
Twenty five years, this is what I found out
Live it up, live it up 'til your time out
This is real life I don't know what they lyin' 'bout
Ballin' so hard you know what they cryin' 'bout
I pull up about nine bitches climb out
All different kinds from Dubai to makia
All bow at the line when you arrive at the hideout
And it's looking like a try out
A young nigga way off the meat rack little nigga welcome to the grind house
It's a whole different type of game
When it ain't about what the price 'bout
A young prince take time this is more than a vaca
This is more than a time out
But niggas so fake who these days
Shit should be a crime now
Real niggas chime in, fake niggas chime out
Bad bitches tuned in, Bobby Ray signing out

[Hook]

[Outro: Lana Del Ray]
The world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in, the new age now[Hook: French Montana]
Wake up, wake up
Nigga, it's the first of the month
Pay up, pay up
Buying all the drugs that you want
Wake up, wake up
Nigga, it's the first of the month
Pay up, pay up
Buying everything that I want

Moving ceiling but how long
Before these niggas try to G on their own
Now I'm moving ceiling but how long
Before these niggas stop trying to G on their own

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
So we in debt with the devil's daughter
Re-up this first quarter
Prices they going lower
This shipment fresh out the border
Yeah bitch I got it cheaper
Pumping just like a speaker
Hood say these niggas jacking
I lay 'em down like a sleeper
Kill this shit like the reaper
Trap finals, I'm a sweeper
Plus that shit you got weaker
I'm hands-on trying to freak her
Buried off in this bottle
What you need bitch, I got 'em
Here that shit bitch, I got 'em
Don't worry about it bitch, I got 'em
Carpooling with this work
I'm on this clock bitch, I work
Where them grimy niggas play in dirt
With something tucked in this shirt
The first and fifteenth I'm collecting these checks
Fuck if you a smoker or a hustler, just give me my checks
Yeah, wake up, wake up, nigga it's the first of the month
Just call me Pusha T, I get you anything that you want

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just can't leave this white bitch
My Cubans cut my mic switch
Loaded all up in my garage
YG say it might fit
Yeah, I got Whitney hostage
I got Bobby working
I got Screw jacked up
I only talk in person
Count this money like the bank
I'm trapping, what the fuck you think?
Inhale this loud up its dank
This gas, I ain't talking tanks
Top ten, I ain't talking ranks
650, I could get your drank
Look nigga, not no alcohol
That Texas shit that make you faint
Then I hit the NY with French
Did 305 with Ross
Then I hit the hood and took off
Shit, other than that, I get lost
I'm an H-Town bill collector
Anytime you lay this over
Look bitch, I practice work religion blueprintthem like Hova
Call me trapper man, I take it where the fuck others don't

[Hook][Hook: Charlie Berry - 2x]
I know a lot of haters, wanna see me gone
But I think, you better move on
If you wanna plex, then let's get it on
But I think, you better move on

[Trae]
Now that I'm grinding, I know a lot of hatas wanna see me gone
But I know they need to be moving on, somebody done told em wrong
About this Dirty 3rd block bleeder, who on the block full time
And now he got out of lock down, from coming out of hard times
A hundred percent with raw rhymes, never ever will I let them fade me
You better come with another raw plan, cause grinding in my blood baby
And it ain't no switching up the game, either way I'm gon get mine
Somebody, better get up out the throne
Cause that seat right there, finna be mine
I'm coming for the crown, so y'all better lay it down
I've been here from the jump, and when y'all leave I'ma still be around
Y'all ain't messing with Trae, I'm too hard to play with you cats
Coming at me sideways, I will run back and lean on you cats
You don't wanna take it to that other place, in these streets I'm forever safe
It's my turn so you better wait, all you niggas get up out my space
'Fore I get to tripping, I don't trust none of you haters
And fuck a friend I throw the deuce, ain't no seeing you later

[Hook: Charlie Berry - 2x]

[Trae]
I know the key to the city make it
And knowing you could never take it
Better get out the way, when Trae come out
And get a hell of a Guerilla, under-rated
Never operated, now I'm coming with it
When I spit, you know ain't no fucking with it
If you want it, I'm telling you come and get it
Everytime I come out, you fin to feel it
Ain't no way, that I'm fin to give up what I got
It's been a long time, to get on top
Knowing my pain, it's never gon stop
It really don't matter, because it got me hot
And that's how I take it, my foot on the gas full speed
Myself is all I need, I gotta provide to feed my seed
And if you think of stopping that
I'm letting you know, I ain't having that
I'm running right through you, to leave you flat
I gotta get paid, and that be that
Cause I'm a gladiator, renegator out the gutter
And living it, made me tougher
Hard times, done made me rougher
I guess that's what it is, that turned me out to be a man
I guess my hustle had me, keeping cash off in my hand
My older brother showed me, how to be everything that I am
And now I'm grinding everyday, I gotta ride for the fam

[Hook: Charlie Berry - 2x]

[Trae]
It's on the real, these niggas don't want no drama with Trae
They wanna bump in they place, so I stepped up in the game
Now they running away, if they wanted to see me
They wouldn't stop till they find me, I can handle my bidness
One on one, and now I'm leaving not one of my niggas behind me
Cause I can hold my own, the belt I'm fin to be taking home
Undisputed and known, to make a nigga wanna going on
And find another occupation, the rap game ain't for fake
A few of the real niggas still free, that don't give a damn about your hate

[Charlie Berry]
Everyday seems like they try
To stop my grind, everyday they sit and pray
Everyday, go away - 2x

[Hook: Charlie Berry - 2x]

(*Charlie Berry singing*)[Intro]
There is a Houston rapper who is taking um, a more hands on approach to his fellow Harvey victims, Trae tha Truth
Joined the growing list of volunteer rescuers after he was uh, rescued from his own home
One of the many reasons he has been honored, uh, by his home town for a decade now
There's actually a Trae day in Houston on July 22nd for his humanitarian work for this great Texas city
So Trae tha Truth is with me now, from the Convention Centre, and, and Trae...

[Verse 1]
So went down on my knees, I make a call to God like he the last one left
It's kinda hard to get through it, I'm still yellin' for help, it's like the whole world deaf
And though I'm tryna see through it, I'm feelin' life is miserable, ain't no point in even tryin'
They say it could have been worse and it'll prolly never get better watchin' the blind lead blind
You never know your position until it got use
Yeah, I know it ain't nothin' perfect about truth
I had this pain on lock, somehow it got loose
It's like we been through hell, somehow we got through
Watchin' the rain so hard, like, "What we gon' do?"
The sky was black, the rain was pourin'
Devastation, wind was blowin'
Water risin', overflowin'
The cried for help, and Lord, I'm goin'
I gotta do my best
Both feet in, water to my chest
Whole neighborhood's gone
Bein' able to do but wanna tell 'em it's okay
But I know it's amiss, I can't lie to 'em
I'm holdin' only, in a way, I was sayin' goodbye to 'em
A rescuse team in the sky, hopin' to fly to 'em
Yeah, they gon' get saved but don't apply to 'em
They really hurt 'cause all they can do is cry to 'em

[Verse 2]
The body count was risin', family members missin', others tryna survive
They all know the condition but yet, they help the alive
They need help 'cause they feel like they ain't gon' make it inside
Feelin' everythin' go, some was battlin' pride
They on they last leg
Everything was lost, help denied
Shelters closin', now they back outside
Home is gone, there ain't nowhere to go
Survival mode, it's go for what you know
Life is real, so now we on our own
Government was thrown and they was wrong
These circumstances, they really don't belong
Few denied, I told 'em I'd get 'em a loan
Bunch of people take advantage of the situation
Got the money and collect it with no hesitation
Put they face up in the camera like they here to help
Nod to the people, then they loosen with the frustration
What about the ones that hit rock bottom?
And the kids who traumatized by poverty?
It ain't the truth if I tell you they ain't a part of me
Ain't nothin' close when you feel like when you got so far to be
One thing for sure, I'm here to fight for 'em
Do right for 'em, tryna save life for 'em
Everybody need help but they need hope
Hopin' one day God'll end up bein' a light for 'em

[Verse 3]
Think of the survivors dedicated to front lines
Times they came and times they went
We sacrifice our life, countless how we spent
Children sleepin' on floors, some sleepin' in tents
Our faces covered in tasks, can't take the scent
Movin' on imposed days, only get worse
So many cries, swear to God you wanna get a nurse
We only wanna see us make it to a better day
Told 'em the love unconditional for what it's worth
Over 500 mill', why the city hurtin'?
Trae tha Truth, or Mr. Rogers, only people workin'
Our boots to the ground, gettin' holes in 'em
Heard people talkin' but their answers said they weren't certain
I gotta fight, I don't agree with how they doin' us
They say the city back to normal, that was new to us
I told a bunch of kids I got 'em for the holiday
A mansion, witnessin' less than a toothbrush
I feel like I wanna punch through a wall
I know a lot of people need this so I'm standin' up tall
Before they can fall
Relief ain't gon' last so they call
They helpin' the system, no matter if we riskin' or not
Although it's dark, tell 'em, "We are one"
It ain't never gon' be over until we are done
I know that one day we gon' see our sun
If there's any type of pressure, tell 'em, "We don't run"(*"What can I do" is repeated as a snippet to the beat throughout the song*)

[talking]
Asshole By Nature
I see you motherfuckers just determined
To make a nigga get on y'all ass
Roach ass motherfuckers
I don't know what to do with you beat up ass broke motherfuckers
See us in the streets......

[Verse 1 - Boss]
What can I do to get these hoe ass niggas out my mix
I'm straight from the block tryna get a brick
I ended up puttin shit down with the click
Now a bunch of niggas out ridin my dick
I'm a slide me a bitch, sit him in the 6
Put zip lock then I'm a hide me a bitch
No more pride for the bitch
Niggas get mad cause I bang to the left, and plus I ride when I switch
Stickin to the G guide line, peep them from the side line
Boss gotta big gat bitch I'm a hide mine
Got it ready to pop and put you on the high line
From my hot nine thinkin I would never pull out and pop mine
Bitch it's the maab, ridin our dick must be your big job
I might serve every nigga standin in your squad
Got G's from over seas, and places apart
You don't wanna fuck around
Put him in the middle of a 30-30 scope and I'm buckin him down
4 slugs hit e'm before he touchin' the ground
I'm in love with my rounds, I be lovin the sound
While I'm huggin four pounds, hoe made niggas better move when I'm 'round
Before my face show a frown

Hittin niggas up with that HGC and that 2-2-3 and I'm ditchin the town

[Verse 2 - Trae]
Guess who the fuck-top back in the do'
Seperatin from the plex with a beam and a scope
Hop fly I'm a hit a nigga dead in his throat
With a mac fully attack no force to let go
Might touch on a nigga like Shaq
Hit him in chest now he body rockin like Pat
When he size up I'm a put his ass on his back
Have his bitch ass runnin to the trunk for the gat-where the haters at
Better yet nigga why bother, I'm a pain in the ass like Antonio Tarver
ABN we opperate like the carter, and been G'd up since a nigga was starters
North to the South, South back to the North
East to the West let it go I set it off
We the team of the H plus we run with the south
Trae, Jayton, Z Ro the Crooked, and Lil'Boss
Hop in the L crank up ready to floss
Swoop through the block my frame ready-to-toss
Mouth piece gotta nigga bout to goin off
Cause my grill worth about 4 ki's in the south
Now what can I do about niggas like these
AK's to the chest will make them burn like trees
Forty-rounds out the clip will make them scat like fleas
Roach ass nothin type of niggas gotta bleed

(*"What can I do" repeated 'til end*)[Trae: {*talking}]
Naw*
What'chu mean nigga?
I ain't in to giving no muthafuckin pass
I done been quiet too muthafuckin long
Shit nigga how the fuck I let'chu out here
And I ain't told an ass what really go on
Naw nigga you got me fucked up
And if you with they ass you need to get the fuck up outta here
Fuck ass

[Verse 1:]
King of the year back yeah I'm something to feel
This here I'm gone with rapping bitch I'm back on the field
I'm bout to kick it with the realest why they gave me the shield
I never worry bout drama cause I'm a come with the steel
I feel it's me against the world I'm so sick of looking at rap
... they pussy that's why I kick it with the trap
Niggas check a nigga resume I beat it up and stack
Now it's only time they see me if I'm coming out the slap
Niggas call me what'chu want it's goin be hell when I break through

Cheeah!
[Talking:]
Like I don't know what the fuck they really thinking
LIke I ain't goin get out there and do what I do best
And that's expose a bitch
I giva fuck about a motherfucker feelings
When nobody ask out here when I was on my own
Only motherfuckers who kept me living was the streets
So if you ever think you can deceit what I got going on
Kill yourself, dumbass

[Verse 2:]
Ay
Fuck em fuck em you can tell em that I said so
They ain't never seen the type of shit that I done play it fo'
Tell em I represent for all my niggas who was dead tho
I keep my head high in any weather why you head low
You never seen convicted I'm a permanent pain on em
2010 I'm the permanent stain on it
It ain't go out the gate I put a permanent claim on it
Put the clicky out the trunk and put that permanent rain on em
The king in this bitch all niggas better head home

This is dedicated to all that said I wouldn't sell
Tell they ass kill theyself I wanna see em go to hell
Niggas talk about they nick gimme the square and I'm a lean on em
Put it on em ass even if they got a team on em

[Talking:]
I guess real niggas just need to give up
Timid ass niggas
You know I finally came to the conclusion
I guess I'm probably ain't nothing like you muthafucker
That's why I ain't accepting so easy
You know half these muthafuckers out here rapping
Really ain't what that is
And one thang I know I remember
"Birds of a feather flock together"
Read between the lines nigga
But I'm a tell you one thang
Fuck with me, and I'm a show you how it go down foreal
(They breaking the code)
I giva fuck who turn they back on me
(Where they do that at?)
It could be radio, it could be fans
(It ain't no loyalty homie)
It could be gay ass niggas that got a muthafuckin problem cause I'm out here foreal
Tell them see me when they see me nigga
You can't ban me[Hook:]
What the fuck are you on you must be out of your mind
Today why are you calling my phone
You probably don't like what I’m about to say
What in the fuck do you want
What in the fuck are you on

[Verse 1:]
It’s time you never been with those hoes who hyped you
To ever think that i ever had a bitch just like you
Now that i think about it that bitch had to go too
I kept my book closed and told her to rewrite it
Calling my phone but you ain’t nothing to me but bad time
Drawing me out of my life bitch just trying to crash mine
I ain't trying to hit it you worst than a bad rhyme
Probably starting to tweaking like you going off a badline
But niggers still out here trying to stick up on her
Tell the fucking truth you probably trying to down him
Every day i spent with you was well wasted
Trying to get away you only drama
Nobody tell my bitch sex you and not tell her
Then say you for every body like you a cerebellum
Fuck you and fuck love girl I’m a repella
Your life based on bull shit you coudl’nt smell her
Never mess with my business and stay the fuck out of my inbox
All this shit is problem and understand this is where this shit stops
Move girl say another word and you going to get dropped
So put your ass up like a barbershop to get chopped
They say misery loves company
No exceptions for what you done to me
You must be out of your damn mind since you out of line
Now you out the way I’m doing fine

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
There is nothing bitch you going to rewind
You better go ahead
Always running from the real why the fuck you scared now
You only open your mouth i opened you legs
Searching for a way to shine i guess you all about the bread now
It ain't nothing that you were saying that i was trying to hear
All this bullshit that you was doing now kinda make it clear
You bullshit 360 days out of the year
I’m the captain of the ship you ain’t ever goin to stare
Why the fuck are you on my line there is no calling me for time
You better stop it like you a sign
You going to bump into trouble like you were blind
Like how you play the game you out of bind
Trying to keep up with what your homies got your ass working
Fuck up with your head now your ass searching
Ain't nobody out here want you so your ass hurting
So like drunk and in love keep your head surfing
If the shoes fit too late to put on someone else that shit on you
You pointing fingers you better take what you dishing out
It ain’t a way to flip it girl this shit on you
They say misery loves company
No exceptions for what you done to me
You must be out of your damn mind since you out of line
Now you out the way I’m doing fine

[Hook](*talking*)
It's repo time motherfucker
If you owe me, I'm here to collect
All that roaching and reaching
I'm fin to put a stop to this shit nigga
Trae the Truth, Asshole By motherfucking Nature
Don't use my motherfucking name, for no pass out here
I ain't putting no stamp on that shit

[Trae]
Bitch I'm here to collect and flipping on Patrone, in a '67
I got the trunk stocked up like the law, but shit gaurunteed to make a felon
So it ain't shit to be talking about, unless it's money your checking
Or the fact they ass about to get touched up, in about less than three seconds
If you owe me you better pay me mine, or get served like some gangsta shit
But I think you better think a bit, and remember I'm a gangsta bitch
All these niggas roaching my name and my face, like I fuck's with they ass
I bet they switch it up, with this right foot of mine stuck up they ass
I'm like a problem, that'll come get a nigga when he least expect it
Ain't no friends in this bidness, just money and power respected
I don't do no credit or give no loan, and don't do no consignment
If I do it's on the block, to lead you in coffin confinement
And I ain't thinking twice, my advice nigga pay the price
Why you capping trying to wear that ice, try me and you can pay for life
I'm Trae the Truth, and I'm the one that they told you to dodge
Cause it's A.B.N., and we issue ass whooping's for a job

[Hook]
Where my money
I need-I need-I need cash (Trae) - 4x
Where my money
You don't want to be here, when I blast (Trae) - 4x

[Trae]
If you owe me consider it double, try something fly I'm gon get ya
I ain't trying to hear none of that shit, bitch I'm here to collect my issue
Consider me doing your ass a favor, if you still able to breathe
If you ain't got it then I can remind you, that you still able to bleed
I operate off my cash, if my cash slow that's your ass
Why you thinking of trying to roach, I just came to revoke your pass
Give me whatever you got in your stash, you delinquent at paying funds
Don't make me lead you by example, it's dangerous playing with guns
That ain't a threat hoe that's the truth, and I'm willing to bet it all
And if you play with Trae the Truth, then I'm willing to bet you fall
Who the fuck gave these niggas they nerves, thinking they hard as a brick
It don't matter, I'ma bring they ass back down to reality quick
And you know what it is, nigga don't act like you don't
Bitch I invest in the block, and they know I get what I want
Right off the muscle you piss me off, and you gonna be a sad man
When it come to money, call me a bad bad man

[Hook](*talking*)
Mr. Rogers huh, fuck em up this time around homie
Hard on these motherfucking tracks, let's get on em huh

[Hook - 4x]
Sitting on white bricks, wrapped in duct tape
Thirty minutes flat, I could bake a whole cake

[Trae]
Still sitting on the white bricks, while they wrapped up in duct tape
In the do' panel of the rental car, finna slide the Interstate
I'm grinding and I heard that it was a drought, and the FED's was on they way to sweep
Even if they was, Tuesday and Thursday ain't part of my week
But dig this here homie, I'm only out here trying to get it
Every couple of months, I'm trying to stack another ticket
Quit it then I move around, so these niggas don't know my bidness
Give my brother K my sister P, the work until the finish
Plus I got Columbian connects, to fuck a nigga price off
And they know it's real, fuck with me and they gon fuck your life off
Never seen the Federal Pen, and I don't plan on getting by one
Material witness come, I load the talons and I fly one
I holla at the Snowman, when I feel it need to snow
And if it pump we gon jump to the mood, and work it then resco'
For trappers that's all they know, and we gon shine it when the time is right
Duck off in the day and move at night, cause you know we still

[Hook - 4x]

[Boss]
Still sitting on white bricks, in the hood
I ain't no motherfucking fool, I wish these bitch niggas would
Got birds strapped under the hood of my low-low, middle finger pointed up for the po-po
Got that pistol grip pump in my lap, riding out on the solo
Got a call for three 9's, but I don't sell no pistols
I'm in distribution for selling soft sacks, with them crystals
Cocainia hit em like missles, when they snort that first line or two
Take over the whole neighborhood, is what I'm trying to do
So I don't do no cutting, when it comes to this work
When trouble come the pump'll start barking, but it won't chirp
But I been waiting for one of you niggas, to get out of line
I'mma start hitting niggas, up in the line one at a time
With that H.G.C. like, Lil' Boss up in his G Nike's
Under the street lights, trying to get rid of the rest of this whizzite
All it take is one whistle, and the homies is coming
I strapped all them niggas up, so when they get hit ain't cutting cause I been

[Hook - 4x][Intro]
Yeah, like what they fuck they doing, supposed to stop what I'm doing
Ok

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
What the fuck you niggas thinkin', bitch I run the town
Somebody tell them pussy niggas I was chopper down
Shots fired they can't get your ass up off the ground
It's a celebration bitch come get this other round
They say the streets went kinda quiet bitch you wouldn't loan
I heard the shit ain't been the same, I guess I'm coming home
I guess it's time for me to show you other niggas clones
Fuck with me I cancel your service, I ain't talking phones
And then I'm back to getting money like a bank account
I'm on my hustle nigga fuck what niggas thinkin' 'bout
My respect bitch, it's something you ain't ranking out
I send 'em in a hoop, couple niggas hanging out

[Hook: Trae tha Truth]
Who the fuck you pussy niggas got a problem with

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Niggas got a problem, I got solutions
No security, snatch my chain and I'ma shoot you
A chance of robbing me?, we don't need a judge
All we need is pistols, hollows, point some slugs
All we need is drugs, we don't need a lug
I get millions out the streets what you bring to the table
That's boss talk, that's independence
If she's hella good, way good [?]
I may buy your baby mama a Bentley (skrrr!)
Just to piss you off, take the hoe to [?]
I hate these pussy niggas with a passion
Pussy niggas out of style like some old fashion

These young brothers, see that wall?
They're not playing
They'll kill concrete
Young black man is so bad he'll burn walls
He's mean, what made him so cold?
That they would fire at one another

[Hook]
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
If it ain't him and it was you I'll try to kill each other

[Verse 1]
Why is it drama? Lil' homie why is  it murder?
Why is it hot outside the day we beefing like burgers?
They starving the dealer, show up at the table like servers
Niggas are sinister, knock you off of the block like a hurler
Everyone watching, better have the heart of a lion
There's somebody dying, they unloading the clip without trying
Mamas are crying, babies bellies needing their fathers
They keep to the minute he never cam back home, didn't bother
Is it his fault? Or is it cause he's looking for stripes?
Thuggin' in traffic, but trying to miss those colorful lights
He's booking the system, find him somewhere deep in the night
I pray he don't loose it,  waiting on the day he get right
Come on

[Hook]
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other

I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
If it ain't him and it was you I'll try to kill each other

[Verse 2]
Why  is it gangster? Why are they not thinking about living?
Permanent sinner loosing everything and not winning
Passing the church, tell the preacher that he wouldn't finish sinning
It's going to be a minute, catch him on the corner, he's bending
Why is it pride? Why is he out looking for power?
Loading a 40, trying to make it rain like a shower
Pray you get prey, probably why he trying to devour
He'd rather die real, before he'd either go like a coward
Burning the flag, tell them he ain't throwing no towel
Running with shooters, only trying to play with the foul
He is not tripping, it's gonna be whatever you're perplexing
He is the muscle, people end up stiff when he's flexing
Yeah

[Hook]
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other

I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
If it ain't him and it was you I'll try to kill each other

[Verse 3]
Why is it genocide? Why are they out banging for colors?
He's in it to win it, tell them he ain't thinking about others
Play with his money, he might just put the clip in his brother
I can't understand it, trying to down the kid of his mother
Why would you try him? He spent half his day trying to fight them
Nothing can buy him, cause he knows the world wants to fry him
Watching the coroner try to find a way to supply him
Body for body, aiming at your tee and they dying
What is the business? Trying to hit them something like tennis
Still in the hood, modern day society menace
He's playing for keeps, know if you don't get them your finished
If you think evil, nothing good but dimes in his image

[Hook]
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
We in the zone and everybody's trying to kill each other
I pray to God to see the day that we could feel each other
If it ain't him and it was you I'll try to kill each other

Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

Now this is something
Now this is something[Hook: Problem] (x2)
Everyday of my life tryna get it
Ingle' to Roma to Wright
But everybody still wid it
But everybody still wid it

[Verse 1: Problem]
Half a pill for the turn up
Marijuana aroma, block is hot as tacoma
Coppers hitting the corner
Baby mama's is texting
Met me a new bitch now baby mama's is stressing
School it couldn't get the lesson
Thank the Lord for your blessings
Even if you do it bad everyday by is for lessons
Lights, I'm on constant
Flights, cause I'm smoking
Good, yeah I'm living life to the fullest
Yeah I'm the nigga cause I motherfuckin chose to be
Now it's finally the way that it's supposed to be
Tread [?]  with the bread spend it low for me
And bitch you can't unless you buy a gold roll for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
I'm focused, hustling til I get death
Chasing after this paper, get to it like I won't get left
Robert with this De Niro like I don't envision shit else
Stop with the [?] bitch your ass ain't touching else
In the streets like a flash light, haters meant that I shine on em
I heart they're taking [?] but they deal em when I put mine on em
Touch down and put that [?] on em
[?], recline on em
[?]bitch to their checkers, never rush, I take my time on em
I hear they talking down, oddly cause I'm too above niggas
I tell em suck my dick, no second guessing, ain't no love nigga Money done ride my dick, tell em to kiss my ass
And watch me kill em everyday like its my last

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Everyday I smoke a ciggy [?]
Blessings in the month of Ramadhan
Thousands of people line up just to see a nigga rhyme
Ball [?], I get lawyer to pay for a nigga time
Clock in by the hour, guns [?] from powder
Really [?] started ESGN  and got niggas sour
That bitch can't come around here
Niggas just won't allow her
But if I catch her out bet that pussy gon' get devoured
Pimpin, keep it in me, I keep a cold ass bitch
Had to cuss some niggas off, that was on some ho ass shit
Hurt my heart, it was some niggas I used to throw down with
Now I ain't got shit to give ya ass before the programmes begin
I live my life

This money that I got I ain’t get for free
Your fake diamonds are offending me
You better get up out my face

[?]
Yeah I’m a fool with it
I was running through the H with a few hoes

On the way to King John with a few chains
When I pull up to the shop those get froze

Hustle like folk with your bank
Diamonds so clear they was blank
